0;"12oz bottle; bottled-on date Sept '10.		Pours a black ink color with a dark tan head. Chunky head is massive, a bit overzealous for its own good.	Scent is strong with vanilla and hints of sweet chocolate.	Flavor is decidedly bourbon initially; vanilla comes through much more strongly as it warms, with added hints of cocoa and wood.	The body of the beer is strange; the rockiness from the head creates a fizziness in the mouth but the beer itself feels flat, creating an undesirable mouthfeel.	This one is barely drinkable, even in cold weather. The vanilla is too strong, without any accompanying roasted malts, and the body of the beer is all over the place.";0;0;0;1
1;"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass. Formed a thick single finger head, the color of creamy coffee. Quick dissipation leaving behind no lace. Black, Black body...like a glass full of melted asphalt. You cannot force light through this...		The nose is a combination of chocolate, coffee and molasses. Roasted malts and caramel in the background. 		The taste starts out with a sweet creamy caramel flavor that fades into a bitter coffee finish. The roasted malts are in the background throughout, keeping everything in perfect balance. Black coffee aftertaste lingers, making you want more!		The mouth feel is on the thicker side, very creamy with little carbonation...almost perfect!		A very drinkable beer. The ABV is well hidden in the complex flavors. Super example of the style!";1;0;1;0
2;"Pours a cloudy honey like color with a thin layer of white head. No lacing and poor retention.		Aroma has a familiar sweet wheat and citrus quality.		Taste is pretty pathetic. Slightly malty with a wheaty tone. 		Mouthfeel is very thin and watery with a robust carbonation.		Drinkability is bad, flavors aren't there, mouthfeel is weak. Probably best served through a funnel.";0;0;0;1
3;750 ml bottle courtesy of myspoonistoobig. Thanks Michael. Pours a very dark brown close to black with a small darkish tan head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The is big coffee, some dark chocolate, some vanilla and a bit of bourbon, oak, and some light alcohol. Quite awesome. The initial taste is sweet with dark chocolate, then comes a lot of coffee. A decent amount of oak as well as a bit of vanilla and some bourbon. The maple is there as well, but not overpowering. The finish has a decent coffee bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Great beer. A substantial improvement over KBS. The coffee is quite strong, and the maple sweetness is not overpowering, which I was slightly worried about.;1;1;1;1
4;"A: Hazy amber in color with a half finger head that dissipates to a fine lacing on the top of the brew.		S: There's definitely a pumpkin aroma present along with the usual pumpkin spices, nutmeg, some light cinnamon and light toffee and malts.		T: A sweeter malt character with a light bready pumpkin in the background along with mild spices.		M: Light on the tongue with a medium bodied flavor. Mild carbonation.		O: Overall, on the lighter end of pumpkin beers, but while the pumpkin is lighter, it has more 'pumpkin spice'. Quite tasty.";1;1;1;1
5;"Hakim Stout...in a bottle at Queen of Sheeba Restaurant		Appearance-pours a thick black, minimal head seeps out of the glass, thin viscocity.		Smell-charcoal and chocolate mixture, malt is apparent, slight hop flavor as well.		Taste/Mouthfeel-muddled, light chocolate taste, alcohol fumes, light coffee notes, subdued flavor, watery mouthfee, notably thin.		Drinkability-a little jumbled		Overall-not as successful as their other beer, a muddled weak Stout, not recommended.";0;0;0;1
6;"Got this one from the Brewery at the last fest, one of the soon to be forgotten Big Bottles... 		Poured with not too much head, left only a little bit of a slight, white ring on the edge... tiny bubbles. Dark amber, almost a light rootbeery colored... nice. 		Scents of dry hay. Sweet malt. 		Teensiest of a bit from the carbination and flavors, but nice and mild altogether. Leaves alot of flavors in your mouth. Easy drinking and just enough taste to not be boring, but not enough to be heavy or overpowering. Good one overall.";1;1;1;1
7;"A - Poured a pretty and clear, light straw color with about a two finger head that dissipated after about 5 minutes. 		Smell - Herbal and grassy hops aroma with a hint of citrus. A typically good pilsener.		Taste - Very good balance between sweet malt and hops, maybe leaning a bit in favor of hops. 		Mouthfeel - A bit of a heavy mouthfeel due to the sweetness but carbonation was good and long-lasting which helped offset the heaviness.		Drinkability - It would be tough to drink more than a few of these because of the heaviness, but it's a decent pils.";0;0;0;1
8;"A - A slightly cloudy version of your standard ale		S - Overly spiced and overly sweet 		T - My wife and I often argue on what pumpkin pie spices should be. I make mine with cinnamon, clove and nutmeg as the major spices, she insists on adding allspice. This would be her type of pie if it were not for the abuse of the nutmeg and allspice - just too much,		M - The carbonation almost hurts and makes the rest seem so thin.		D - Only quickly if nothing else is around.		I am biased on pumpkin ale because I brew this stuff twice every holiday season. I feel that the ale should be seasoned and enjoyable. You should notice the spice and pumpkin but not be knocked over by it. For those who look for the extras in the beer, this is probably a good one. If you are seeking something that might give a faint reminder of a good pumpkin pie, this will be a bit much. 		I don't know where all the sweetness is coming from (could be the over spiced part) but it is also a bit to overpowering.";1;1;1;1
9;"Purchased at Eagle River Liquor in Fulton, Illnois: The best beer store no one shops at. 		Excellent pint glass pour sticky honey orange with a gigantic, retentive head that laces and laces and oh my goodness it is so pretty.		Smells of big, layered hops. Orange, grapefruit, fresh flowers, dried roses, and brown sugar. Wonderful!		The nose comes through perfectly in the taste! Starts with a bittersweet, floral hop, that moves into the more bitter and sour citrus and grape fruit middle and segues almost perfectly into a strong brown sugar caramel malt. The balance is damn near perfect.		Yet another excellent beer from the folks at Founder's. The perfect balance makes this one of the easiest-drinking IPAs I've ever come across.";1;1;;1
10;"Thanks to wedge421 for this brew!		A: pours a nice copper color.. Nice full finger fluffy head.. Leaves a nice lace..		S: definitely get those amarillo hops! Citrus notes (mostly grapefruit), caramel malt, subtle spiciness from the rye. Reminds me of Arrogant Bastard.		T: has a spiciness upfront with small booze presence.. Then the grapefruit bitterness flavors pull through.. Caramel malts also come through.. Has a clean rye spiciness for the end. Also some more lemon/grapefruit bitterness & maybe some pine.		MF: well carbonated medium bodied brew.. Very smooth drinker..		D: a good easy drinker... Kinda impressed me.";1;1;;1
11;I picked this up at the jungle in Fairfield, OH. This is a super malty brew. It seemed to me the alcohol was far more prominent. This was way to strong in my opinion and I will not be purchasing this angain. The Founder's Red Rye is a far superior offering and much more balanced and enjoyable.;0;0;;1
12;"Purchased from Target in Jones Valley, Hunstville, AL.		Pours a light yellow body with a thick, foamy white head. Other than the color, this beer looks almost perfect, nifty and inviting.		At first all I got from the nose was this vaguely skunked, grassy, pilsener-like quality. After the head settled and I put my nose a little deeper into it, I got a touch of an almost Belgian-like yeast funkiness. And of course the requisite corn and utter absence of hops.		Taste... it's like getting kicked in the face. The funkiness hits hard on the palate, puckering the lips and making the beer even harder to swallow. Very dry, astringent quality to the aftertaste. Cloying and nasty. 		Weak and watery mouthfeel.		I can't even stand this stuff long enough to drink the single. Drain-pour.";0;0;;1
13;"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass.		Appearance: Pours a translucent, pale, golden color with a small, fizzy head that dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing. Standard lager stuff here...		Smell: Smells pretty clean, like most lagers. However, there is a faint hoppiness in the nose backed by a faint sweetness.		Taste: Fairly hoppy up front. Towards the back, it becomes bready and a little sweet. It has a good balance to it. Some poorly made lagers tend to be overbearing in sweetness but this one seems to have it about right.		Mouthfeel: Crisp, clean, and refreshing.		Drinkability: A thoroughly drinkable and enjoyable lager. This is really a no-brainer beer that you can just kick back and enjoy a few of. It also continues to solidify Mountaineer as a surprisingly good local brewery for me.";0;0;;1
14;"Thanks to redbird for this one.		A: A bit light in color but it's well within the range that I've seen. The color is yellow gold with a white head that leaves good lacing.		S: A bit generic for a DIPA but still very hoppy and delicious. The caramel malt is there underneath the hops, but it gets a little boozy in the aroma and flavor.		T: Orange and floral hops dominate. There's enough malt to hold up to the hops, but it doesn't quite blend as well as the best DIPAs. Again, a bit boozy and not quite bitter enough for my taste.		M: Good, oily with hop essence.		D: It's definitely a good beer, but it doesn't stand out from the pack of DIPAs for me. Good beer but there are better entries in the style.";1;1;;1
15;"Reviewed from notes	Sampled on 11-25-07		Pours a dark brown color, with a little bit of red peeking around the edges. No real head, no real lacing.		Smell is very smoky, the only thing I can associate it with is beef jerky. Very sweet and unusual, but in a good way.		Taste is an even bigger hit of beef jerky. The sweet malt is more pronounced, with a huge smoky finish.		Mouthfeel is good, super slick, but a little thin for me.		Drinkability is very good, a very smooth and well balanced brew.";1;0;;0
16;"A: Deep orange/amber body... thin tan head... lots of lacing.. looks like it will be good.. could use a tad better head retention...		S: Lovely burst of citrus hops... some floral and pine notes give it a complex presentation to the nose... slight toasted malt notes come through towards the end.. some caramel goodness...		T: Follows the nose to a T as far as delicacy and complexity... just a little softer in its punch... the 168 ibus dont pack as much punch here as they do in the nose... still this is good... nice if not balanced...		M: Smooth with a crisp finish... there is a slight watery feel right before the finish... there is a nice resiny feel to it overall though		D: the 8.2% abv is perfectly hidden... hoppin frog has a pretty good one here.";1;1;;1
17;"Pours out a really clear brown with no suds. This is probably a bad beer.	Smell is caramel malt and sugar and alcohol.	The beer is probably bad because nothing tastes right here. Very bland and very watery.	I will pour this out. It is terrible.	I will be sick in the morning from this nasty beer.	Um how many characters do I have now? I think I need at least twohundredandfifty.";0;0;;1
18;"Appearance: coppery gold-brown, slight haze, big layer of spongey yellowy foam with good retention		Aroma: a slightly soapy hop scent with caramelly malt and a bit of roast		Flavor: medium malt sweetness that was surprisingly prevalent for the first few sips; dries out a bit for a hoppy semi-dry finish; THEN the hop bitterness starts to build up until each successive sip begets an evermore throaty bitterness		Mouthfeel: medium body, light carbonation, astringency 		Other comments: I expected more of a punch in the face with hops (given the 105 IBUs). This was more like hops grabbing me by the throat. I bought two 22oz bottles of this thinking I would bring one to my brother in law in Florida so he could try a NW beer with a boat-load of hops, but I don't think I'll bring this. Distinctly underwhelming and poorly composed.";1;0;;0
19;Pours amber with excellent clarity- a little strange for a true zwickel, I expected some more cloudiness. A decent head, especially for a growler. It sticks around for a bit as swirly cap. There is a little bit of a lager twang in the nose, and there is a certain nuttiness, and some herbal notes in both the nose and taste. Almost a chamomile back note. The predominant characteristic of the beer, however is a deep herbal bitterness and a smooth but slightly tannic finish. Really quite good, and surprisingly balanced by the yeasty lager notes. I love to find wonderfully drinkable low abv session beers like this. I knew I had to do some serious yard work this weekend in the steamy Atlanta weather, so picked this up as my reward. Perfectly hit the spot!;1;1;;1
20;"Most of the time when I say a beer is gold I mean that it's just a nice shade of yellow. But this beer--this is GOLD. This is like enhanced, QVC jewlery kind of gold. 		Smells weakly of simple malt. Very weak. 		Tastes very much like it smells. Seltzer water up front, moving into a slight hint of sweetness, ending in the horrible malt of a macro. Mix Bud and club soda and this is what you get.		This is a pretty beer but that's it. Avoid.";0;0;;1
21;"A- Slightly hazy and golden in color with a very small white head than settles to some splotchy patches. 		S- Citrus and caramel notes. Very clean smelling. Ever so slightly vegetabely and alcoholic.		T- Citrusy with a solid caramel and biscuit malt backing. The alcohol is apparent, but not in a harsh manner. Not all that complex, but enjoyable none-the-less.		M- Overall pretty smooth and not all that harsh. The alcohol leaves a very dry and crisp aftertaste.		D- Good, but not all that memorable in the long run. I don't know if I would go out of my way to seek this out, but I enjoyed it for what it was worth- a solid DIPA.";1;1;;1
22;"A - Solid black with 2 fingers of creamy mocha head that eventually settles to a skim of foam with webbed lacing.		S - Dark chocolate, roasted malt, espresso, and hints of pipe tobacco.		T - Slightly sweet but quickly changing to a lingering bitterness, milk chocolate mixed with dark chocolate, roasty malts and burnt coffee.		M - Silky smooth and creamy, feeling rich at times (almost making it a bit heavy to drink several in a row) with a lingering dry bitterness.		D - The strong flavors with the big mouthfeel might make it tought to drink a 6 pack but this is up there with the best American porters I have tried.";1;1;;1
23;"A: Clear gold pour with 1 finger of white foamy head with lots of lacing.		S: Grainy skunk aroma and some citrus hops. Nothing too impressive.		T: Grainy and grassy flavors are predominant, with a bitter hoppy finish. Very nice balance between the malts and hops, especially for the style.		M: Light bodied, with good carbonation. 		O: Crisp, drinkable beer. Pilseners aren't my favorite style, but I think this one is done quite well.";1;1;;1
24;"On tap at the brewery on 06.30.2007; listed at 10.5% abv.	Served in a 9 oz snifter.		Opaque color in color beneath a creamy coffee-colored head that leaves broken, ringed lacing down the snifter. Dark chocolate, espresso, dark fruity-esters, and a lingering aroma of bourbon. Rich and chewy milk & dark chocolate flavors, along with notes of mocha and rolled oats. Vinous fruit flavors with a mild smokiness prior to a burst of pine-filled hops. The finish is slick and is followed by a warming, robust bourbon aftertaste. Full in body; silky smooth/syrup-like on the palate. A well crafted, full-flavored Imperial Stout. Dap to CBC for the Phish reference, and yes...I enjoyed your stout very much.";1;1;;1
25;"I had this beer poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass...		A: The beer is a crystal clear straw yellow color with a decent white head and decent lacing...		S: The smell is of strong alcohol and grain...		T: The taste is wretched. Its very strongly of alcohol, and light grain flavor which tries to remind you that is somewhat still a beer...		M: Smooth and too heavy for a beer meant to be chugged...		D: A pretty bad beer, one of the worst malt liquors I have had.";0;0;;1
26;"A: KBS pours jet black in color with a small mocha colored head that dissipates immediately leaving a few floating bubbles. Light does not penetrate the beer.		S: Strong hints of bourbon, vanilla, and coffee		T: This is most balanced bourbon oaked beer I have ever had. The first thing I taste is bourbon and vanilla followed by rich dark coffee . The flavors really compliment each other, nothing is overpowering. The aftertaste lingers for quite awhile.. I wish it lasted forever.		M: Very smooth and creamy with a medium body. Carbonation doesn't appear in the head but it's definitely there and perfect for the beer.		D: MOAR";1;1;;1
27;"I purchased this from the brewery. Mindestens haltbar bis Ende: 8/06.		A: Murky brown; fluffy, slightly off-white head. A little retention and lace. (Colour is closer to a dunkel weizen).		S: Overwhelmingly smokey, with an underlying sweetness (caramel, fruit?). Like a banana that's been caramelized over an open fire. Quite nice.		T: Flavour has a little more depth than the aroma (taste isn't overwhelmed by smoke). It's like a smoked banana bread, with some nobel hop spicyness, and a hint of caramel malt sweetness (it's well balanced).		M: Moderate body is very creamy. Carbonation is moderate.		D: Good, but fairly smokey.";1;0;;0
28;Remarkably smooth easy-drinking smoked. The smoke is there but its understated under a delicious malt mix. Its on my lips well after I have completed it. It was great with BBQ. Greyish golden coloured body, small head. Mild smoke aromas. A tad above average mouthfeel.;1;1;;1
29;This beer pours a murky amber color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of bakers chocolate with cherry juice. The taste leans more toward the cherry juice with a lingering aftertaste of bakers chocolate. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this beer is a rancid drain pour. There is no possible way I will ever drink this again.;0;0;;1
30;Dusty looking deep auburn toned body. Thin and bubbly beige head leaves little lace. Thick caramel malts on the nose with a hint of alcohol and some tropical notes as well. Smells like a malt forward barleywine. Body is medium full, but the carbonation is quite low. Bordering on flat, but not quite. Could use a little more carbonation. Flavor is solid. Caramel malts meld with a hint of breadiness. Hops add a little spice and alcohol adds a little heat. All in all, a solid Impy Red that could us more CO2.;1;1;;1
31;"From a caged corked 750 ml. bottle with a notched freshness date on the back label, taken from my ""cellar"" and allowed to warm a bit, sampled in a tulip glass.		Poured a cloudy amber hued burnt orange with a foamy, bubbly topped off-white head that slowly settled into a thin creamy lacing.		Aromas of coriander and orange peel, a very light spiciness, bubble gum, apricots and peaches, and a sweet maltiness that meshes with the alcohol.		Good, steady carbonation and a crisp, dryish, creamy smooth medium-full bodied mouthfeel.		Good, balanced taste, toasted caramel grainy malts, butter toffee, orange peel, coriander, a nice peach fruitiness, spicy, herbal hops that provide a soft bitterness, the alcohol meshes with the peaches and spices, provides a slow warmth in the palate, and a dry, spicy, toasted grainy finish with the grains lingering a bit in the aftertaste.		An easy, smooth sipper, very enjoyable, pleasant on a chilly spring evening.";1;1;;1
32;This pours almost black. Not too much head and it went away a lot quicker than many other imperial stouts I've had. I can smell a little bit of chocolate/coffee and the roasted malt. The taste has the same, plus a little bit of added booziness. Carbonation was fairly low, so it went down smoothly enough even with the alcohol taste being present.;0;0;;1
33;"Served in straight pint glass at the brewery. Happily the bartender asked if I wanted lemon, instead of just jamming it on the glass. Typical cloudy wheat color and white head.		The aroma and taste were what one expects from this style, just more muted and softer than a lot examples. The body was, again, typical. Drinkability was very good, you could sit and drink these all day. A decent beer worth trying, a pleasant respite from the chaos of Pike Place Market.";0;0;;1
34;"Green capped bottle poured into a snifter on 12/17/09		Pours a dense brown & settles black. A thin, bubbly head dissipates almost instantly. Swirling the glass revives a bit of dark tan foam. Retention is minimal & mainly kept to the inside perimeter of the glass. Sporadic circles of lace toward the beginning, with no left by the end.		The nose isn't as potent as I would expect. It has an effervescent quality upfront. Still, there is a sharp bourbon booziness that is mellowed by the smoothness of oatmeal & oak. Hints of chocolate & roasted malts abound with a notable presence of dark fruits - namely prunes & dark cherries. 		Smooth swaths of oatmeal lead into a solid chocolate middle which is the prevalent flavor here. Roasted malts are in the background; dark sugar undertones. Smooth & earthy notes of wood with notions of bourbon & vanilla. Hints of dark fruits on the finish. Very nice, indeed.		While full bodied & robust, BA B.O.R.I.S. isn't particularly dense or gritty. It actually has quite a bit of slickness to it. Very low carbonation is rather smooth. Alcohol heat is appreciable but isn't too harsh.		On the whole this beer is impressive & I found it to be quite enjoyable. Certainly it's one to be sipped. Worth picking up a bottle when it's around.";1;1;;1
35;Had to travel to Asheville to score this, as Founders is not sold here in SC. And let me say, it was worth the trip. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beautiful jet black with a bold 2 finger tan head that stuck around for a bit with good lacing. Smell is huge coffee, roasted malts, figs, toffee and perhaps some chocolate. Taste follows the nose, but what was surprising was the balance and complex taste. Starts off coffee and then the chocolate hits with the hops and malts. Sweet but bold on the finish and just difficult to put down. Excellent sipping beer on a cold night. Breakfast Stout is the perfect name for this. Feel is thick and creamy with good carbonation. Silky and pleasant on the tongue. Overall- Top notch for the style and my favorite to date. Complex and full with excellet taste and smell. Huge coffee and mocca with perfect balance. Founders knocked this out of the park. Letting another bottle age in the cellar and we will see what happens. A must try;1;1;;1
36;"Clear orangish-red. Extremely fine, bright white head.		Biscuit and caramel dominate over leafy, bright, earthy hops. Nice fresh baked white yeasty bread lurks underneath. Really nice IPA nose. Reminds me of NBB's 2 Below, but on a more composed scale.		Medium in the mouth. Malt dominates initially, with biscuit in control, well-supported by some light caramelly notes. Hops kick in on the mid-palate, with a nice fresh flavor. Good bitterness on the long finish. Some mineral shows at the death adding complexity.		Lowish carbonation allows the malt to really have a run at the palate. There's enough there to scrape clean at the finish. Very drinkable. Nice to have a local, sessionable, hoppy beer like this one. Well done, O'Fallon!";1;0;;0
37;"Enjoying 10 oz pour at Binny's Southloop for $8. 		Pours almost black with a light creamy head. The lacing clings to the glass like glue. 		Smell is somewhat muted, maybe it needs to warm up a little.		Tastes wonderful. Very sweet, nice bourbon, perhaps vanilla, a slight hint of licorice, some roasted malts.		This is a creamy full bodied beer. The carbonation is probably a little lower than I'd expect.		The drinkability is way up there. You'd never guess this is 10.5%. 		Overall an outstanding beer. Hopefully they bottle this sometime in the future.";1;1;;1
38;"I am going to retry this beer and give it another shot, but I would like to say that I had the hardest time finishing this beer. 		Beer served in a hefeweizen glass from a bottle. Beer is dark / black brown. Head is large and steady. Can't tell the carbonation. It looks good, lets keep going.		Smell is overwhelming. Hickory and smoke. VERY STRONG SMELL. I don't have to lift the glass to my face to smell it. Knocks me over. What is this going to taste like? Burnt wood?		I coughed. Seriously, I felt like I was suffocating. Beer is medium bodied. No sweetness I can detect up front, just the smoke in the back.		I feel like I'm exhaling smoke after I swallow. Maybe this is the point. The most dominant flavor is smoke, the second most is smoke, followed closely by the strong aftertaste of smoke. I had to drink another beer to get the smoke flavor out of my mouth.		I'll try the other and maybe this one again since I'm clearly in the minority on this one. SMOKE!";1;0;;0
39;"Bottle courtesy of the ugly duckling a year or so back. Been settling in my fridge for most of that time. Still managed to deposit all sorts of nasty in my glass though.		Spritzy pour, though not much residual head after the first few seconds. Beer is brown with a cherry tone to it. Slightly hazy, even after everything dropped out of suspension. 		Nose is very penetrating. Rich malt, more scotch then bourbon. Anise, rawhide, & a sharp, slightly charred base ale.		Leather & a twiggy bitterness are the most upfront flavors. Licorice, oak, ink, scotch.		Feel is heavy, with decent carbonation, but oh so boozy.		Beer is too overloaded to be enjoyed as more then a novelty.";1;1;;1
40;"It would be fitting for a country that borders the Alps and produces a ton of basketball talent to have a very tall, tall head on its national brand of beer; inconveniently, this is not the case and I am hence robbed of any easy metaphors. Fortunately, it does have a gloriously clean, glinting gold complexion that allows for some alliteration.		Zlatorog has the right smell for a Czech Pilsner but unfortunately it's set at a 3 or 4 when where I really need it to be is at, ideally, at least a 7 or 8. I understand, however, that for a (relatively) mass-produced national brand this is asking too much, especially considering it already offers far more hop presence than is customary for beers of this elk. 		Furthermore, the maltiness it exudes is infinitely cleaner than that of the worst North American (or European) offenders. The clean, unadulterated taste of barley malt (as oppose to corn or rice) makes for a flavour profile that is eternally more appreciable for its honey-like sweetness and soft bready taste. And it's supremely more pure and elegant. 		And it's not without a trace of flowery, earthy hop character! It may be subdued but it's inclusion at all is uncustomary and unexpected; the bitterness it imparts is brittle and faint but for all its temperance it manages to be obtrude that biscuity sweetness and remodels the straw-like dryness of pale malt with a markedly more floral and earthy brand. 		This may taste like an uninspired, watered down pilsner but that is enormously better than most countries' national brands which drink like defiled, adulterated sodas. This is not only superlatively more flavourful and drinkable, but it also earns its brewers, and indeed its country and the people who drink it, an immeasurable amount more of respect.";0;0;;1
41;"L: Very nice black looking beer with a medium sized and thick tan colored head that laces the glass very nicely on the way down.	S: Smells of black malts, coffee aromas, chocolate all balanced very well together.	T: Very much like the aroma it tastes of coffee flavors, chocolate, and hints of black malts that make it bitter yet refreshing. Hints of earthy hops but balanced very well into the beer.	M: Very smooth, refreshing, perfectly carbonated and a very good body to it.	D: Very drinkable stout, this is one of their best beers. All around a very good stout.";1;1;;1
42;"I found this beer to be a rather bland version of a wit. Perhaps the ""dry"" component contributed to the american mass produced undertones.		Appeared well carbonated and smooth. 	Smell was also a typical wit.	Taste was well below what I expected.	Mouthfeel was also weak. 		Very few qualities of this beer linger. It would be an easy beer to cook with without imparting too much beer flavor on the food.";0;0;;1
43;"I was amazed at how much I liked this beer. The style isn't much to my liking, but this may have changed my outlook. 		Poured a nice reddish copper color with a medium tan head. 	It had a spicy malt taste with a hint of fruitiness. The smell was spicy sweet. The alcohol was also in the smell. The maltiness seemed to cover up the strong alcohol flavor that I was expecting. I'm actually looking for more of this . It was quite tasty!			Thanks Tikki!";0;0;;1
44;"On tap at Party Towns ""Founders Tasting"" in Covington, KY on FEB 26,2010.		This review is a from the 1/2 growler fill I took home with me.		This beer pours a murky dark brown with a medium tan, small foamy head. Light lacing is seeing after the head quickly settles leaving a characteristic ""halo"" around the edge of my chalice.		The smell is just fantastic. Big bourbon and thick maple syrup adorn this one. I get light vegetal or Earthy notes with a wallop of oak woodiness in this. Wow...		The taste reflects the nose. Very big and complex, but soothing and velvety all around. The flavor captures your taste buds, but then gently fades in a molasses sweetness and vanilla mix. I get an appealing musty quality, as well, which is likely do to the old ale base. Beyond the woody, bourbon nose, I don't get any hot alcohol bite.		Amazingly creamy or velvety mouthfeel. Low carbonation and slick. Wow, it's hypnotic... Try this one if you get the chance, it's fantastic.";0;0;;1
45;"poured from a 22oz. bottle into a pint glass, thanks to my friend David from Spokane (consumed 2/9/08)		A: Pours a cloudy brown with amber edges, with a minor 1/2-finger tall bubbly white head. Some minor lacing appears, but doesn't stick around too long.		S: Aromas are predominantly roasted malts with some minor spicing to complement it, I do wish a more pronounced hop boutique would make itself known.		T/M: Why? Because this beer is seriously hoppy! Right off the bat, the hops bite your tongue, it's a bruiser! And it's well-crafted too, as a sweetly roasted body balances things out, before the hop bitterness batters the palate again. Some notes of orange & nutmeg spicing are present too, but nowhere near overpowering. Great silky mouthfeel spreads these great flavors throughout as well.		D: This beer was superb, provided your tongue can handle the bruising hops, I highly recommend it.";1;1;;1
46;"Pours a very clear, medium coppey-rust colour. Thick, bone coloured head has decent retention. A minimal spattering of lacing is left behind.		Overwhelming cooked corn and rice aroma. Slight hints of fruit, tobacco and citric hops lurk beneath but are ruined by the predominant odour of vile, overcooked, burnt cereal grains. A feculent raisin/prune aroma develops as the beer warms.		Flavours begin very sweet -- caramel and cereal grains. Malts tasted 'cooked'. Hints of tobacco, chickory, and bittering hops lend an oh-so mildly bitter bite to the finish.		Mouthfeel is fairly full; approaching chewy. Carbonation is very nice -- quite fine and velvety.		Too sticky sweet to be enjoyable. Seems under attenuated. Could be good if it had actually fermented out.";0;0;;1
47;First thing you notice when you lean in for a sniff is that it's kind of skunky. If you can keep your nose close enough long enough, you start to notice a little maltiness and hops peek out of that skunk's ass. Then the skunk high-tails it into the flavor. After a few sips you get used to ol' Mr. Skunk and don't notice him as much and you realize that the commercials are right: it doesn't really taste as bland as most light beers. It's got some definite malt presence with some citrusy notes but it also has that unpleasantness (separate from the skunk) that Heinekin also has, but I can't place it exactly. Basically, I wish it was a light beer so it wouldn't be so damn hard to drink fast because it becomes near undrinkable when it starts to approach anything resembling warm.;0;0;;1
48;"pours dark orange, slight cloudy. lots of bubbly head, fades quick leaving a bit of lacing.		smell was nice - predominantly belgian yeast aroma, with hops and citrus present as well. 		american ipa style shined through in the taste as it was very hoppy, citrusy/piney with a nice bitter aftertaste. really good.		overall i found it very enjoyable/drinkable and would likely purchase this beer again.";1;1;;1
49;maybe rauchbier isn't my style, although i love this brewery's helles lager. deep brownish copper/dirty mahogany in color with just a slight haze. off-white to light tan creamy head and really nice lacing that coats the glass throughout. nose is all smoky bacon which carries through in the flavor. like drinking a smoked ham hock. very dry and crisp. mouthfeel is a bit thin and astringent. obviously, this would be great with barbecue. probably great to cook with and not so much to drink.;1;1;;1
50;"Consumed at brewery on Saturday, November 5th 2011.		Beer is a medium yellow and cloudy. No head.		The only aroma I got was a faint banana smell. Did they ferment this with a Belgian yeast?

54;On tap at the French Laundry's Founders event. 10oz pour into a tulip. Poured an oily black with very little head and dark brown around the rim. The aroma carried with it dark roasted malts, licorice, bourbon, oak and vanilla. The taste was very much licorice-forward, with molasses and raisin notes accompanying mild, bitter chocolatiness. There was some alcohol heat, but it was subdued I'm sure due to the age of the beer (keg was probably coming up on a year old). There was a sweet finish to it. Mouthfeel was thick and creamy with light carbonation. Overall a delicious dark treat which earned its spot in the upper echelon of Founders big beer lineup.;1;1;;1

59;"I rarely drink any locals as they generally arent impressive, but rarely have they been bad. I have had the Jefferson reserve and whatever they called their barrel aged stout before they started using just the Jefferson barrels and both were light in flavor but well balanced beers. I expected more of the same here		This beer pours like an infected bottle, a LOUD pssshhh when I opened it leads to nearly a glass of foam upon a moderate pour. Bottled Jan 2011 it certainly is fresh enough. There is a bit of a sour flavor as well which seems out of place, but barrels can certainly add a bit of that. Normally the beers used in these are strong enough to drown out a bit of the sour oak flavors. The problem is the nose is a touch sour and frankly I think I have a bad beer here. This was going to be an extra but not having had it, I figured Id sample and pick up another for the trade. Im thinking twice about sending this one out. 		Light coca and some powdery sugar are in here. A touch of vanilla and oak round out of the flavors. Roasted bitter flavors as well, but there is an underlying sour note thats really taking away from this. Over carbonated to the extreme makes drinking this undesirable as well. The head looks nice deep brown chocolate milk like with a fairly black body.";0;0;;1
60;Looks lke a very deep oak, amber, orange hue. Lots of bubbles and a sturdy, bread dough head, and lots of lacing, makes this one great looking IPA. Lots of muted pine and hop resin coated malts permeate, but don't overpower the nose. The taste is just as mild, but very good in its relative mildness. Mild pine, flowers, and citrus mix with the malty goodness of this beer. Very smooth and medium bodied Great sessionable beer. Had this one with some sharp cheddar.;1;1;;1
61;Worst beer i've ever tried to review. So where do I start. Oxidised, overly sweet, and it has the flavor of wet cardboard with sugar on top. I couldn't finnish it.

65;"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. I know I've always said I have a disliking for fruit beers, but I just tried a sour ale last night after thinking I didn't like them and loved it, so I became inspired to give something else I think I don't particularly like a shot. We shall see how it goes.		Appears an orangish, peachy red color with a half inch bright white head. Very fine particulate floating around, but only visible when held up to light. Leaves a decent amount of lacing.		Aroma is pretty much pure raspberry. A slight tartness as well. It's pleasant but not really something that makes me scream with joy.		The taste is fair as well. It begins with some tart raspberries, and well it finishes about the same. This is what I don't like about fruit beers. They are not very complex. I certainly give props for the taste in either case, despite it's lack of complexity it is quite good. 		Mouthfeel is medium-light, a little slick. I usually don't have much to complain about in this department unless it's glaring and this is no exception. It certainly works with the style.		Well I am not converted to fruit beers from this, but it's certainly not too bad. One dimensional as I said, but still. If there was a keg of this and I got free beers I could drink quite a few, but then again what does that prove?";0;0;;1
66;Reddish brown colour, mostly clear. Very light brown head that sticks around. Very malty aroma with a moderate hoppiness. Lots of caramel and toffee, nearing the level of a barleywine. There's really not a lot of complexity in the flavour. Malty sweetness with plenty of caramel and toffee. Moderate bitterness with a malty finish. Full bodied, low carbonation. Smooth texture and slightly drying from the grain. This is a really good beer, highly drinkable with plenty of high quality malt and hops. Another winner from Founders.;0;0;;1
67;"A: Pours dark black in my pint glass with a brownish-white head. The head is minimal and dies fast. Moderate carbonation. Some mahogany hues on the sides.		S: Nice porter aromas with some dark chocolate, charred grain, and caramel notes. There is some hints of smokiness too. The chocolate seems most prominent, but is very inviting. Light sweetness in the end. 		T: A bevy of dark flavors here with beautiful dark chocolate flavors, melding with hints of roastiness and smokiness. Finishes with a rich, caramel-toffee sweetness. This is quickly followed in the aftertaste by more dark chocolate and roasted flavors. Not overly roasty like a stout. The flavors in this beer balance out to make this ever-so flavorful. The hops are there to balance it out and maybe add a hint of citrus, but they are definitely not overtaking the beautiful malt flavors. 		M: Nice, medium bodied ale with an overall smooth mouthfeel. Finishes clean. Moderate carbonation really fits the style.		D: This is an exceptional Porter. One of the best Porters I have ever had. Beautiful balance of flavors overall. Unlike some other Porters, this one has a ton of flavor. At the same time, it is extremely drinkable. I'm not sure if I can call this my favorite yet, but it is damn close.";1;1;;1

69;"Had tonight at Asmara in central square. Very cold 330cc bottle served with an unfortunately chilled tall narrow stange glass. Beer pours very reddish brown color with almost no head. Aroma is very faint, but vaguely sweet and adjunct-malty.		The first sip is sharp with carbonation and not much else. The coldness amplifies this. The flavor is also sweet and vaguely malty but there's not much else going on here. It does taste fairly lagery for a stout. I really have no idea how beeradvocate came up with the ""Russian Imperial Stout"" designation. It's all of 5.5% abv -- and has none of the flavor profile.		The bottle says ""Hakim Stout (Dark Beer)"". As a dark beer, like a sweet brown ale, it's merely bad. As a stout, it's quite possibly the worst example of a stout I've ever had.";0;0;;1
70;Pours a reddish brown color with a thin lace of head. Smell is sweet and has a grapefruit aroma. Taste is bitter with grapefruit flavor. The beer goes down smooth, but has a very bitter aftertaste and is slightly sour. This is one exceptional beer. Another great offering from Founders.;1;1;;1
71;"Wow!	I never have been much for the Hefeweizens in general, but this offering from the CBC blew me away. Served in a crystal clear piont glass over lunch, it was nice and dark dark yellow. By the time it reached me much of the head had dispersed but there was still plenty of lacing on the glass. It just looks super tasty!		Smells of honey and yeast and fruit! Tastes crisp and refreshing, even when it's not super cold. 		This is one of my new favorites.";1;1;;1
72;"Served from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.		Appearance: Pours brown with minimal head and highlights.		Smell: Roasted malt, caramel. There is a slight alcohol aroma at the end but not to over powering. There is also toffee and a nice sweetness in the aroma.		Taste: Starts nice and sweet. In the middle there is the flavor of caramel and a nice nuttiness. End with a roasted malt/coffee flavor and some bitterness to balance out the sweetness. There is also a very slight hint of alcohol in the taste.		Mouthfeel: Full mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation.		Drinkability: This is a very flavorful scotch ale. Due to the high ABV I would only drink about 2 of these in a sitting.		This is another fantastic beer from Founders. Keep up the great work.";1;1;;1
73;"Honey gold and clear with a thin layer of lace.		Aroma of honey luden's cough drops, floral hops, mild citrus.		As for flavor, this brew is a bit boring. Malt is very weak...it may be an english variety but it's hard to tell. Floral hops with moderate bitterness get lost in a watery finish. They taste old. Light pepper aftertaste. Underwhelming.

75;"Picked up a bottle at Thirsty's in York, Pa. 	Decanted from a stubby brown 12oz bottle into a snifter cold.	A - A semi-hazed amber w/ speckles of suspended matter. A thin tan head clings to the snifter's sides and sticks as lace there		S - Big scent of a dry hopped IPA - piney and full of herbal hoppiness. A good dash of spice and citric intensity. A very 3 dimensinonal hopped IPA - the smell is fresh.		M - Citrus and herbal hop feel, resinous witha synergy of malt and effervescence.		T - A dry flavor, like that of leaf hops w/ a subtle effect of malt w/ a sweet graininess. The oily hop taste of Centennial is quite an experience on its own. Very tea like with its leafy flavors. I found it to be more enjoyable as it warms. The flavor is bitter, but pleasant which continues w/ a maltier finish.		D - Very tasty IPA, not too bitter. A very good balance til the end. Better than average drinkability for the strength. Very aromatic and balanced in taste. I really enjoyed the aroma as much as the taste. This is an american classic.";1;1;;1
76;"Originally received this bottle in a trade with nflmvp in the summer of '07.		A- black with a cocoa colored thin head. I poured this into my spaten optimator dimpled mug which is pretty wide so that might have caused the head to be hard to build up. Looks syrupy.		S- Coffee comes out pretty dominant in combination with dark bittersweet chocolate. The smell is obviously boozy, the bourbon is unmistakeable.		T- the taste somewhat mirrors the smell. The first thing that hits is a roastiness, then the dark bittersweet chocolate finishing with that coffee bitterness. The aftertaste is mildy woody and slightly tart.		M- quite slick. Not Dark Lord slick, but it's still quite viscous. 		Overall: There are so many big stouts that just taste awful to me. Often they have a soy flavor or way too much licorice or anise, but Founders has found such a great flavor combination in both this beer and their regular breakfast stout. This is one of few big stouts that I can enjoy. It's good all around. It doesn't make me want to a run out and get as much as I can but a real stout lover might really find this a 4.5+.";1;1;;1
77;"Picked this up yesterday, since I'm still hooked on Hefe Weizen's as of late. I was excited for this, as I like Stoudt's other offerings and hadn't tried any of their brews in warm-weather months before. Even though this isn't as good as it's European counterparts, this was a great Hefe and very enjoyable to drink!		 I don't think I've ever seen a beer with as much sediment on the bottom as this one had. Lots of swirling to get it all going, before I topped off my pour. Very cloudy, and a deep goldenrod hue to it as well. The head was reminiscent of the Anchor Summer Ale, in that it reminded me of whipped up egg whites and the consistency of soap suds. The lacing wasn't that strong, but the taste was very authentic and easy going. Full front to back, with a nice mix and balance of bananas and cloves. Easygoing, but never empty, and an aftertaste that subtlely lingered as well. Lots of malt here, but it never gets overpowering and this went down very easily and smoothly!		 This a great session beer, no doubt about it. There isn't any citrues to be found here, as in some of the similar offerings that I've had of late, but it's not to worry about. Stoudt's has another solid beer here and it helps to show that American brewers are closing the gap with the people across the pond when it comes to this style. Wonderfully cloudy, tasty, and certainly worth a try!";1;1;;1
78;"CAN you dig it? I discovered another CAN of beer to try.		""""Hold it down!"" What, is that some sort of defiant gesture to goad me to try? F**k you, doggy! I just had a pitcher of something arrogant enough to call me a bastard and say that I am unworthy. You think that I am scared of you?!? Back to your stinking kennel and stay there!		The nice thing about these macros is their head. I produced a solid two fingers' worth of dense, bone-white head with excellent retention off of the pour. The nose, on the other hand, smelled like liquid death. It smelled like a can of gasoline left out to near its flash point. Fusel alcohol to the max! Oof. The color was another winner. It had a beautiful shade of golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. The mouthfeel reminded me of the last scene in ""What We Do Is Secret"" when Darby Crash realizes that he's gone a bit too far, but there is no turning back from the inevitable. His was a heroin overdose, mine was a stomach-wrenching sensation followed by a strange mellowness and a desire for another hit, I mean, swig. Powerful stuff. This was no playing around, certainly not meant for amateurs, and even I as a seasoned veteran could not wrap my liver around this beast. Avoid, boy! Avoid ... Aaarrrggh.";0;0;;1
79;"Sampled on tap at the Founders taphouse. 		Light strawberry-looking thing. Smells sweet enough to make my nose hair pucker up. 		Yup. Too sweet to drink more than a swallow or two. Cherry, with cheery overtones, backed by some cherry with cherry highlights. My wife asked if this was Founder's ""chick drink"" & the bartender agreed.

84;Had this one chilling in the fridge for a couple few months now--wish I would have had it sooner so I could have bought more while it was around! Poured a very bubble pale golden with a thick white head that stayed pretty frothy awhile. It's got a strong hoppy scent. Whooo, it's got the feel of a pale but the punch of an IPA. A solid hop smack with plenty of citrus notes in it as well. It finishes delightfully dry with plenty of hop bitterness. Definitely a drinkable beer. Another fantastic brew from founders--highly recommend!;1;1;;1
85;"A: Light gold in color. Pours with an active, fizzy bit of white head that has no retention, leaving just the barest of surface coatings. No lacing. 		S: Faint biscuit malts and bread. 		T: Down right nasty. Toast, biscuit, bread corn. Old and musty. A tad sweet.There is a certain very faint, but still noticeable sour flavor. Not the sour of Belgians or lemons. More like the twang of yogurt. Faint, but still unpleasant. 		M: Thin with medium carbonation.		D: A horrible experience of a beer. I've got to admit Euro Pales aren't all that great to begin with and I wasn't expecting much out of Lithuania, but still, this beer still failed to meet my exceedingly low expectations.";0;0;;1
86;"I have no idea what this beer was designed to taste like because the infection was so bad. Bacterium Acetobacter I suspect.

88;"Cashed mountain brown - an imperial brown poured on tap at founders. Poured a dark, hazy mahogany, matching quite well with their bar counter actually. A nice tan head lingered throughout most of the drink leaving some mighty fine lacing.		The nose is filled with cashew oil and roasted malts. It's a pleasant nutty aroma backed by slightly burnt caramel and brown sugar. It reminds me of bananas foster without the banana.		Wow this is some good tasting stuff! It's obvious this ale was aged on cashews forever. I'm getting all kinds of wonderful flavors: toasted marshmallow, carmalized cashew, and butter. It's thick and oily even though you can see through it. I'm kind of caught off guard with how long a swig lingers on my palate. It finishes with some booze warmth and more nuttiness.		I'm very grateful that I got to try this (multiple times haha) and certainly won't soon forget it. It's a bold and viscous brown ale exploding with cashews and alcohol-period.

M - Moderate to strong body, thick and creamy. Also a stronger carbonation profile which tends to lighten up the beer. Finishes sticky/cloying. Some alcohol warmth.		D - Flavors are easy on the palette, able to really take in the complexity. The ABV in this beer is very hidden - sneaky. Not filling but the thickness probably wouldn't lend towards sessioning.";0;0;;1
96;"12 oz bottle served in a chalice (the closest thing I have to a thistle glass)		The beer poured a reddish copper with a half-inch crown of foam that showed little staying power, although this may have been due to pouring too soon after coming out of the frigde. This beer really needs served at slightly chilled, not cold temperatures for the flavors to fully develop.		Smell was slightly sweet and slightly spicy. Faint traces of hops. there was no dectectable alcohol in the nose, which I find unusual in a 8.3% beer.		Taste was simply marvelous, leaning heavily towards carmelized malts and hints of toffee and a very mild fruitiness to round out the flavors. Sweet finish but so much that it gets cloying. Goes down very smooth. and easy. You get a ton of flavor in every sip with this one. Many beers this flavorful seem to deaden the tastebuds after a while, so that each sip is less intense than the last one. That didn't happen with this beer.		Would never guess that it's a 8.3% abv beer from the taste Drinks much easier.		Medium to full bodied with low carbonation. 		A real delight and very much recommended";0;0;;1

98;"Found this one at Blue Dog in Lansdale. Don't come across too many ""Triple IPAs"" (other than 120) very often, so I picked it up. Label claims 12% and 112 IBUs. 		A - Poured into a tulip glass. Gave it a bit of a rougher pour towards the end in an effort to motivate some head formation, which was minimal and happened only after I had put the bottle down. Very interesting. The beer is a dull caramel color, and mine was hazy. Lacing was non-existent.		S - Malt dominated and very sweet - almost like cherries with subtle layers of citrus. Its as pleasant as it is different for an IPA.		T - Whoa. That 12% isn't hiding at all in this one. The sweet alcohol that is detected in the nose comes through up front, and strong. Fruity and toasty at the same time. The hops don't start to make their appearance until mid-way through, and gain strength right through the finish with orange peel and a bit of spice. But the malt doesn't give up so easily, especially as the beer warms. Its a very hard fought battle, and very entertaining for the palate. 		M - Heavy and thick. Resinous syrup with little to no carbonation. 		D - One and done. The only reason I might have more than one would be due to impacted decision making as a result of the high gravity.		I'm glad I tried this one. While not something I'd drink often it was def worth the experience. A solid offering from Founders.";0;0;;1
99;"This beer poured out a dark color with a small tan head and little lacing on the glass. The aroma had some fruits and malts, but the alcohol was very prominent. The taste of this one was too strong and the alcohol too prominent. 		EDIT: I had this one again in a large 25.4oz bottle that had been aged for near 3 years and it was much better. The alcohol was much more subdued and the other flavors came through a little better. The alcohol was still too strong on the palate, but better than before.";0;0;;1
100;"Ok, so heres my first review on here.		A: This looked pretty great coming out of the bottle but no head retention. Beautiful amber that I could just barely see through. Excited for the first sip.		S: Again making me excited, im picking up a lot of sweetness almost like a carmelized red apple. Promising.		T: Right off the bat, Woa. Way hotter than I expected. 8.5 is there and from what Ive read about this I didnt see it coming. Theres a lot going on and am finding my palate fatiguing very quicly.		M: Buh. Ok low carbonation leaves a bit more to be desired. I almost feel like im drinking a bourbon and coke, I dont feel ""beer"" in my mouth.		D: Ok this is probably my fault. Im sitting in the hot sun drinking an 8.5 ABV and its just not happening. My last two sips of this one get too warm and get tossed. Next beer about 2 hours later I decide Im going to take this one down now that its cooled off...same result.		Im glad I tried this one but when Im at my Local Liquor store Ill probably pass it up.

Not exactly a desirable flavor profile off the start. I don't particularly care for the flavor here, but it brings more character to the table than a lot of other lagers I've tried. 		M - Surprisingly low carbonation with a medium body to it.		D - After a few other reviewers said they had conflicting ABV listings I decided to check my bottle, only to find that it doesn't state the ABV anywhere on it.

104;"Quick notes from Tigris Beverage/g.housen Tasting earlier today. 750mL brown glass bottle with an 11.2oz label affixed to it. Strange. JB said this was an absinthe/wormwood beer.		Appearance is hazy pale straw yellow. Nose is really closed up despite the warmer serving temp. Palate is watery and unappealing. Flavors are faintly citrus-y. Weak and very disappointing.";0;0;;1
105;Thought this was a very good Pilsner compared to others I've had. The saaz hop character was a bit more mild, and a combination of sweeter malt and less harsh carbination made this much more pleasant to drink. The combination of less bitter taste and smooth mouthfeel was excellent, making this easy to drink.;1;1;;1
106;"Appearance  This one poured a clear orange in color with some very light brownish tints around the edges. The big, fluffy head looked like a thick cloud and showed good retention.		Smell  The big, deep grain comes out nicely. The hops are very bitter and strong, kind of like an Earl Gray tea or something. The distinctive notes play well together.		Taste  The toasty, biscuity malts are terrific. They mate very well with the English-style bittering hops. The sweetness is very laid back and hardly noticeable. I can pick up something that tastes like unsweetened orange juice.		Mouthfeel  This one is a solid medium-bodied with some big bitterness that ramps up at the finish.		Drinkability  The label is kind of cheesy, but its whats inside that counts. This is a terrific session ale.";0;1;;0
107;"Dark brown bordering burn caramel. Very dark actually. Mocha tan head is full and creamy; than fades quickly leaving a small light lace to say hello. 		Nose is outstanding and hard to quit whiffing. Layers of semi sweet chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toffee, and mollasess. Malt is sweet and in your face. Very nice aromas.		Creamy, feminine and quite tasty. Again semi sweet chocolate with sweet coating toffee/caramel that intermingle quite well. Hints of dark fruits mainly black currant, with a slight roast. Could have benefited from the addition of more hop balance. Still a very solid easily drinkable beer.";1;1;;1
108;"Poured into a lost abbey tulip & shared with Cavery. Big thanks to SPDKilz for providing this to cavery in a recent trade!		A: Pours a deep raspberry with a strawberry foam head. This thing looked like carbonated raspberry puree. Very true to the ingredients and very pretty head that leaves thick, foamy lacing. 		S: Wow, raspberry creamsicle. Thick, natural raspberry with a cream like touch, and a hint of slightly sour yeast. 		T: Pretty much true to the nose, with a raspberry/creamlike mix. One thing I love about this is I get a raspberry seed taste side-by-side with the raspberry flavor, just adding to the natural feel of it. Very sweet, with a perfect amount of raspberry tartness and some cream savory sweetness. The only thing I will say against the taste of this beer is that it's straight forward/simple with little transition, and if I sip too quickly the amount of sweetness and raspberry can get a little overwhelming and even noxious. 		M: Heavy bodied for the style, but paired with refreshing carbonation and some creaminess. Some residue around the mouth, but it just adds to the natural feel of it. The mouthfeel really fits the flavor profile of the beer, which is a good thing, but I do think the thickness and creaminess of it takes away from the refreshing nature I expect from a fruit beer. That's a little personal, though, so I'll keep this at high marks for matching the flavors. 		O: This beer is damn delicious. On deliciousness alone this thing would get an A+. However, I would like to see this beer calmed down just a bit, with a lighter mouthfeel, a little more tartness instead of sweetness and fewer raspberries. Point is, they may have overdone it a bit on the huge raspberry sweetness. Still love it, but to be a truly perfected, A+ beer, this thing will take some tweaking.";0;1;;0
109;"Appearance - Light and clear brownish-golden color. Soapy, white head that doesn't dissipate immediately. Only a little lacing. Nothing exceptional here.		Smell - Light sweet malt. No hint of hoppiness. Once again, unexceptional.		Taste - Rather malty, but not overly sweet. A little sour actually. Only the slightest hint of hoppy bitterness. Taste appears consistant throughout. Finishes somewhat sour.		Mouthfeel -Pretty good. Foamy, not spritzy. Nice and full, for a lager.		Drinkability - Eh. I could take it or leave it. Taste isn't bad, but doesn't set me a runnin'.

110;"Big thanks to Masterski for providing this in trade. 		This beer is much darker than I expected. Deep brown colors with some slight ruby tones. A finger of creamy tan head. Nice retention. Lots of lacing. 		Aroma is a mix of pine hops and some maple or molasses. (Malty). 		Nice beer. Certainly a nice hop presence, but well balanced by a malt backbone with some molasses sweetness. Some brown sugar towards the end that mix with some alcohol flavor. Pine hop flavor at the end. As it warms some vanilla comes out. 		Pretty bold body and thick in your mouth from body and flavor. Warming alcohol. 		Nice to slowly enjoy. 		Nice beer.";1;1;;1
111;Woody, malty aroma has a strong overtone of bourbon - no surprise there! - and a hint of molasses. It pours a luscious clear dark caramel with a decent light tan head that leaves some good lacing.

Overall, delicious and recommended!;1;1;;1
112;"This brew poured a redish, brown with a nice fluffy eggshell colored head. It dissipated pretty slowly and left a nice steady lace around the glass. 		The first aroma on this brew is the nice citrus hops. Its followed by a roasted malt and floral hops smell in the middle of the aroma, and as it finishes on the nose, there is a deep rye and caramel smell that hits you.		This brew is nice and hoppy. Its bitter to start, with a nice floral hops and earthy buds to it as well. As you finish the drink you can get a nice taste of bready sweetness and caramel hops that give this brew a nice complexity. The rye flavor really suddle on this brew, and is almost not there. I did detect some at the end. 		This is a medium bodied brew, with a high carbonation, that just gives this brew a nice cream texture as it goes down. 	M - Medium bodied with high carbonation.		D - Very excellent brew, had great flavor and complexity that was great. The flavors mix well with the high carbonation to give this brew a nice bitter/sweet character. Only set back would be that this brew is more an IPA, then a rye, but im a fan of IPA's and of Founders, so not true points lost.";1;1;;1
113;"Picked up a sole bottle at Lush the other day. Was surprised to see what they had to offer, and realized I had not reviewed this fine brew before. Chilled and killed this evening from my favorite brandy snifter. 		A- Tough job on forming a head. What did develop, a minor quarter finger, was a yellowish tinged cream with huge bubbles forming a zig zag through the cap. Barely lasts five minutes to a flaccid skin and limp collar. 		Deep, deep brown body. Almost as if we took brown food coloring and nearly saturated a glass. Carbonation is hidden for the most part, not much visualization of it. 		S- The oak comes forward more-so than anything else. It has that sweet, earthy aroma. Hints of vanilla characteristic of the style. The bourbon comes forth more so as an antiseptic offering. More alcohol than anything else.		T- An explosion of sweet caramels. Huge malt bomb on the opening. It dies off in a shooting star pattern to reveal the barrel characteristics. Its bourbon sweet without the heat of it melding perfectly with the oak flavors. Woody with vanilla edging. It may have lacked the heat, but as it warms the pure ethanol flavors start to creep from the edges in. It has a extremely dry finish. Very little sweetness to pair it. 		M- Highly medicinal. Disgustingly medicinal, actually. It evolves to a bottle of rubbing alcohol, ethyl style. It has the right amount of carbonation, but the flavors you want to linger do not. Thin, mild body. Its such a disappointment here.		D- The alcohol doesn't burn, but it just tastes awful. Truly, truly, gross fora finish. If I could capture the first moments and let them last I'd find this to be a good beer. Unfortunately, that is not the fact. This 10% tastes more like a 20% or worse. I'm forced to drink it further as I hit the middle of the bottle.";0;0;;1
114;Dull amber-orange. The body of the beer is speckled with particles in suspension. No head to speak of . Just a slight collar that leaves sparse lace. Nose is citrus, orange peel and light biscuit malts. Flavor is sweet over bitter. For a pale ale, I'd call this a cloying sweetness even. Just not appropriate. Hops are minimized in it all. Some dry cedar like tones derived from hops I believe. Body is thick and syrupy. Really not that enjoyable.;0;0;;1
115;"On tap during CBC's 20th anniversary.	Served in a white wine stemmed glass.		Pours a hazy auburn beneath a thin layer of film. No lasting lace to speak of. Unripened notes of citrus including cherry, lemon, and orange peel. Notes of peppercorn and wheat. The initial flavors are promising enough: tart, citrus with bright, berry esters. The sourness quickly fades to a burnt wheat and grain base with odd, unpleasant clove and peppercorn spices. These unpleasant floral spices are tough to describe, but are certainly not flattering. Medium in bodied; a bit filmy, but primarily grain-filled. This one started off so promising and quickly went down hill. A very odd concoction that nearly made me nauseous.";0;0;;1
116;"12oz brown bottle. No freshness date. Pours a seemingly pitch black brew topped with tan foaming head that leaves clinging traces as it settles to its resting lace.		Massive, deep, roasty, spicy, smoky, meaty (bacon/ham), nutty characters in the aroma. Complex as hell.		Medium body, smooth and even on the palate. Dominating smoky backbone laces everything with much complexity, and seeps into the gums and palate with an acrid bite. Brown sugar and molasses sweetness, with sugary candied bing cherries. Subtle spicy suggestions of cinnamon. Smoke character lingers on forever with a sweet undertone that slowly dries away.		Oh yeah! Smoke! No doubt a superior smoked beer offering, and now one of my favorites. This full tasting is a long time coming after a petty 1oz sample had at the GABF in 2004 (thanks Jimbo!). Its no traditional Rauchbier, but it might as well be.";1;1;;1
117;This is one of the most commercial tasting micro-brewed beers I have ever tasted.  This one is a dead ringer for American Budweiser with a more noticeable spicy aroma.  Bud is one of my least favorite beers and this one just did nothing for me.;0;0;;1
118;"Presentation: Poured form a stubby 12 oz brown bottle with a twist off cap into a Duvel tulip. Label is designed to look like an old medicine bottle and no longer says ""Kentucky"" on it. No freshness date. Neck label lists 70 IBU's and 11.2 ABV.		Appearance: Pours with the thinnest of heads, barely full coverage. This dark brown foam dissipates very quickly, leaving a few randomly disbursed islands of foam and a ring around the glass. The beer itself is black and completely opaque; looks like used motor oil. Some sediment in the bottle.		Smell: Strong notes of coffee and roasted barley. Hints of vanilla. Bourbon smell is noticeably absent.		Taste: Strong bitterness upfront, not of hops, but like coffee and dark roasted barley. Slight milky chocolate in the middle. Very boozy in the finish; mild alcohol sweetness with hints of anise.		Mouthfeel: Lower than average carbonation level, perfect for the style. Enough to deliver the flavors of this thick stout, but not too high. Body is very good.		Drinkability: A complex and tasty stout. The bourbon is very hidden in this one, which is fine by me. I enjoy the flavors of oak and bourbon: vanilla, cherry, etc., but not the overly alcoholic taste. This one has a bite in the finish form its higher ABV, but not too bad. I imagine that would fade with time.";1;1;;1
119;"Picked up 2 bottles the other day. Still have one left if anyone is looking to trade for one.		A: Poured a nice amber color. Little white head to it, left pretty quickly.		S: Smelled pretty hoppy. Lots of aromas coming through, floral, pine, some citrus. With 12% alcohol you can get a good sense of how strong this beer can be.		T: Big hopped up beer. Lots of different hop flavors coming out, with a big malt background to this drink. Warming alcohol taste comes on strong toward the end. Still makes you want another taste to figure out all the flavors!		M: It surprised me how smooth this drink was with the higher ABV. Medium body with some carbonation. 		D: There are so many flavors that seem to fight for attention that it almost is to much. The hops were equaled out with malts pretty nicely which made it easier to drink. It was a good beer that I could drink for some special occasions, however I wouldn't see myself drinking every night.";1;1;;1
120;"A: Poured from a bottle into a Hoegaarden pint glass in low altitude Galway, Ireland, on December 8th, 2010. Pours a clear dark gold with a thin head that does not retain well. Moderately appealing. 		Sm: A light fresh scent of malt, barley, maybe a hint of roast? Difficult to discern individual notes with my broken nose. What I can detect is nice. 		Taste: A flat open to a one note body with an off finish. Not well balanced nor well built for a pale ale. I do like the main note of the body, but the rest needs work. 		Mf: Too wet until the finish, which dries it up nicely. But the texture of the finish contrasts sharply with the smoothness of what precedes it. Unpleasant. 		Dr: Won't buy it again, especially at this price.";0;0;;1
121;I love peaches but am not impressed by this beer. It poured out cloudy, yellow-orange with no head or lacing. Smells of not just peach and wheat but also some orange zest.

127;I guess I was hoping for something thicker which wasn't the case here. The brew wasn't bad it just didn't come off as an imperial to me. The head was one that sank but didn't vanish completely which was nice. This beer just needed to be thicker or just a strong ABV for me.;0;0;;1
128;"Courtesy of gratefulbeerhead. Thank you sir!		2010 Vintage		A: Pours coffee black with a thin tan head that dissipates pretty quickly. Some spotty lacing on the sides of the glass.		S: Great nose on this one. Notes of sweet chocolate and buttery bourbon really shine in this one. Coffee, vanilla, and just a little oak also come through. An amazing blend of aromas leads to great complexity on the nose. 		T: Dark roast coffee and dark chocolate come through at the onset of each sip. This transitions to a strong vanilla and bourbon finish, sitting atop distinct hints of earthy oak. The strong bourbon and alcohol in the finish is just a touch overwhelming, but overall the flavor has really nice balance and complexity. A flavor of dark coffee lingers for a long time after each sip. 		M: Very full bodied, thick and chewy. The strong sting of alcohol in the finish brings this score down a bit. 		D: A beautiful beer by any measure. It's a little hot right now, but still very good. It can only get better with age. Cheers to Founders for a great BA Stout. 		I enjoyed this more than the KBS I had on tap at EBF 2010.

129;"12 oz bottle, poured into my tulip glass. Nice deep burnt orange color almost ruby. There is very little carbonation, only a small outer ring of white lace outlines the beer. 	The aroma is very sweet, malty candied apple and big resiny piney hops. There is a bit of alcohol too.	The initial flavor is of sweet candy malt and a big wave of mostly piney hops. The sweetness carries into the middle and fades out with the rush of big hop character in the finish that is not only piney but also contains a subtle spiciness. 	The mouthfeel is full bodied with little carbonation.	The drinkability is suprisingly good. For a 13% hop bomb, this beer is easy to sip and less abrasive than expected. Not my cup of tea as for as DIPA's go but a nice beer.

131;"Part of the OCB Summer Sampler of cans. Heard nothing good about this brewery so this should be interesting. Can reads ""dry-hopped"" and claims to be ""a refreshing lager for those who would like some flavour with their beer."" Here goes!

134;If I'm reading the bottle dating right, this beer is two years old - hard to believe because I bought it at a place with good turnover.

Wow I could smell it coming out of the bottle. Super sweet bread, ginger and clove and herbal mixture with a nice interplay between chocolate and faint vanilla, just remarkable. 		T/MF: Powerful hit of dark cherry coupled with fresh grains, I mean this is one fresh tasting beer and that really does not bother me for a beer of this size mixed with a strong bready finish. Coupled with this is a mellow chocolate undertone that balances out the grainyness of the main body. There is a hop presence here but really only evident with prickles on the tongue. The malt bitterness is much more apparent (as it should be I imagine) on the roof of the mouth. The beer is immediately felt on the tip of the tongue, teasing the sweet receptors on the taste buds. The body is full bodied but not so thick that carbonation cant spread flavor across the pallet, its just very active from the time it hits the tongue through the long and protracted finish.		D: This is a easy drinking beer for its size and style, not refreshing in any sense but it really isn't meant to be I imagine. It is a wonderful complex as well as intense big beer, one that demands your attention if you want to take everything this beer has to offer. A fantastic beer to be sure and a wonderful pick up at 2.50 a bottle.";1;1;;1
139;On pouring, it is slightly darker than other light beers, but the head falls flat quickly. There are no percievable hops in the nose, only that bad-beer smell. It's way too carbonated, and the condition is only made worse because the beer is really thin and watery. Slight bitterness from hops in the finish along with something else that can only be described as a grain related taste. The only reason I'd get this is because Dennis Miller did some ads for them. Otherwise, I'll leave it for those who believe Import = good.;0;0;;1
140;"Appearance: Clear dark copper color, moderate white head, fast fade.		Smell: Cocoa and cherry are very prominent, but doesn't necessarily fit in with the beer very well, artificial smelling.

141;This very good stout is very dark with a dark tan head with some lacing on the glass. This beer has excellant aroma of espresso. This syrup like beer has tastes of coffee, burnt caramel, and bittersweet chocolate. Had it at Sapsuckers in Huntington, NY.;1;1;;1
142;This beer pours out as a light yellow color. The head is white and fizzles away shortly after that pour. The smell is a little skunked but it's nothing too bad to take away from brew. The other aromas are of grass, malts and some hops. The taste is light, it's not very flavorful at all. It's mostly like a basic lager. The mouthfeel is alright with some bubbles to keep this interesting. Overall this is an average brew.;0;0;;1
143;Pours a thick and viscous black. A center glass pour yielded a pretty small head that was one of the darkest I've seen - a light brown to dark tan. Powerful chocolate and coffee scents assault the nose, with the chocolate taking a leading role. The roles reverse in the taste, with roasted coffee flavors up front and a sweet chocolate in the background. Mouthfeel wasn't as full as I expected from the viscous appearance, but still very nice. This is definitely a coffee lover's stout.;1;1;;1
144;"Pours a clear golden color with a fairly thick, white colored head.		Basically smells like a cheap malt liquor. That sickly sweet aroma curdles the stomach and then to top it off there is an overwhelming alcohol presence, this does not bode well.		Wow, the flavor is absolutely horrible. I praise the goodness that is BMC in comparison to this beer. Horribly, cloyingly sweet, with a disgusting husky graininess, that ends with a very hot, alcohol burn.		Just a nasty syrupy texture to the beer, with little to no carbonation. Overall one of the worst beers I've ever had. I hate to do it, but this was a definite drain pour. Too much GOOD beer out there to drink, for me to waste a buzz/calories on this swill.		**** Over a year later (11-23-10). I just threw up in my mouth a little, while thinking about this beer. Whew.";0;0;;1
145;"$1.29 a 500 ml bottle is worth trying. I suspect this is fairly fresh knowing how the Polish beer moves in my neighborhood. Label says 7% abv, not 7.5%.		Clear and bright. A little bit more color than a Euro Pale Lager. Head formation is rather weak, but tons of visible carbonation at work. The thin cap actually does last most of the way to the end. A dash of lace here and there.		Green apple dominates the aroma. I would feel better if this smell was from Ephemere, because I know what this suggests for a Euro lager. Sweet bready maltiness is under that, like a pale bock almost.		Alright, so we're looking at a Euro malt liquor basically. I gather that ""mocne"" translates to ""malt"", seen on other beers too. At 7%, it's even stronger than most malt liquors here. Vodka-like alcohol presence tasted, and it's there on the finish too. Characterless bitterness in the back end, but it keeps the beer from being cloying, which would be a legitimate concern due to the one dimensional malt character. Something sour in the back works against the sweetness as well. DMS detected.		The mouthfeel isn't bad. It's not fizzy. In fact the carbonation is soft enough not to bother. Sufficient body as well. Alcohol doesn't help. It numbs the tongue when I try to taste it for too long. Ends up being kind of heavy. Takes time to knock back the whole bottle.		It's something to drink to get drunk. I can do that with this beer. I'd think I'd rather have Steel Reserve or Labatt Max Ice for that purpose and less money spent. Those beers actually do a good job of minimizing taste and flaws, and they're more drinkable than this. It has more flavor, just not anything worth tasting. I don't feel compelled to have another. I seem to recall Hevelius Kaper being better. Go with that instead.";0;0;;1
146;"Mmmm... beer for breakfast. Love this on a Saturday morning with some biscuits and bear-sausage gravy!		This is a great stout. Near-black color with a fine lacing of tan head on top. Smells like coffee, dark chocolate and a bit of earthy hops. Taste is so good and smooth! Full of the same flavors and a satisfying roastiness. The mouthfeel I feel is a slight bit thin, but overall this is such a great, drinkable beer. I always want two, because there's no way you'd guess it's this strong.";1;1;;1
147;"Tried this as a leadup to Rogue XS Imperial Stout at the Local Taphouse.		Poured a nice cloudy straw colour, slight apricot tinge with humble off-white head. Slightly pale, otherwise nice, of course I do like a good hazy beer.		Nose is very resiny with a long drawn-out bitterness and lots of tart citrus, an orange liqueury kind of character, yeah bitterness is OK but I don't like it. Yeah, I'd say this is OK.		Taste is unpleasant, very tart with a strong vinegar astringency and maybe some slight lemon hints, but nothing particularly leaping out at me. It's a mishmash of infected-style flavours, and has no backbone behind the sourness, just tastes like there wasn't enough malt, and the yeast just sours up everything. Pretty thin, watery mouthfeel backs up my idea that there's just no body here. Pretty bad overall, not good to taste, and not good to drink. Might cleanse my palate, only because it kills my tastebuds.";1;0;;0
148;"Thanks to ralflord for the trade! This was the apparently more 10.5% batch with a different label than that on display.		Pours a solid dark brown (not black) with chestnut highlights. About a finger of khaki head that mellows to a thin foam & leaves a little lacing, but not much. Light action from bubbles, real light. 		The smell -- YOWZA!! Smells great -- actually, I usually get the first indication of flavor from licking the cap, & was struck by significant sweet, caramel malt. Actually, chocolate chip cookies came to mind. The smell transported that and a maple smell, plus the sweet sting of bourbon barrel. One of the best smells I've partook. 		The taste delivers on all those notes, finishing with a strong bourbon taste & alcohol presence. Oh, the caramel, oh the smoky notes, oh! The mouthfeel is rich & full without being overly unctuous. This is such a good idea -- a bourbon barrel-aged wee heavy. I hate to sound like a beentheredonethat, but the BB-aged imperial stouts are more common & leave a thick, heavy impression -- not bad by any stretch, but heavier & requiring more commitment. This imparts all the sweet & woody flavors without the intense viscosity. I'm into it!		Drank one, could drink another.";0;0;;1
149;pours a beautiful light gold. the head is nice but fizzy and dissapates rather quicky... that traditional euro pils skunkiness is there...and at the end it really explodes with a crisp grassy and slighty overdone hop bite.. This isn't bad but it's definately more bitter than most. it takes away from the drinkability...at least for me. Distinctive and thirst quenching but will be too bitter for most palate's. love the color....love the bottles....taste=average.;1;1;;1
150;Bottle with 7 months to go until use by date. Poured clear light gold with a small head which disipated very quickly despite giving the pour plenty of air. Suspect I have smelt my first skunk (we don't have any of that particular animal over here in Australia, other than in some of our beers) - first aroma was unpleasant to say the least. Picked up a little grass under the skunk aroma, but not much else. Felt somewhat watery in the mouth, and the taste was dominated by astringent bitterness. Either I got a particularly badly light affected bottle, or I do not like the Pilsner style. Will be definitely seeking out some pilsners on tap to make sure it is not the latter.;0;0;;1
151;"750 ml bottle, 9.5% abv. Fairly clear mahogany color. Fizzy tan head disappears immediately. Seems to be a good amount of carbonation. 		Nice notes of bourbon and vanilla up front.

Nice smooth vanilla notes round things out. 		Body may be a bit light, carbonation is nice and soft. Alcohol is not as strong as expected. A very well made beer.";1;1;;1
152;"Heavy fogged over bottle brown with a scarlet glow. Big, yellow cigarette stained cap of foam. Resides down slowly to a slim mushroom cap and the lacing is amazing with tons sticky snowflake sheeting.		Solid hoppy aroma of raw, fresh, green, floral hop cones. Leafy with a grapefruit mush and floral sweetness twisted in with airy pine. Tilted towards a pungent edgeyness and floating behind it is a welcome toasty breadyness.		Toasty and hoppy flavors build and place all sorts of fun intricacies within a toasty rye bread caked with torn and tatteredly taken from the vine, hop cones. Great little slips of lightly souring bitterness revealing parched white grapefruit, leafyness abounds, bits of pine tar, and fine tuned dryness carrying into the finish with a caring of character. Subtle grassy spice, mint, and smoked leafyness engages some areas of the finish as it evolves.		Slippery, yet set with a bold rich intensity in a medium body feel with very controlled toasty tones and heavy hop handedness. Fluffy textured with hops, smooth, warm, and toasty. Oh...and damn yummy! Another fine addition to the Founders family. Unbelievably delicious and drinakable. Enjoy.";1;1;;1
153;"Poured into a San Jose Sharks tumbler at around 45 degrees fahrenheit. A nice looking amber/gold hue to the body with some little rising bubbles. An impressive looking two finger width pillowy off-white head has great retention and lacing. The clarity is excellent. I can't imagine improving the look of this beer.		Smells like a nice piney/citrus combination of hops with a rather strong malt backbone of caramel and butterscotch. I smell some juniper bushes in this one too. A little bit of earthiness and some spice on the tail end.		A beautiful caramel begins at the front of my tongue, followed up by some butter rum lifesavers and sweet bready malt. Seems pretty malty, but then the hops liven up the party with a healthy dose of pine, grapefruit, raw bitterness and earth. Finishes clean and peppery, with a slightly alcoholic finish.		Loving the mouthfeel on this beer. It's got a perfect medium consistency with a nice head texture, perfect carbonation, and the right finish.		This is a very balanced IPA, but it's still pretty big and bold. I enjoyed this a lot more than Caldera's Pale Ale. It's not a terribly refreshing IPA, but it was a pleasure to drink, and delivered exactly what I was looking for. Overall, a strong example of the classic American IPA style.";1;1;;1
154;"A marvelous pour of mahogany stained a million times with a creamy, thin-beaded, chocolate milk-hued head. Reduces to a firm film and rings of gooey laces. Quite attractive.		The breakfast stout smells of rich, bittersweet chocolate fondue with a sharp twinge of percolating coffee (Italian roast). Not very strong but intense and lingering even at chilled temps. Warmth brings out a little more roast notes from the barley.		The palate is awash with dutch-processed cocoa, dark bittersweet chocolate, and godiva liqueur. Dark roast coffee notes hits midpalate and fades in finish. Lightly acidic and well integrated. Stout characteristics are light in the attack but come around in an aftertaste of beef fond and grill marks, roasted grain and barrel char. 		Thick mouthfeel. Quite chewy. Wort additions almost completely mask out the 8.3% alcohol.		Note to Dave E.: Send more beer to Central Illinois and come back and see us!";1;1;;1
155;"Beer poured very light amber (not yellow), with medium head that disappated quickly. 		Nose was very unusual to say the least, having more of a wine quality to it than beer.

About a third of the way through the glass, the oaky malts started coming through a little more, lending a little more balance to the beer.		Mouthfeel was not good, way to much carbonation.

156;"Hadst thou thine raspberries, red foaming mist heading fruit berry ras I lie alone, mouthfeel light, tart drinkable non-syrup good.		okay okay A: Looks like a carbonated red wine. The foam is there, and it's pink and it's cool! Maybe a little bit more hazy beer-brown than a Merlot, but the influence is there. This is a beer who's very pour shows you that you're in for something different.		S: All sorts of fun goodness here, and it definitely changes as it warms up. This is a beer that only smells Belgian after an hour or so outside of the refrigerator to me. The raspberries are there, and they're strong, one could even say that they dominate. But there's more to it.		T: Raspberries, tart funky (yeasty) sweetness, not syrupy or cloistering, maybe a little bit over-sweet but it's a drinkable beer. Very little alcohol presence present, at least not for the ABV. This is good stuff.		M: Easy drinking, dangerously so. Nice and carbonated, which gives it a sufficient tingly feeling to accomodate the heavy, heavy sweet fruit. This is the strong beer that I want to take to a barbecue when it's 100 degrees outside - that is, if I don't have to drive home.		O: There has been a lot of hype over this beer. Is it worth the high price tag? My opinion: Yes, but just barely. Maybe not even that. It's a fruit beer that doesn't suck, and a lot of fruit beers do suck, so it has that going for it. And it's as drinkable as you could ask for for a beer approaching 10% abv. But it isn't stellar, it feels like it's missing a little bit of body or substance.";0;0;;1

I wouldn't have guessed it was in there had I not known beforehand. No hop presence, but that's not a big deal. The finish was dry. In fact, it was only sweet at the very first. The coffee bitterness was there throughout. 		Notes: This was quite a disappointment.

A slight herbal twang is present in the aftertaste, camouflaging the expected high ABV, which is rendered almost undetectable.		Medium bodied, this is actually a little lighter than I anticipated, but it still posses a silky smooth quality that makes it an absolute delight.		Overall, I have to say as much as I enjoyed this, I actually prefer the original Breakfast Stout. The bourbon seems to overbear the subtle nuances that are more apparent in the regular variety that make it my personal favorite stout, but this is still certainly a world class beer.

179;"Love Buzz, on tap from cask at the source, in a pint shaker glass. 		When I ordered, the server let me know that this is a ""cask ale"", meaning it's served at a warmer temperature, and with less carbonation.		Looks jet black, to very dark brown at the edges. Nice half inch head of light brown, very fine foam, like silk. 		Aroma is loaded with coffee, balanced with plenty of chocolate maltiness. Not a lot of roastiness, struck me as more of a coffee porter than coffee stout by the nose.		Flavor is spot on, a nice bit of roastiness, some chocolate, caramel, and loads of strong espresso. 		Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, smooth without artificial slickness, nice, fine carbonation, notably bitter coffee finish as opposed to hops bitterness or roast malt bitterness. With good reason it's got Buzz in the name.		Overall this is a real fabulous beer. The server came by later, asked me how the cask beer tasted, I said flat and warm--give me another!!!! 		(Not really flat at all, BTW, lovely carbonation perfectly balanced.)";1;1;;1

T - Diacetyl and metallic taste with some malts and hops in the background but hard to pick out after the diacetyl/metallic bomb.		M - I think the off flavors cause a bit of a tongue biting feel. Someone please give me a sponge to scrub this awful taste out of my mouth.		D - 0 for 2 on O'so beers. I really don't want to try the third one I have in the fridge.

183;I basicly agree with everything Todd said about this beer. Great amber orange color. Smell and taste is sweet and citrusy. I could drink two or three of these easy.

184;"Appearance: This ""Holy Brew of Antioch"" poured quite well leaving a thick head that sustained quite well. Lacing is generous and adheres to both the glass and spiderwebs on the surface. Brew color is a medium amber. Excellent so far...		Smell: There is a sweet spiciness, maybe like green apples, that provides a good portion of the aromatic body. The remainder is bready malt with citrus overtones. Aromatic hops are also detected.		Taste: The friuty malt has a minor hint of hops. Not overbearing presence yet still packs a little punch. There is a buttery hint which is NOT desirable in homebrewing, however is was not opressive in this instance. The slight spice presence was welcomed.		Mouthfeel: Carbonation is low, and there is a slight aftertaste. The flavor sat a little too long on the palate and the flavors were a little crouded. Overall not a stellar performance.		Drinkability: To be honest, I was a little let down by this selection. Being a ""Holy Grail"" fan my hops were high. Is this an excellent choice? Not for new drinkers, but experienced drinkers might enjoy the OVERALL experience of this brew.		Prosit!	Nikki";0;0;;1
185;"Bottle		Palmer's Beverage Center	Columbus, OH		Ruby red and crimson with a thin head and nearly no lace left down the glass.		This beer certainly smells like Christmas. Aromas of spiced fruit cake, a huge amount of cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg make for a big, appropriately holiday, aroma.		The beer's flavor is simply too much...too much cinnamon! There isn't much left here to taste but cinnamon, as it sort of burns and scorches your tongue. I can't help but think of YouTube videos of people trying to swallow spoonfuls of cinnamon as I drink this beer (that is, I try to drink this beer). It's almost undrinkable.		Medium bodied with a ton of carbonation. The incredibly high level of carbonation mixed with the incredibly strong, dominating cinnamon flavor makes this one tough to drink.		I won't have this beer again or recommend this beer to anyone.";0;1;;0
186;Draft. Poured into a Snifter glass. 8oz for $5. Pours a dark mahagony brown color with a light tan wispy head hat collars around the glass. The aroma is rich but light with notes of molasses, brown sugar, nut, vanilla, and slight booze. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. The cashews come out pretty strong in this one and I am a little surprised as I had no idea they would be that strong. After the but flavor comes some dark fruit and molasses notes. Rich flavors. Alcohol warms the throat. Some nice spotty lace.;1;1;;1
187;"Can anyone say Colt 45? I bought this because I had 2 seconds in our groceries beer dept. and thought at a glance that it was a variation of the Ridgeway Brewing Company's ""elf"" series. I was sadly mistaken. It poured a clear gold into the glass with an off white head that disappeared as I put the bottle down. No lacing, but some effervescent bubbling the entire time it's in the glass. The first sniff gives off banana and light clove, and some alcohol. Are there any hops in here? Taste wise, lots of malt sweetness with nothing to balance it. Banana dominates, with the boozy flavor strong in the finish. This beer is light in the mouth, no complex flavors. If you want to get there quick, this is the bus to take.		Overall, I'm unimpressed. It's not a bock, or even a good barley wine. This is alchohol served up in a palatable form.";0;0;;1

It was still there two glasses of water later. I know that that is part of the higher hopping rate at work, but its really not that much hoppier than Old Raspy.

196;"Served at fridge temperature in a pint glass. Left over from our Memorial Day BBQ... let's give this a good, honest go.		Appearance- Pours the lightest imaginable straw yellow... as clear as glass, this supports a two finger snow white head that crackles down to a nice, fat rim. Aside from the head's thickness, it's tinted water. No lacing to speak of.		Smell- Immediately following my cracking the bottlecap, an acrid smell of adjuncts (corn and cereal grain) flew out of the bottle. In the glass, this combines with a cloying sweetness that struggles to add a bready malt profile. 		Taste- Sharp and pungent, the cereal notes collide with an awful mouth wrenching abomination reminiscent of stale hops and corn syrup. The finish is especially horrid.		Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Even though the initial attack is aggressive and even biting, it very quickly eases up and becomes really smooth and soft... remaining so right through the swallow. Unfortunately, this doesn't save the beer from itself. It's a hard one to drink out of a glass, purposefully noticing all of its warts. But on a blistering day, out of the cooler and down the gullet, it certainly has its place.";0;0;;1
197;This one pours a dark dark brown color with a small head that left a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was very strong - chocolates, coffee, and some other stuff that I didn't care much for - still decent and very complex. Not being a fan of the average porter taste, I didn't get too much enjoyment out of this one. I'll give it plenty of credit for being very complex and interesting, but the taste was just not to my liking. It tastes like an imperial stout mixed with a porter mixed with rum(?). The alcohol is present in the taste and has a lot of roastedness in the taste.;0;0;;1

199;I had the rauchbier weizen and was less than impressed. The smoke seemed stale and overpowered the rest of the beer. Here however, the smoke seemed to complement the beer more.

I could see this going well with a nice grilled steak or some fat grilled hamburgers, but I'm not so sure I could handle a lot of it.;1;1;;1

I can't believe these people also made the ESB, Limping Mallard, and Wobbly Bob. Those were excellent. This only needs one description for the aroma: Hold your nose.		T - The flavor is a bit flavorless, consisting of vaguely bitter grassy hop, naked and pale grain. It tastes like a diet IPA. The flavor is not sharp, good or different.		M - IPA. Average, at best. It is fizzy and a bit prickly, which can work well to hammer home 'certain flavors'. Problem is, this is lacking those 'certain flavors.'

205;16.9oz bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a fizzy white head. The aroma is filled with smoke. The taste is much like the aroma with a lot of smoke flavors.

The flavor is once again dominated by diacetyl with the buttered popcorn flavor being complemented by some smoked malt and ham flavors. There is an earthiness in the flavor as well. Alcohol isn't all that noticeable. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with lower end carbonation and not much by way of alcohol warming. I split this bottle with 2 friends and I don't think any of us finished our pours, if that's any indication of drinkability. Really just not very good stuff.

Smell is Muted of firewood smoke smaller than its Marzen sibling (hickory, faint ash, Lea And Perrins Worcestershire sauce, roasted BBQ pit, salty beef jerky quality).

Tastes are surprisingly more muted than its Marzen sibling and subtle, although it feels more salty and has a sugar malt and alcohol heat to it noticeable on its 6.5 ABV.

216;Poured from 12 oz bottle into dimpled mug. It pours a clear, copper-colored body under a small, beige head. Bready nose with some fruity hops, just as expected from a low ABV English old ale. The flavor is much the same, sweet, bready and with dried fruits. Bready finish as well. Dryish mouthfeel, even though it's rather sweet.

217;"I look forward to this brew coming out every September...The time has come in 2010. Wahoo!		A: Pours a thick, black oil that resembles nothing less than liquified coffee grounds. A small trail of bubbles for a head adds to the sight.		S: Coffee, coffee, COFFEE! Did I mention I smell coffee? Not of the Maxwell House variety, but something much, much more enticing. No chocolate, fruit, oatmeal, or anything like that has yet to poke it's sinister head.		T: Strong coffee taste at first, with the coffee spice staining the tongue with taste and just staying there for the duration of the session. The chocolate then makes an appearance, first texturally, then mixed into the coffee bean mayhem. This particular brand of chocolate really reminds me of Scharffen Berger dark chocolate. 		M: Here is where the oatmeal make it's contribution. The texture of the beer is like a slick, slimy chocolate milk, with a little bit of rye-like aftertaste (oatmeal). The carbonation lightly sizzles the tongue. Sure the beer coats, but oh what a damn good coat!		D: As I'm sure the brewers at Founders would agree: This one is a sipper. Not just because the ABV is 8.3% (which I guess is not THAT bad), but because the beer is so flooded with taste, it's best enjoyed by savoring every drop. I'm not a big fan of coffee, but I love it in beer. This is one of the best of the best in that realm.";1;1;;1

Some phenols and spiciness come across okay, there is a peaty, almost ashtray-like smoke on the aftertaste and finish.

221;Once poured from the bottle I felt a little dissapointed. I expected it to be black, hence the name, but it was brown. It was a nice brown with a white head on it that dissapeared quickly.

D - Nice offering, well rounded, a solid mid-gear sip.		Notes: Hmmm, nice quality brew, but it is not half as outstanding as the hype would have one believe.

224;"Pours black with good lacing. Not much more to say here...solid.		This smells of crisp pine and citrus hops alongside chocolate malts fills my nose. 		I enjoy the taste of this one. Mild chocolate malts meet mostly pine hops to create an enjoyable taste. A bit of smoky flavor creeps in adding a small bit of variety. The complexity of this is low, but it is billed as session worthy. I concur. 		The carbonation is low creating a better mouthfeel than if this was carbonation heavy. It adds a feature that differentiates this from a run of the mill brew. The feel is medium though each inch if this beer is broadened to create maximum mouthfeel effect.

There is not a lot of smell to this. Just a bit of grain and some sweet biscuity malt. A pretty typical lager smell with no skunkiness.		Wow is this beer sweet! Not a thick, syrupy sweet, and not a sweetness from ripe fruit, but the kind of sweetness you get when you put too much sugar in your coffee but you drink it anyway. The sugary taste kills off any other flavor that might be in here. I didn't care for it at all.		The mouthfeel is medium and the beer has a rather low to medium carbonation. The finish is more sugar with a bit of alcohol on the way down. For the most part the 8% alcohol is well hidden in the taste but it is definately in there as it sent my head spinning after just one bottle. Between the high sugar and high alcohol I can't see drinking more than 1 bottle of this at a time. I can only hope the other 4 offerings from this brewery are better than this one.";0;0;;1
228;"Pours black midnight black no highlights in this baby. Has a nice chocolate head that doesn't last but leaves a good coating of sheet lace.	 Aroma is lots of coffee mixed with coco one hell of a moca grande some oats or bread like aroma's underneath the coffee.

This is what everyone should be having for breakfast.

230;Very dark copper colored body compared to the other beers from this brewery. Head is still very large, maybe the biggest of the three I have had. Not much to the smell, slightly malty and sweet, but not a whole lot. Taste is actually not bad, despite how metallic this beer tastes. Alcohol is very noticeable, acting negatively to the flavor in this case. OK, but I definitely like the Baro from this unpronouncable brewery better.;0;0;;1
231;"Pours absolutely bottle-brown - like molten liquid glass pouring into the pint glass. It settles in as lightish black, with very little head. 		A good malty stout, but with obvious overtones of the bourbon within - smoothly toasted alcohol.		Said alcohol jumps up in your mouth and lashes your tongue with over-powering bourbon. The stout becomes very much secondary, even tertiary, as the bourbon is big enough to take the first two spots - that's nearly all I'm getting. What else exists back there is lightly toasted, but difficult to find. 		Like woody bourbon in the mouth, with additional carbonation and toasted undertones. 		In terms of overall drinkability, if you enjoy bourbon, you'll love it. Personally, I'm not a fan, which explains my impression of this beer.";0;0;;1
232;Gold in colour with lots of carbonation. Aromas of sweet malt, with a bit of bubblegum and herbal hops. Medim sweet on the palate, with some interesting (if not out of place) spice notes. Theres a bit of a Hallertau note near the end too. The finish is not so clean, but you can tell that there is some German influance to this beer.

Followed up by caramel, molasses, a little oak and smoke, and a faint hint of dark fruits. Bitter coffee roast on the finish, with lingering chocolate and bourbon on the palate. 		Mouthfeel- Full body, ample carbonation, very creamy. ABV's hid very well, literally no burn. Ridiculously smooth! Spot on.		Overall- This beer does not mess around.

243;"Appearence: Pours a semi-clear cloudy yellowish copper with a nice, bleach white head that thins to a collar.		Smell: The smell is a pleasent wheat smell with an odd, medicine like astringency in the back.		Taste and Mouthfeel: The taste is a kinda unimpressive mix of wheat and medicine.

Drinkability and Overall: Wheat beers can be some of the best beers in the world, and this one doesn't stack up compared to other examples. Usually Stoudt's is a very quality brewery, but this one dissapointed.";0;0;;1
244;"This beer surprised me. First of all, because I picked it up en route to grabbing some old favorites and two, because it was so good.

Toasted malt with hints of grain, and the spicy hops from the nose come through beautifully. Nice balance is found in the malt and hop ratio here.

248;"Appearance- Pours jet black with about 3/4 a finger worth of head. Some lacing.		Smell- Intensely smokey/roasted to the point where it's almost overwhelming. Very dark and very rich chocolate similar to devil's foodcake. Strong, black coffee.		Taste- Intense roasted malts that are very rich, strong, and smokey. Sweetness is balanced by coffee bitterness first, followed by hop bitterness. Oatmeal shows up around mid sip but is mostly covered up by the other huge flavors going on. The finish is wood-like and a bit dry.		Mouthfeel- Thick yes, but not as thick as I was expecting based on the smell and taste. Low carbonation level works for this style.		Drinkability/Conclusion- I'm a little surprised that this one ranks as high as it does. That's not to say that this isn't good beer... it is. I just don't think it's ""A-worthy."" The balance for me is a bit off and the coffee too intense. About mid-bottle it hit me that this tastes nearly EXACTLY like one of my homebrews (muck and mire version #2, batch #12). I've still got a bunch of it because I just don't care for it too much. It hits the spot once in a while, but for the most part it's just not what I would normally go for. I like my big stouts to have more residual sweetness, and a little less bitter coffee flavor.";1;0;;0

252;"8/25/2006	$4.00	12 oz.	11.00%	Bottled April 2006. 		Appearance:		Pours a pitch black that lets absolutely no light through. Topped by a quarter or so inch of dark tan that settles rapidly. No legs to speak of, but since this isn't an RIS, that's ok.			Aroma:		Wisps of smoked peat, coffee and a touch of chocolate dominate. I can't detect the notes of vanilla and oak one would expect from something aged in bourbon barrels.			Taste/Mouthfeel:		Excellent smooth mouthfeel, consistent with a milk stout. Nice notes of roasted coffee complete with cream. A touch of smoke in the finish along with mild hop bitterness. Some alcohol is barely detectable in the finish, perhaps imparted by the bourbon barrels? Otherwise I get no impression of bourbon out of this one, which is fine by me, since I don't really care for bourbon.		While this was enjoyable, and quite tasty, I can't get past the price. I paid $4.00 for a single, while the 4 pack was discounted to $15.00. Not worth the price IMHO.";1;1;;1

The toasty malt backing may be strong, but the hops are more than one expects to taste in a Scotch ale, particularly a Wee Heavy.

It does leave out some of the peat flavor some (myself included) like about the style, however. Alcohol is exceptionally well masked.	The body is pretty full, just more than medium perhaps.

It's nice, as a non-coffee drinker this is actually pretty decent. It's pleasant and somewhat rich. The bitterness is perfect, present enough to notice, small enough to appreciate it not getting in the way. The chocolate really blends with the coffee and only offers a generic sweetness. There is a grassy component early in the finish with a nice roasty coffee quality that stats for a while. I really like it when beers have a long finish and this beer delivers. Taste would be a 3.0 if not for the finish.		Mouthfeel: Much lighter than expected but still full bodied. Carbonation is right on with the body, which again is more than I expected but it fits.		Drinkability: I feel like this beer is well tempered but somewhat 1 dimensional. It comes from one direction and offers little texture. It's more or less coffee front to back. That said I still enjoyed it. If this beer were available locally to me I would buy it somewhat regularly. It's tasty, approachable and for a stout rather refreshing.

Doughy malts emerge in the middle and hang around til the finish. 		Mouthfeel: Oily and medium-bodied with a nice prickly carbonation to keep things exciting. Finishes crisp.

Taste: Smooth taste. Slight hint of coffee. Not watered down or overly carbonated. 		Mouthfeel: Swirling it around you really get the coffee taste. Black and bitter, but not gross. Warming on the inside as it goes down. Not quite like bourbon (which I imagine the KBS will be like once I get to try it), but good enough on a winter night.		Drinkability: Very easy drinking beer, but probably too strong both in ABV and bitterness to drink more than one in a sitting. Towards the end of the glass the beer becomes more viscous, almost like syrup. Typically I find a change in consistency towards the end bad, but this was actually a nice way to close out the experience. Price point was good in general, excellent for the quality of beer.";1;1;;1
271;"Just got home from Louisville, with a couple of bottles of this one and got one chilled down enough to drink. The 12 ounce bottle pours a bright and radiant golden hued body with a small, but creamy, offwhite head. Some suspended ""floaties"" are present in the body but eventually settle to the bottom of the glass. Lavish, clingy lacing sticks all over the glass.		Aroma is pungent hops. Mostly citrus, with notes of orange rind, pink grapefruit, pineapple, and apricot. Grassy and pine whiffs are also present, and some alcohol is apparent.		Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, and quite sticky with hop resins. Lots of IBU's are easily sensed, as well as a alcohol presence.		Taste opens with a lot of citrus rind, orange and grapefruit. Leafy and grassy hop bitterness quickly jumps into the fray. A hint of pine abets the array of a massive hops assault. Geeez! This is one hoppy, bitter, DIPA. Alcohol is certainly present, but is covered up pretty well. Some fruity apricot sweetness appears in the middle, but only a vague hint of caramel struggles to balance. Finishes dry and bitter.		This one absolutely fries your taste buds. One of the most massively hoppy ales I've encountered in many months. Similar to Bells HopSlam, maybe better.";1;1;;1
272;"Looks, smells, and tastes like watered down Bud Light. Enough said right???		Pours a sickly watery straw color with a thick boisterous white soapy head that doesn't dissipate and no lacing. Smells like corn and horse piss (like Stella Artois) Tastes really nasty like Corona and death had a baby beer -- like rotten corn and old egg. Mouthfeel is watery and has a heavy carbonation.

274;"Second period beginning, full of munchies, GO CANADA!		This beer pours a slightly hazy faded copper colour, with two fingers of chunky beige head, which renders some spotty lace around the glass as it recedes. It smells of mild bready caramel malt, and weedy hops. The taste is more bittersweet caramel malt, some acrid alcohol edginess, and hollow, weedy, almost skunky hops. The carbonation is moderate, the body kind of thin, and rocky, and finishes mostly dry, but with that unpleasant astringent edge standing out.		Too bad this beer doesn't hold up to Team Canada's play: 2-0 after two periods; but no extra points for this underwhelming Canadian suds offering.";0;0;;1
275;After trying the Sheltowee Hop-a-Lot, I had some incouragement going into this one. The beer turns out somewhat flawed in comparison. As typical Blonde Ales do, the grain-to-malt ratio makes the beer questionable, however the supporting hops (English?) give the beer a slight grassy, pine-ey, and much needed crispness. A big whif of dms (cream corn) comes leaping out of the glass early, but seem to disipate as the I continued to drink. However, the sweet corn flavor never subsided, leaving a moderate hop rate, as the only posative attributes to the beer. Finishes with a grassy bitterness, and that distracting corn flavor.;0;0;;1
276;"This beer poured a rather clear dark ruby red brown with a samll but thick white/tan head.		The nose was simply amazing. Smoke, meat, molases, wood, some slight hints of spice. Basically the best way to describe it is that it smells like a cross between a beefstick and smoked gouda.		The taste is even more interesting. You'd think with the nose it'd knock you over with the meat taste. But... it actually starts off very malty instead. Roasted malt, slight chocolate, dark sugar, molases, and a nice even bitterness. Light carbonation. Medium bodied. Simply a nice even dark beer taste. But then as the beer continues across the tongue the meat and smoke flavors hit you. Meaty and smokey. Just like the nose. Smoked gouda or a beefstick. Very unique.		It ends with a very smooth hop bitterness complimented by the smoked meat flavor.		You either love this beer or hate it. Maybe not the most vegatarian friendly tasting beer. Simply though, it is the best of it's style. A perfect balance of all the flavors, with a nice sepperation too. Almost as you're drinking a fine french bordeaux, but of smoke and malt.	A must try if you like smokey beers.

Pours a clear watery light gold under a one finger white head that fades quickly to collar, managing nevertheless to generate a couple spots of lace. There's not much nose at all - really.

283;Poured into a Michael Jackson snifter back as can be and was really thick. Some head was there at first and was the color of brown sugar. Head reappears if you swirl the glass around and slowly runs back down the inside of the glass. Coffee smell is the first thing that jumps out along with some appetizing roasty and burnt malt smells. Great roast coffee flavor along with a sweetness in the middle of a mocha-ish flavor. There is a light booziness when it warmed up noticeable only in the smell, not taste. Oily mouthfeel and little carbo. Extremely drinkable and complex.;1;1;;1

289;"This is a fantastic double IPA, just about perfect. Not much head on this one, and it disappeared very fast. Did leave a nice lacing on the glass though.

The tastes are initially bitter with some lighter caramel sweetness throughout. Definitely one of the more balanced 2x IPAs I have had recnetly. Finishes fairly bitter and dry despite the sweetness. The body is a little fuller than medium but it actually works pretty damn well.		Really enjoyed this beer and I really haven;t had a bad beer from this brewery.

M: Pretty smooth with a medium level of carbonation. Could be slightly thicker for my preferences, but it's a minor complaint.		One of the many outstanding brews in the Founders stable.

294;"I've been looking for this one for a while now and warriorsoul was kind enough to hook me up with it in a recent trade. Thank you sir!		765 ml cork and caged bottle poured into a nonic.		Pours a deep dark black with a big two finger tan colored head that slowly falls to a creamy layer of foam. A spotty wall of lacing is left on the sides of the glass, very nice. Smell consists of whiskey, vanilla extract, and milk chocolate. Some caramel sweetness and coffee in the nose as well, not as complex as I was expecting, but still good none-the-less. Taste starts off with a warm whiskey flavor followed by fresh roasted coffee and some dark fruits. Midway the toasted oats and chocolate flavors emerge with a touch of butterscotch and oak. Aftertaste has nice combination of some smokey malts and molasses, definitely some complex flavors to this stout. Rich, smooth, and creamy feel with a medium body. Carbonation is low but fits well into the overall profile of the beer. I'm not typically a fan of ""imperializing"" oatmeal stouts, but this beer is damn good.

296;A very generic but very drinkable Hefe. While most others I've had in the past have had at least mild citrus flavors, I did not detect any on this one.

Taste: Over roasted malts couple with some chocolate bitterness and coffee flavor. Oatmeal really comes through too. This RIS doesn't smack your taste buds but it certainly gets there attention.		Mouthfeel: The oats really add silky smooth softness to this brew that I find very enjoyable. Honestly this RIS has one of the better mouthfeels for the style in my humble opinion.

Odor: Subdued, but very pleasant nose of tropical fruit with some waxy, grassy, somewhat piny hints in the background.	Consistency: On the high end of light bodied, though it definitely feels as if there's a bit of meat to this one, the hop oils and carbonation lend a luscious, smooth feel to this beer.	Flavor: Faint, lightly toasted malt flavor and dextrin sweetness in the background, juicy hop flavor in front, perception of bitterness is low and clean. Flavors that come to mind are orange, grapefruit and pine. Bitterness rears up a bit as the hops ride into the finish. 		I like this beer quite a bit.

302;"12 ounce bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Slightly hazy amber with finger or so of foamy off-white head. This reduces to a skim fairly quickly, but does leave scattered streaks of lacing.		Smells a lot like a fresh hot and hoppy barleywine. Sure, there's lot of hops- plentiful citrus, a smaller dose of pine- but a tidal wave of sweet maltiness and booze ensure they aren't showcased. A bit doughy as well.		I remain unconvinced that a ""triple IPA"" is such a great idea. On the positive side, Devil Dancer achieves a searing level of grapefruit bitterness, a burn which is accentuated to some degree by a corresponding burn of alcohol. Very heavyhanded with the malts, though- toffee and caramel from start to finish. Almost a creamy sweetness at times. I'd rate it much higher as a barleywine, which it continues to most closely resemble. Finishes much cleaner than you'd expect from a 12% barleywinish beverage.		Overall impression: Glad I tried it, but I'll take a pass next time.";0;0;;1
303;"Not that this beer is bad per say...just read the rest:		Pours a solid black with little to no head.		The smell is very very strange. Again not bad but very weird.

The taste is smoke backed with roasted malts and a bit of dark fruit. The smoke is not overpowering, but it is clearly the leader here. 		I like the low level of carbonation, I think it adds to the silky flee of the mouth. This is a nice example of a smoked beer. I wish I could buy 6 packs at my local.";1;1;;1
306;"Pours with minimal colorless head and little carbonation into my glass. A very prety dark brown with a tiny bit of red in there somewhere. Whoa- the aroma scares me just a little bit. Smells like that artifical smoke they sometimes add to cheap beef jerkey. Then you taste it and I think I've just snapped into a slim jim; smokiness is the word of the day here; lots and lots of it. I think Jason called the taste like Gouda, someone else said bacon; I really think jerkey and soy sauce. The flavor sticks around for awhile, and I'm not sure I'm happy about it. I really cant detect much in the way of sweetness nor hops. Feels a little thin in the mouth.		So, overall, this was a challenge to taste and a weird one. Not for the faint of heart. This cannot be drunk without food,especially smoky or BBQ foods. It will NOT be for everyone. It does have a flavor that sticks with you and makes you keep taking a few more sips (I guess it's like learning to like blue cheese).

314;"Wow!!! Stoudts....what did you do?!?!? After seeing the previous two reviews, I was being skeptical about opening this bottle conditioned brew which cost $12.00 straight from the Angus Brew Pub. Needless to say, the previous reviews were right. This beer was COMPLETELY undercarbonated thus leaving this brew absolutely undesired!!! Plain & simple, this brew sucked!!! 		But even still, after thoroughly reviewing this beer, I would say that if Stoudt's properly carbonated this beer it would do this beer some justice. In the meantime, this was one of the most awful brews I've had in quite awhile! And...for $12, I wish Stoudt's would reimburse me for actually having to drink this brew. It tasted like the flat homebrew I had sitting in the secondary fermentor for 3-4 weeks.		Fellow BeerAdvocate reviewers...stay away until Stoudt's decides to actually carbonate this beer!!!		Update (10/15/09): After my initial (and only) experience with this beer, I emailed the head brewmaster over at Stoudt's. I voiced my displeasure with the beer. He noted that the yeast had in fact stalled out - hence the lack of carbonation. Later pondering this feedback, upon which I greatly appreciated any feedback whatsoever from the brewery, I came to understand that the beer itself was pretty darn good...now if only it was carbonated it may have blown my socks off like all other Stoudt's beers.";0;0;;1

317;"Pours a beautiful transparent, pale amber with a defined orange hue. 	The head is soapy looking and not too large, leaving a coating layer on the side of my glass. 	The smell is awesome, lively fresh smelling piney hops with some pale malt notes in the background. 	Tastes obviously dry hopped. Fresh pine is fairly forgiving on your tastebuds, coupled with lemon and a very balanced touch of sweet malt. The aftertaste has ample bitterness, and a touch of alcohol that fades quickly.

322;"Presentation: 1 Pint 0.9 fluid ounce [500ml] tall looking brown glass bottle. Labeled as Okocim Mocne with the words Malt Liquor below. Looks just like the bottle in the BA Avatar. Listed as 7.8% by volume, but with no freshness date anywhere that I could see.		Appearance: Classic dark golden body, so typical of many an East European strong lager. Frothy white head that leaves some nice stodgy ring marks on the glass. Conditioning is above average and a gentle swirl aids the head retention. 		Nose: Looks like an East European Strong Lager and it sure smells like one. Grainy malts and alcohol with a much smaller contribution from the hops. Some honey sweetness as it warms up.		Taste: Sweet start, again, just like the nose, the sweetness is honey-like at times. Crisp and clean lines though. Malty body with a decent contribution from the alcohol and a nice effervescent feel from the carbonation. Light bitterness but not much to write home about. Warms a little at times after the swallow.		Mouthfeel: Has a very average mouthfeel which is a real surprise given the strength. Lager-like, the malts dominate the bodys feel with a strong supporting role from the conditioning throughout.		Drinkability: OK, easy enough on the senses, but the Half Litre is enough for me. 		Overall: I wonder if this is what the Polish Dossers drink in the Parks during the colder months.";0;0;;1
323;"Found at Bottle King in Hillsdale, NJ. No freshness date on the label, but this just arrived very recently. Served in an imperial pint glass at just over fridge temperature.		Appearance- Even before popping the cap, there is noticable sediment whirring at the bottom of the bottle. Something about a wet-hopped ale just seems to peak the senses, knowing that there is no substitute for freshness. *Pop* goes the bottlecap, and the result is mystical and surreal. 		First, the head immediately rockets upwards, creating a massive four finger monster of a crown. The brilliant, bright gold beer starts off clear, then after swirling the remaining 2 oz. the hazy, liquid hop drapery begins. There are actually chunks of hops resting at the bottom of the glass... Outstanding.		Smell- Bold, raw hops all over the place... it's green even on the nose. Fortunately, there *is* a sweet, distinctive malt presence to offset the hops. Wow.		Taste- Stick your mouth directly into the boil kettle after administering a dry hopping... then chew said hops. Burps are coming rapidly and aggressively now. The aggressive bitterness takes hold, then defers to malt for balance.		Mouthfeel/Drinkability- It's a bit rugged in the mouth, with the carbonation ripping through the palate... however, considering the depth of flavor and bitterness here, it's appropriate. The sheer pleasure of enjoying a beer *this* fresh with regard to its hopping is enough of a treat, but this one really hits the mark in all categories.";0;0;;1

327;"Notes are a few nights old.		The color is a clear burnished copper that shines a bit brighter orange around the edges. A creamy head formed about one finger high, fading somewhat quickly but leaving spotty thin lacing from what foamy head did stuck around.	This is one of the more pumpkin-forward ales of the style, opting out of the heavy spicing but containing enough of it to make for a good beer. There's a nice buttery crust aroma that gives way to more of a meaty pumpkin smell with notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. There's also a nice malt backing that shouldn't be dismissed.	The taste is what i expect from the aroma, with a strong malt backing lend just enough presence to add character and body without overtaking the pumpkin element. Spices are neither muted nor overbearing, reaching a very nice balance, and lingering underneath is the buttery flavor that makes me think of the crust. It needs all of it to work and it needs it all to balance rather than clashing, and I think that was accomplished here.	The body is fairly thick and moderately smooth, sitting at a solid medium with just enough carbonation and life to it.	This is simply a very good pumpkin ale.";1;1;;1
328;"I can't believe that this stuff made it past the front door of the brewery - its utterly vile.		I'm also appalled that the LCBO would make this a choice as a seasonal beer as it does a huge discredit to other small Ontario brewers and their attempts to establish themselves as making a quality product. I thought that choosing a beer would involve something more than deciding it had a pretty label that would look nice on the shelf.		Pours dark with a short sputtering, soda pop type head. Fierce carbonation and colour make it look pretty much like a cola.		Questionable aroma, very sour to taste. Vague, rough edged hint of maple. Flat out unpleasant and unredeemable.

331;"Solid brew that's more flavorful than their Marzen...but still one of those beers that I can't handle much of.	Pours a dark brown color. Just looking at it, there's not a huge difference between this and a porter or stout, however the head is solid white and doesn't retain the color of the beer.	Smell is very complex. Smoke is the immediate and strongest smell, but you can pick out some maltiness and yeast flavor.	Flavor is solid. Because of the extra malt (I'm making a comparison to the Marzen, which I tried earlier) the body is more in-depth. Initially you'll just be thinking...""I'm drinking BBQ sauce,"" but if you let it linger a little in your mouth, other flavors emerge. Smokiness is still the predominant flavor, but you can taste the beer beneath the smoke. Malty sweetness definfitely helps create a stronger backbone. AS the beer warmed, I was able to pick out oak, cherry, alcohol, and even what I'd describe as worcestershire. Hops are a no-show, but I think it's just because of the overwhealming smokiness.	Mouthfeel actually feels thinner than I'd imagine. I think it's just because with such a bold smokiness, I'd expect something akin to an irish stout.	Drinkability for me is unfortunately low. I like the beer very much, but it's just one of those items I'd like 10oz of, rather than 20oz. It's one of those beers that would make a good one to split at the end of the night, but this is the opposite of a session beer, IMO.";1;1;;1

S: Bread, some caramel, and it seems to have a floral hop aroma. 		T: Mostly caramel and bread for the majority of the taste. There is a floral bitterness in the aftertaste, which is strange because it's not evident at all before that point. It's the beer equivalent of a friend referring to a conversation you never had and insisting that you agreed to loan him $20. 		M: Light-bodied. Medium carbonation. Doesn't really stand out in flavor or texture or anything. A watered-down flavor. 		D: Meh. When I get hard up for cash, I just stop drinking.

337;"1 pint .9 fl oz. bottle with a drawing that depicts the world's oldest Monastery-brewery during one of Germany's many winter snowfalls. If that doesn't say winter just yet, they put snowflakes around the Monastery drawing. On the back label is the US Government warning, US importer, refund values, barcode, Weltenburger's unknown bottling code, and the ingredients. I couldn't help but notice that under the ingredients they list water, malted barley, hops, and hops extract. I thought the hops were going to be enough, but hop extract? Whatever floats your boat.		Appearance: When poured into a Euro style Brooklyn Brewery pint glass, this Weltenburger is a clear dark amber with a touch of mahogany. The head of foam on this beer sucked! It started off with an inch of white bubbles and then it quickly popped away into oblivion. After it popped away, it only left behind 5 white bubbles acting as the rings. There's no way 5 rings could leave any lace. Back to the drawing board Weltenburger.		Smell: The aroma started off bad with the faint aroma of toasted malts, regular hops, and plenty of malted grains like corn. After the beer was swirled around, it was much better than what it was. The malted grains were gone and the sweet aroma of raisins and caramel had emerged. It's about time! It wasn't for those sweet raisins and caramel, this aroma would have been a disaster.		Taste: The taste started off with some lightly toasted malts and then it went forward with a hint of sweet caramel, a sliver of dark fruits, a tiny pinch of spices, and then ended with a mild nondescript hop punch. It was just too hard to tell what kind of hops they were. That hop taste could have been the hop extract.		Mouthfeel: It was somewhere between light and medium bodied with plenty of carbonation and with a crispy aftertaste of toasted malts and those nondescript hops that were in the taste.		Drinkability: This has to be my least favorite beer from Weltenburger. I didn't really care for it. I'm glad I only paid a $1 for it. I still can't figure out what made this a winter beer. I guess it had to be the tiny pinch of spices that were in the taste. One is more than enough for me.";0;0;;1
338;"Pours from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Emerges slightly hazy due to the beer being unfiltered. Bronze golden in color which tells me I am going to enjoy this one.

Slight sweetness immediately, then leaves immediately, with some more bitterness up front and more in the back. Loads of grapefruit with the grass being a little more subdued in flavor as compared to aroma. Bitter but in no way out of balance. Absolutely perfect.

Smell: Modest nose smelling of pale and basic bready malts. Minor notes of caramel and light brown sugar. Slight hint of cherry. To my nose, any hint of peat is imaginary.		Taste: Initial impression of toasted malts with caramel and brown sugar. It lacks depth, however. Peat is more evident in the taste than in the nose. Soft ripe fruitiness exposing a small hint of cherry. Simple, subdued hop character with a minute spiciness and bitterness. Final hints of peat and spice on the drying finish.

Odd mix of fruity and spicy flavors-- pumpkin pie, applejack, dried pears. Quite woody and astringent in the mouth, mixed with that funky sweetness. Then a shuddering bitterness hinting at almond pits.		A true oddity, or maybe a new strain of Belgian beer yeast mixed with Lithuanian rocket fuel.

The taste is where Hell For Certain lost me. While initially exibiting a yeasty malt flavor with some dark fruit notes, it transitioned to a spicy, peppery bite and eventually left a sharp metallic tang on the back of my tongue in the finish. The metallic burn lingered long afterward and was a real detractor. The feel was medium-bodied, with a dry edge.	I felt quite let down by this brew.

Butterscotch, vanilla, and coconut are secondary. Alcohol is noted, and seems somewhat strong. Eh. It's just okay.		The flavor kicks off with a less than satisfying mix of wheat, alcohol, bourbon, and maple syrup. While it is interesting, it doesn't taste very good. It's very convoluted and doesn't come together well at all. The bourbon and maple syrup flavors are definitely at odds. Oak, vanilla, coconut, and light banana are all secondary.

Alcohol is well hidden for 12%, so the fact that the room is starting to spin comes as a surprise. 		M: Bleh, thick and way under carbed.

Strong oak aged flavor, I guess that's the woodsy nose I smelled. Big malty backbone and some bittering hops. I'd say I taste caramel before I do molasses.		Mouthfeel is medium body and leaves a residue. Carbonation is very good for an old ale. Drinkability is really good.		Overall this is a nice oak aged beer. It's good, but I suspect much better once aged. Overall a B/B+";1;0;;0
358;The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale malt scent with some bisquity notes and a mild citrus hop aroma. There is a creamy/bready character to it. The taste is good as well. It has a good hop bite up front along with a balance of pale and bisquit malts. It's quite a hoppy APA. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking pale ale. It's crisp and bitter and very enjoyable.;1;1;;1
359;"Thanks to Vancer for this brew.		Pours a slightly cloudy dark amber red color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger creamy off-white head, lots of nice sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is of malts, hops, nice touch of rye and caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, nice touch of caramel, and slightly bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice rye beer, I think my first.";1;1;;1
360;"A- Pours a crystal clear pale golden color with a large, very short lived, foamy head.		S- A mildly sweet, grapey/grainey maltiness.		T- Very clean.. A grapey/grainey maltiness upfront. Fades to mild earthy, spicy hoppiness. Finishes grassy.		M- Dry, lighter bodied, moderately carbonated.		D- Excellent! Light, clean, refreshing, well balanced.";0;0;;1
361;Tasted old and stale. Some lemon and toffee, with a sticky palate. Pretty boring and void of flavour otherwise. Not good. But will try again on cask or from a fresher bottle, as the one i had may have been sitting on the sshelf for a fair while, which allowed it to get the old stale characters, still, the flavours do not seem like they would be interesting anyway.;0;0;;1
362;Best part of theis wonderful beer is the strong, strong coffee smell. I have some bottles from last year and that part is gone, so drink fresh. Pours black as night. Thick mouth feel, with a bitter coffee taste. This is my favorite of all the coffee beers and I am trying to taste them all, so i have had a few.;0;1;;0
363;"A - clear golden amber. About a 1.5 fingers of white head that lingers quite a while, leaving a fair amount of lace in its wake.		S - Citrus and a floral hop. Really no malt present in the nose, just hops. 		T - Floral and citrus with very little malt to speak of considering the amount of hop bitterness. The bitterness of the hops encompasses the entirety of the finish.		M - Medium bodied, slightly sticky.		Overall: Very solid overall.";1;0;;0
364;"Notes from 6/4/10		Holy head! It is strange to see a light colored beer with white foamy muffin top two finger thick and sustaining head! Nitro is fun. A bit darker than a pale, but the brewery lights aren't doing anything to help me out. Lacing lasts throughout the drink showing notches the whole way. Very nice.		Piney scent, nuances in smell are tough given the bar setting.		There is a constant fight between the hops and caramel malt in the taste. A tug of war in my mouth, but neither side wins (balance is great). The hops are quite grassy with pine and a touch of grapefruit.		The real kicker here is the mouthfeel. It is medium bodied but the nitro makes it feel lighter. This is my first nitro IPA, awesomely smooth.		I could drink this all night and into the morning. Drinks like 3% ABV.";1;1;;1
365;"Imagine you put an additional amount of carbon oxide into your (hopefully someone else's) glass of all-American lager. That will make a Stella.		This is a poor excuse for a beer, almost colorless, with a very weak aroma and practically no taste. Level of carbonation is very high, but beer isn't brewed to compete with soda pop (am I wrong?). Faint bitterness, a hint of malts, some herbs... That's it.		I have not the slightest intention to slam this or any other beer, I just want to warn my fellow beer-lovers: don't spend your hard-earned Lira on it when in Egypt and don't tept yourself to buy it when at home.";0;0;;1
366;"Gudlen Frog 		22 oz bottle into a goblet. 		Pours a clear amber color with a thin layer of fizzy bright-white head. This stays foamy around the edges, leaving just a smattering of light frothy lacing behind. The aroma sits very heavy in the nose, with a lot of sticky sweetness, fruit, some spice, and a still waft of warmth. This is very thick and tangy feeling in the nostrils for sure. 		Once again, this has an almost overbearing sweetness to it that gets to be a bit tough to take after a while. Tons of bread, candied sugars, green apples, and a dash of spicy yeast. With how sweet this is, I'm surprised to find a fairly assertive tingle of spicy hop bitterness in this but it unfortunately does little to balance out the sticky feel of this. The mouthfeel is full and thick in the mouth, with a heavy amount of alcohol beef. 		This one just didn't work for me at all. Just way to sweet and boozy for my tastes, without a whole lot of definition in the flavor to help distract from the body. I split this bomber with a buddy and it was still too much for me.";0;0;;1
367;"Presentation: Friday 9th April, 2004 was spent in Binche, Belgium, the home of Brasserie La Binchoise. Sadly our planned trip to both the Brewery and on-premises Tavern proved fruitless thanks to the fact that it was closed.		After a few beers in the nearby Du Cte De Chez Boule our small party headed into the main square. Here we sampled some brews at La Chamade whilst looking at the many pictures of the Carnival that adorns the walls. La Binchoise Rose des Ramparts was the first and was from the Bottle.		Appearance: Arrived in a clear glass bottle that had been already opened. The Waitress looked at us as if we were out of our minds and wasnt sure if she should leave the Glasses that were on her tray or not. Surely if we knew we ordered this we wouldnt need Glasses right? A group of adults drinking flavored soda-pop fruit beer will need Glasses though? What we go through for a new experience. Darkish cloudy purple color with a little flamingo pink head that fizzes away to a quick death and leaves a flat looking cranberry plum juice offering. Looks Sad.		Nose: Uuargh. Raspberry syrup meets fizzy pale ale. Sickly Framboise-wannabe that is one-dimensional. Enough to make all of our party wary before we even sampled this one.		Taste: Oh my, much worse than the smell  and thats saying something. Raspberry Ripple Ice-Cream meets Billy No Testicles at the Eunuchs Ball. Simply awful. I cannot repeat what my notes say but there are at least two F-words and one that begins with Sh.		Mouthfeel: Sickly sweet and sticky. Raspberry juices mixed into a Soda based Amber Ale. Scrape this one of your cheeks before the next brew.		Drinkability: I finished it, just, there was no way I was going to let the Waitress think that she was right! LOL. Im sure this is very drinkable if you are 12 years old. 		Overall: We should have known from the shocked look of the Waitress that served us the Rose des Remparts that this drink is not for grown Men. Oh how right she was. Shockingly awful. Low grade Alco-Pops are officially now available in Belgium from one of the strangest and least likely sources it seems.		Described by the Brewery as a Raspberry-flavored with very soft taste. This summer session, light and refreshing beer appeals to women and young drinkers. Yep, thats about it!! Its for Jessies and Kids is this one!";0;0;;1
368;"A: This is a very heady pouring beer, filling pretty much the whole glass with foam before starting to subside. It's a whitish-beige form with a pretty smooth top, mostly made of smaller bubbles. It's taking it's sweet time to collapse too. The beer is a little hazy, golden amber with lots of active carbonation. Subsequent pours really show off the great form of this head, I really don't like giving it only a 3.5, but I'm going to stick to that.		S: Very floral citrusy aroma too it, really nice. I suppose that's the benefit of having a big head, lots of aroma being given off. It smells like orange candy almost, or orange blossom water. Just a hint of sweetness. I really dig the smell of this beer. Not overpowering, just very much there.		T: Well, now that the head has subsided to a manageable two fingers, lets taste. Still citrus and floral, less sweet than the aroma. It's free of anything I would consider off or less than good, though the bittering hops come through pretty strong, perhaps sharper than I would like in an APA. As the tongue becomes more used to the bittering it subsides (at least in perception) and the beer becomes more amicable, and the malts, smooth and slightly pastry-like come out a little better.		M: Moves from sharp bitter (influenced by the taste) to smooth, with medium body and good to slightly below good carbonation levels.		D: Very drinkable, a good one to smell, and something I could (and have) had a few of in one night with no complaint.";1;1;;1
369;"Poured from a fresh 2011 bottle. I'll write a quick review, as i've had this many times, and am just surprised i haven't reviewed it yet...		A- Great looking beer. pours super dark black, tiny hints of brown around the edges, but mostly all black. Thick, very dark brown head that leaves an enticing lacing around the rim of the Portsmith snifter.	S- damn, founders knows how to put coffee in a beer. tons of roasted dark coffee and loads of chocolate. 	T- Follows the smell wonderfully, thick malts and deep rich profile.... Loads of super dark chocolate and coffee, damn smooth for the amount of flavor. reminds me of a cool breakfast in November.	M- Not the thickest stout, but definitely not thin. I would personally prefer more body, but i like motor oil beers. could hold onto it's car a little better, too, but these are nit-picky (trying hard to find faults in this guy)	O- Damn work of art, FBS is incredible, especially in the amount they make every single year. Well done founders, thanks for the brew.";1;1;;1
370;"A- pours a deep brown color with some red highlights throughout. a nice off-white head tops this beer and settles slowly to leave some decent lacing on the glass.		S- rich bourbon notes are the main aromas in this beer. oak, toffee and vanillas are all prominant. no alcohol aroma is present as in some bourbon brl aged beers.		T- similar to the nose, but more prominant oak, vanilla and toffee. no alcohol again. very bourbony. 		M/D- full bodied, low carbonation. very smooth and silky mouthfeel makes this beer a treat to drink, especially with the absence of the alcohol.";1;1;;1
371;A classic in which all others of the same style can only imitate but never achieve. Got quite a liking to Pilsner when it was on sale in December for a month at 10.99 a 12er, now its 13.99 and I can't justify spending that much but wish I could. I really like the saaz hop spice.;1;0;;0
372;"Pours a hazy russet color with a thin foamy cap. The aroma is grapefruity hops and a heavy dose of malt sweetness. The same Cascade hop profile shows in the taste, as does the near cloying malt flavor. Apricot flavors emerge in the background, as does an astringent sourish flavor, Im guessing a yeast defect. The mouthfeel is thin and vapidly carbonated. The finish is grapefruity and malty and somewhat soapy.		This is a mediocre beer that I wouldnt recommend. Too many funky flavors mess with the commendable level of hopping for an Ontario brew.";0;0;;1
373;The beer pours a hazy golden color with a lacey white head. The aroma is sweet and fruity. It has banana smells with light crystal malts. The taste is good. It has a slightly malty flavor with a real golden taste. It's clean and fruity. The mouthfeel is good. It's a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent lager, but not great. I think I'll have another.;0;0;;1
374;This beer almost opaque... a touch of red light passes though. Has a quickly dissipating tan head that leaves some traces of lace behind. Aroma is a mixture of coffee, chocolate, and dates. Flavor is quite rich and complex... almost like an imperial stout, but without some of the vinous qualities and a little lower in alcohol. I found chocolate and coffee mixed with dark fruits and a pleasant maltiness. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, and the carbonation is low to medium. A very nice stout.;1;1;;1
375;"Drank on: 2/27/10	12% ABV 112 IBU	12 oz. in pint glass		A= Deep copper colored very opaque brew. Little head dissapaited to leave a skinny halo.		S= Rich thick sweetness, candy-like. Piney hops are noticable along with the alcohol. hints of cherry.		T= Alcohol. Sweet heady carmel flavor. Hop bitterness comes through but the grainy sweetness puts it away almost completely. Almost honey-like sweetness with flavors of tabbacco and leather in the aftertaste.		MF= THICK, coats the mouth completely. Hot, alcohol feeling on the tongue. Slight tingle of CO2 with a light lingering bitterness in the aftertaste.		D= Had trouble drinking all of this one. A little to thick and sweet for me personally. I do actually belive this may be the devil in a bottle.";0;0;;1
376;"A solid pour produces a cresting, almost four-finger thick, rich, creamed chocolate brown colored head in my 25cl tulip glass. The head leaves lots of sticky lacing as it slowly recedes. The beer is just about perfectly black and doesn't pass any light no matter how close I hold it up to my desk lamp. Sharply acidic roast notes mix with a rich cocoa aroma up front. Other aromatic notes of salty smoked peat, burnt toffee, a rich toasted grain base, a concentrated cocoa note and an almost meaty rich malt driven note that I can't quite pinpoint (lots of Maillard browning and an umami effect), but it really boosts the richness of the aroma and provides a substantial foil to the up front burnt acidity. 		Lightly sweet, but significantly rich, towards the middle the roast malt provides an acidity and dry burnt flavor that almost drowns out the malt sweetness, but in the finish the malt sweetness makes a comeback. Ultimately this beer finishes dry as a sharp, softly acid, burnt bitter roast character is what ends up lingering on the palate. Burnt, dark chocolate notes envelope the tongue for a time as the malt sweetness lingers and this beer has a certain velvet-like texture that helps boost the chocolate notes as well. This really is pretty thick and rich (especially for a beer of 6.6% abv), it is quite chewy, though the burnt, acidic, slightly acrid, roast malt definitely cuts through the richness a fair amount. Lingering in the finish is also a significant hop bitterness that couples with the roast bitterness. As the beer warms I begin to notice an almost salty, smoky character to this beer.		Despite being so roast dominated (and by this I mean the sharper, harsher notes), I am really enjoying this beer, there is enough other rich, offsetting / balancing flavors that this beer is just quite enjoyable. Just a fantastic, rich, stout that isn't too strong; in fact it is much richer than its alcohol might suggest and this is actually quite nice.		Purchased: Liquid Solutions";1;1;;1
377;"Got this bottle from Mandy, thank you. I crack the bottle open after it was sitting for about 35 minutes and it blew up on me. I wonder if it is going to effect the review. 		Pour into a pint glass at 46 degrees.		Appearance: The beer has a jet black color. There was a one finger foamy bubbly head that flatten immediately. There is no clarity to the beer. 		Nose: A rich dense smoked aroma, with some roasted malt, it smell like a deep pit barbecue with ribs That deep pit aroma with the meaty smell dominates to where I cant distinguish any other aromas. 		Taste: A rich dense smoke flavor with roasted malt, burnt character, and espresso. There are subtle hints of chocolate and meat. 		Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated. The body of the beer is medium and finish lingers for a long while. This beer is something special, holy cow. This beer taste just like a deep pit barbecue with goat. All I need is some barbecue sauce and I would be set. This beer is way too smokey, there is no balance in the beer. I really couldn't tell if this was a porter or smoked goat. Didn't like it, I poured it down the drain. All the other Smoked porters that I have tried had balance and was rather pleasant.";1;0;;0
378;Medium, cream-colored, dense, ice cream head. Swoops and arcs of lacing. Clear, reddish-amber beer. Nutty, tangy, fruity nose. Caramel front. Grapes, too maybe? Thick, tangy, caramel middle. Loads o'butter. More caramel in the finish with nutty crackers. Quite bitter. This is a nice, nutty, bitter, British session. I could drink it all night.;0;1;;0
379;At first, its chocolatey brown sugar aroma and sticky thick head made me a bit hesitant. I'm not a huge fan of some of the darker brown ales out there (the ones with a very strong nut character). But the cashews add just the right amount of nutty flavor to this otherwise seemingly standard brown ale. One would never guess just by taste that its an imperial either. Its alcohol is very well hidden amongst the rich, sweet flavors. Overall, I'd say Founders is right on the mark with this one.;0;0;;1
380;"12oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip.		A: Clear red-brown with orange hues. Two inch off-white head. Good retention, patchy lacing.		S: Rye, some breadiness, and a whole lot of citric grapefruit notes. Other vague fruit scents in the background.		T: Big rye twang up front is followed by rye bread and some earthy and nutty tastes. Hops are heavy handed, and just as much of an attraction as the rye. Huge hit of bitter citric grapefruit. Maybe some pine thrown in too. Dries just a bit and finishes with tastes of rye and grapefruit. 		M: Medium bodied, very full, and very creamy. A tad slick. Just the right amount of carbonation. Lends crispness and enhances drinkability without becoming sharp and accentuating the rye too much. Very good.		O: An awesome beer. My favorite rye beer on the market so far.		Notes: A very unique and interesting beer. Should be able to create some great food pairings with it.";1;1;;1
381;My glass had a yellowish wheat haze but almost no head. In the mouth it had a stinging fizzyness that I initially felt was from being too cold. I let it sit and the head was gone, and no lace either. It had some lemony ester and tasted ok, but it was overall a weak sister.;0;0;;1
382;"A - Opaque brown body, with a finger of creamy off-white head.	S - Bacon, smoked ham, smoke, ham, 	T - I understand why this beer should be smokey, but I dont understand why this beer should taste like ham. Thats the beginning and end of the flavor for me. There is just too much smoke, no balance as in Stone Smoked Porter or Fujizakura's Rauch. The dunkel weizen character is entirely missing here.	M - Thin light body. 	D - If I wanted some smoked ham, I would fry up a plate. Pass on this over the top, unbalanced beer.";0;0;;1
383;"Ordered a pint at the brewery with a hummus plate, which made a good pairing. But I digress - about the beer: this is not a bad brew at all, just underwhelming. Appearance was as it should be, a nice clear golden amber topped by a thin but persistent head. Citrusy, piney aroma of NW hops dominates the nose, though a hint of malt sweetness gets through. However, the scent is not nearly as powerful as in other doubles or imperials; in fact, some standard IPAs pack more hop aroma than this. And thus it is with the taste - again, pleasing but hardly a stand-out especially if compared with some of the more accomplished examples of the style or even some sigle/standard IPAs. Mouthfeel was OK, perhaps a smidge thin. The only area where this one really measures up as a double/imperial is in the ample 8% ABV. But for that high an ABV I want more intensity, dammit! 		Underwhelming overall, which is all the more damning considering that ales of this style exist to probe beer's hoppiest outer limits.";0;0;;1
384;"Poured on tap at Churchkey into a tumbler.		A white head small as poured but, sitting on a good crystal clear yellow light eighteen carat gold with fast rising carbonation. Very solid lacing of rings with this drink.		Nose is a mild hop and mild soft orange sense with a hint of lemongrass. Interesting mix of soft malts and citrus and grass giving almost lemongrass sense. Wonderfully aromatic.		Taste is interesting. Sour mildly orange and tangerine Christmas bitter orange. Light bodied sense with a very coating palate and this great perfect prickly sense of champagne mimosa like quality. Hop bent just compliments all this citrus angle nicely.		Overall it is like the perfect orange juice hop fresh morning beverage. Fantastic brew!";1;1;;1
385;"Clear golden in color, with a very fluffy white head. Creamy malt aroma with a touch of hops. 	Good balance of sweet malt and hops in the flavor. Finish is crisp and clean. Very easy to drink lager and an excellent example of the Helles - style lager.";1;1;;1
386;"The legendary founders KBS. Never did I think I would find a bottle without trading. Picked it up at my local mix and six for 6.50 a bottle 		A - Fuel black with no head to speak of. Thought it was kind of odd but because of the ABV it seemed right. No bottle date on label or bottle.		S - Right up from the bottle I got oak and coffee but in my tulip glass I can smell coffee and bourbon with more oak. Slight burnt sugars also.		T - Warming bourbon followed by vanilla, oak, then bitter coffee and chocolate finish. 		M - Wow the bourbon packs a less than mild punch than expected! Still very noticeable yet the bitterness of the chocolate and coffee malt take some of the heat off.		D - What to think... Really an amazing brew that I guarantee at least an A in this reviewers opinion. Strong flavor and high ABV with expected high price tag. May have it again if I hit up the brewery.";0;0;;1
387;A hazy cherry red appearance. Creamy but thin off white head. Lacing is quite full and intricate. This aroma's got a nice little cherry aspect to it and some buttery tones as well. The taste is quite subtle. Toffee malt backbone is sufficient. Very slight diactyl. A little fruitiness. Dryness on the finish. And just a little hop bitterness. It has a slick, easy going mouthfeel. Medium body. Decent enough bitter. I'd guess more like a bitter than an ESB though.;0;0;;1
388;Amber colored with a small to medium off-white head. Subtle aroma consisted of a small amount of fruit, caramel malts, and alcohol. The taste was definitely lacking in the....um....taste department. A little watered down and very fizzy on the tongue, which hurt the mouthfeel. Would I want another one of these? Probably not. Although it's not horrid, it's not preferable.;0;0;;1
389;This beer pours a brown color with minimal head and lacing. The aroma is the weirdest that I've noticed - smells like honey hickory smoke barbecue sauce - wonderful aroma. The taste wasn't very good though. It tasted just like it smelled, but for some reason the taste wasn't good at all. Can't say much more, but the taste was terrible.;0;0;;1
390;"Served in a pint glass		Found this beer down at Dobby's down the street from the brew pub itself. This pours a nice really dark brown color, with a serious amount of head on it. To the point it may have too much foam. There is a strong aroma of brown sugar, more than in any other beer that I've ever had the good fortune to sniff. There is a nice almost faint hint of citrus hop in the background of this beer. It's a very sweet chocolate aroma as well. The flavor is fairly chocolaty in nature. The beer is malty and sweet with a nip of citrus in the background. Slight bitterness from the roasted chocolate malts on the sides of the tongue. The mouthfeel is a tad watery for my liking, but the carbonation is spot on for the viscosity, not too bad at all. It is really a pleasant drinking beer, nothing special but a very mild nice porter that is easy going an nice to drink. I recommendation for a run of the mill porter.";1;1;;1
391;I love smoked meats, the smell of smoke. I own a smoker and get grilling quite often. So naturally i thought smoked beer! that sounds great! wrong. Ladies and gentlemen this is the first beer i have ever, EVER! poured down the drain. smelled good though, smoky;0;0;;1
392;"Appearance: This beer has a nice, rich brown color. The head on it is pretty low, with small watery bubbles. There is little to no carbonation.		Smell: This beer has a strange combination of smoked and sweet - the urbock's sweetness is really coming through more than I thought from a smoked beer. Still the nose of smoked cheese is present.		Taste: This is a strange beer on the palette. It seems to really focus a ton of its flavor on alcohol and smoke - even though the ABV is not that high. It is almost a bit curious how this beer can showcase this much alcohol. Still, the flavor seems a little one dimensional - needs more to round it off.		Mouthfeel: This is a very thick beer - like combining a barley wine with flour. Its definately for sipping. One taste does fine to fill up the mouth.		Drinkability: I'm going to say that this is not one I'll often return to. It doesn't work as a session beer, and I don't think that is its aim.";1;1;;1
393;From my notes 6/10/07 Pours a one-finger white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Slight hoppy nose. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Flavor is typical lager/pilsner - hoppy with a bitter and dry finish. S.FR.1.30 ($1.05) for a 330ml green bottle from COOP Vaduz, Liechtenstein. I think the commercial description is saying that the malt and hops are from Liechtenstein, I suspect this is the closest we will get to a beer actually brewed in Liechtenstein.;0;0;;1
394;Pretty god dam awful stuff, sweetish, with a faint hint of hops (you've gotta try hard though), lots of chemical preservative flavours in there aswell, not really good at all.;0;0;;1
395;"A: This is black as night. Viscous as used motor oil. The mocha colored 3 finger head leaves incredible lacing around my pint glass.		S: Roasted malt...strong espresso...bitter chocolate...all there in unity.		T: As the aroma...only stronger. Starts out with a deep espresso bitterness that leads to more bittersweet chocolate notes. The finish is lingering bitter and sweet....in tandem. Perfect!		M: This is so thick and chewy....you feel like you could use a fork. A swirl brings about a huge creaminess to each gulp. Perfect for a big beer as this.		O: All accolades deserved. This is a great beer. Top 5-10 in the world? I'd say so. The flavor is so big and bold...yet balanced. A pleasure to drink.

396;"12 oz. into snifter.		A: Pours reddish brown with minimal head and some lace.		S: Vanilla, caramel, toffee, coffee, alcoholic warmth. Also, there is a pleasant grapey/cognac-y aroma.		T: Tastes very much the way it smells. I'm glad I was sitting down when I took the initial sip. There is an almost overpowering wood taste, followed by alcohol and coffee. A few sips later, I am able to discern other complex flavors, mostly cognac and vanilla. I can't believe this is only 9.2% ABV; it drinks like 12%.		M: Chewy and more carbonated than it looks. It works well for this beer.		D: Rich and hard-hitting. An awesome palate-womper, but one is quite enough.";1;0;;0
397;"Poured into pint glass and this beer looked beautiful. Dark, solid brown color, dense almond color head that stuck around for awhile and left very nice lacing.	The smell was a little nutty and as it warmed, alcohol could be detected. Nothing too strong, just barely there.	The taste was mmm-mmm goodness. This is a quality ale. Although some disagree, I would call this a brown ale as it is labeled on the website. Some use newcastle as the standard brown ale - even though it lacks quality, is flat, watery and is not a good representative for the category. 	Back to the Riggwelter - Fairly heavy on the toasted malts very delicately balanced with a hint of hop. Left a woody taste. I gave it a 4 for mouthfeel because the after taste was a bit washed out. Still, a quality beer. I wish I had another!	Amid all the heavy hop talk nowadays I find it very refreshing to pick up an ale such as this. This is a tasty reminder of warm, inviting malted goodness.";0;1;;0
398;"After cracking open a bottle of this in the Dark Lord '07 line and hooking up about a dozen happy people, I was awfully glad to have reserved a bottle or two of this for a fuller examination... 		Appearance - oily black pour, the head on top is such an intense color of mocha that it looks slighty orange. Some dotty lacing and a head that quite frankly evaporates all too quickly. Generates a partial thin covering only. Other than that though, a great start.		Aroma - intense aromas of coffee, chocolate syrup, and roasted grain, all enhanced by the alcohol. Not as eye-opening as the pour but still good.		Taste - bold charred malts underneath. Lots of dark coffee flavor, burnt at times. Sweetness helps the balance, general at times and dark fruit at others. The swallow brings out some rich chocolate flavors, turning smoky, dry, and a bit bitter on the aftertaste. Alcohol is there and while kept marvelously at bay in the overall profile, it enhances the flavors nicely. The finish is warm, with charcoal and coffee flavors.		Mouthfeel - velvety smooth and coating, under-stated carbonation, right on.		Drinkability - a fine imperial stout and a spiffy value to boot.";1;1;;1
399;On tap at Great Lakes Brew Fest. Pours a deep orange with a medium sized white head. Aroma is medium sweet, light citrus, biscuity and a very faint fruit. Butterscotch is also detected.

401;"From notes 12-13-08		Eye: Not much to look at. Color is a murky brownish copper, kinda like mud...but with a good dose of iron ore in there to give the mud a reddish tint/color.

I've seen beers with much higher alcohol contents that have looked much better. 		Nose: Nice big malt aroma in this brew. Sweet malty notes abound. Some faint oakish and spicy notes are just there, in the back, almost hidden, but still just perceivable. Dark fruits abound, raisins especially. Smells pretty good. 		Tongue: Overall hard character to describe. To me this beer is a whole lot of nothing. I'll just say that it is too watery, too thin and there's just not enough ""barleywineish"" character to it. This doesn't have the barleywine character that makes me want to drink a barleywine. The reason I bought this was to have a beer to sip on all night...sure I'll sip on this but it'll feel like I'm sipping on watered down going flat cola. Hops are pretty green, definitely a floral/herbal character to them. Lots of sweetness in here and not enough bite from hops or from alcohol. To me the actual malt and barley character is just too low key, same with alcohol. Its like this one got such a high gravity from corn sugar or something. It reminds me alot of the way unfermented wort tastes...who doesn't sample the beer after they've taken the starting gravity reading....the more I think of it the more it reminds me of it. This beer is unfinished in my mind, with a real green hop character. I mean, its just like the unfermented wort, not disgusting but definitely unfinished and lacking. No depth, this doesn't do it, or come anyawhere close to doing it for me. 		Feel and Drinkability: Very light on the palate, carbonation is too low. This beer almost feels flat. Now I'd not have a problem with that were the body a bit heavier and if the beer had some pronounced alcohol and a huge malt flavor, but its really just a bunch of sweetness right up front. I won't have a problem drinking the rest of this, but I don't look forward to it. I'll drink it because I have it. But I won't be buying it again.";0;0;;1

404;"Poured from a bottle of the 2008 year vintage into my crystal snifter.		A - A dark chocolate brown with only a small mocha colored head that initially formed before fading away to sit slowly on the top with only a light bit of the head that sticks around on the sides throughout the beer and leaves only minimal lacing.		S - Smells initally was a very strong roasted coffee that really seemed to be the main scent that at first hit me. There are also hints of vanilla, toffee and caramel that waft up and add some sweetness to the brew. There is also a bit of bourbon spiciness that seems to be slightly there amongst the bigger roasted scents and gives you that hint of whiskey that you are expecting to taste. Super, super fragrant also as I can smell it from a ways away.		T - initially, there is a light vanilla taste that seems to dominate this brew before fading into a roasted, toasted coffee taste. There is also a bit of a bittersweet chocolate as well. However this taste does not really dominate as much as it does in the nose. The bourbon really comes through in the end as there is a nice spicy, oaky alcoholic bite that just comes in and says he this is what a year does for yah. Oh i like how the spicy, almost cinnamon notes, stick around in the after taste; it is also nice to have the sweetness in there at the beginning as it makes this one nicely balanced. As this gets warmer, the cinnamon, oaky spiciness comes out even more and becomes more like a nice bourbon. On the whole, it is a very balanced beer and it not the least bit overpowering but instead this beer's balance is what really shines through.		MF- There is really no carbonation at all and have to say that this is one super smooth brew. It is nice and creamy and just rolls over the tongue and comes in to bring the taste to you. The body feels just right and the after feeling in the mouth is a light astringent and alcoholic feeling that leaves you mouth feeling a bit tingly at the end.		D - have to say was really surprised by how drinkable this one really was. The alchy was not at all overpowering and didn't even think of this one as being too much of a sipper either. The smooth body makes it easy to get drink a lot of and the taste are pretty balanced so that you don't feel tired of it or want a change. Pretty happy I could get ahold of some of this and think it would even be better after given a little more age to it though it is already pretty mellow. For a big bourbon stout, it is so drinkable that even my girlfriend found it easy to drink and that is hard to believe since she hates alcohol.";1;1;;1
405;"A pale amber lager. Half finger white head quickly dissipates to a very thin ring. Very mildly carbonated. Leaves fine and intricate lacings inside the glass.

Bready malts with a light toasted character, some honey sweetness, caramel, then the weirdness of plasticy cheese comes into play obscuring the hint of grassy noble hops.

407;"Nearly opaque walnut brown with amber edges. Head dissipates quickly leaving a uniform ring around the glass.		Malt sweetness leads with undercurrents of honey, prunes and a soft tangerine hop scent. However, it's shocking how many specialty grains come through on the nose; chocolate, caramel and biscuit malt all shine through in a department where only one usually makes itself known. A sneakily smoky finish is hampered only by a touch of alcohol, which keeps this one from being perfect.		Mmm, candy! Luscious fruit (raisins) sweetness is carried along by an almost nutty supporting flavor. Roasted bitterness tempers the sweetness and an astonishing hop bitterness finishes the job, leaving only hints of burnt and caramel notes. Oddly, the excellent hop quality cost this a higher score; it tastes awesome, just not right for a wee heavy.		Mouthfeel is coating but not syrupy. Supple with a biting bitterness to sever any lingering thickness. Outstanding in this area. Still, this is a big, flavorful beer with big alcohol to boot. Very drinkable for the style but only suitable for the shortest of sessions.";1;1;;1
408;Exp 02-08-08. Poured pale golden with low carbonation and not much head but a thin ring with a bit of lacing. Mild grassy aroma, soda biscuits.

Nothing in particular distinguished this from other euro lagers but it wasn't a bad example either of a style that has its applications.;0;0;;1
409;"Something new on the shelves from Slovenia. Came in a tall 500 ml black can with a golden oval around the label. Best before date on the bottom of can states 18.05.06, so this still seems pretty fresh.		Pours out a bright clear golden colour, massive creamy white head on the pour that settles to a wafer thin cap and leaves lacing. Some small suspended particles can be spotted, loses points for that, not as appealing anymore. A bit grainy on the nose, faint herbal hops, and very faint veggies. Flavour is difficult to pinpoint at first, one sip it is one thing, the next sip brings something else to the forefront. From what I can tell it has a very husky grain profile, some sort of unpleasant cheap adjunct funk going on in the middle to the tune of cooked veggies, and finishes off with an astringent hoppy note, with a boiled cabbage aftertaste. Hope I'm getting a vegetable allocation for my diet from this. The mouthfeel is fair, not too watery, but a little caustic from carbonation in the middle of the sip, and then it does get a little thin on the finish. Drinkability comes down to how motivated I am to finish the other half of my glass of this stuff. Don't think I'll dump it out, but I'm definitely going to nurse the remainder. Will be passing by this one on the shelves next time.";0;0;;1
410;"This is CPR's cascadian dark ale (CDA), aka black IPA. 	On draught at the CPR, served in a shaker pint, Dark Star is a dark garnet brown with a creamy off-white head leaving nice lace. 		Smell is roasted malts and sour citrus. 		Taste is porterish, but with a sour citrus under-current from the hops, which I only faintly detected on the nose. A little under-hopped compared to most of the other CDAs, but pretty tasty nevertheless. Nice bitterness on the finish has a bit of a minty refreshment to it. 		Mouthfeel is sticky, a bit dry, medium bodied. 		Drinkability is pretty good, a smooth, strong dark ale, well representative of the fairly broad taste spectrum that encompasses the CDA style. I give them bonus points for naming it after the greatest song of all time, even if they inevitably fell flat to that comparison.";1;1;;1
411;Pours an opaque darkness with a huge stiff tan head. A good amount of lacing as the rocky foam drapes and fades. The first mouth full through the beast is creamy and full bodied. Initially you can enjoy a chocolaty aroma from about a foot away from this one. As the head subsides the rye character sneaks out from beneath the cocoa. Full flavored, the taste is quite similar to the nose. A hoppy finish balances the malts out nicely. At 6.6% ABV this one is real nice drinker.

414;"Just poured this IPA 5 minutes ago in the appropriate Founders pint glass. Head is light and slightly amber. Didn't stick around long, maybe because of mismanaged pour. Appearance is clear, makes me wonder what the sediment version might look like. Aroma is not super sticky, not over the top hoppy but very, very pleasant. It's not pungent which I would prefer. First few sips in and it's just as pleasant as I had imagined. Very, very clean with just a little and I mean little bit of the stickiness I find in a lot of other big IPAs. The malt is present but a little downplayed. The beer is full bodied but lean at the same time. I use well-balanced a lot but here again is a well-balanced beer. Not much on the fruity side either. A really straight forward IPA.

415;"Bottle to chalice. God bless Founders.		A: The Centennial IPA has an illustrious coppery-orange hue, medium value and the body is crystal clear. The frothy head is white, average size and lasted long enough for me. Lacing was decent.		S: This beer showcases the Centennial hops and does them a great service. They are particularly clean, very grassy, mixed with some woody pine & spruce, and definitely floral. The malts know their role and back up the hops accordingly providing a caramelly/grainy backbone.		T: The hops and malts make their way to the palate. And what a tasty combination. Centennial very well may be my favorite hop. A peachy pineappley flavor comes through, along with some honey & vanilla. There is a hint of cardboard and some medicinal notes as well. This is such a well balanced brew. And the flavor could not be improved. Perfectly sweet and perfectly bitter. Founders Centennial IPA would be a very useful tool for converting non-craft beer drinkers.		M: The mouthfeel is pretty passive and wasn't much better or worse than average in any department. The body was medium, the texture not thick nor thin and the carbonation was pretty average.		D: Shame on you if you don't already know how fantastic this brew is.

T: The initial flavor was buttered grains, hay, and wet straw. A fairly nice grainy presence but the buttery sweetness and the soapy off flavor distracts and takes away from what could have been a fairly good grain bill.

M: very light, oily and wishy-washy, again with a soapy character to it. Watery lemon hints.		D: Hard to find a reason or justification to finish this.

420;"Pitch black, topped with a wimpy tan mist. The head dies out very quickly, leaving the brew naked. Very dark and oily looking. Attractive, besides the lack of head. Big, big french vanilla coffee aroma. Sweetish, not at all what I expected. I was anticipating something brash, bold and american, and instead I get this velvety little gem wrapped covered in milk chocolate. Silky and creamy. Phenomenal. Strangely, the scent gets a bit dusty/musty as the brew near room temperature, like an old closet. Not bad, it's more reminiscent of inspcting old wooden barrels, sticking your head right in there. The flavor opens with sweet, milk chocolate covered coffee beans, drizzled with a bit of caramel and white chocolate. Lightly carbonated, very, very smooth, allowing the malty sweetness to really come forth. The bourbon aging adds a silken, creamy vanilla note. Creamy and full bodied, but leaves off rather dry. Actually, the vanilla is quite pronounced. A hint of smoke, with lighter, restrained hop bitterness in the finish. Very long finish, managed by bittersweet roastiness and an inexplicable milk chocolate flavor. Alcohol is present, but melds perfectly with the other flavors so as to be part of the experience...and what an experience it is.

425;"Appearance:		Again I found myself reaching for my trusty Belgian tulip and I gave this beer a nice tilted pour and got a nice one inch head that floated on top of the honey orange colored liquid with much grace. As I was coming to the end of the bottle I must have unsettled a little bit of the yeast cake because I got a few floaters in my glass but nothing to get overly excited about. As I gave it a swirl I'm getting medium to high amounts of of lacing which creeps down the sides of the glass slowly. In my usual fashion I held the glass up to the light and noticed that a pretty good amount of light is shining through (almost clear) which really brings out the vibrant gold and orangy colors that this beer has to offer.		Smell:		This beer screams of complexity! Right up front the bourbon hits you while the maple syrup is too far behind it. With undertones of vanilla, oak, and something that reminds me of toasted marshmallows I can't wait to drink this beer. I don't plan to wait any longer so I'm going to dig in right now.		Taste:		Oh man is this a beer or a sweet Manhattan ? As in the nose the bourbon takes the front seat but you don't get bowled over with the typical burn or heat of whiskey. But make no mistake some heat is present but it seems to wrap around the syrup and makes me want to eat some pancakes. As the beer gets warmer I'm getting something like faint cinnamon with fluff marshmallow in the finish which might I add is very long and warming with oaky notes.		Drinkability:		What a great beer to bounce back with after reviewing Dogma, this is really what i needed. Heavy, complex, sticky, and sweet this really hit the spot. While I do love a great bourbon I really enjoy bourbon aged beers. In my opinion barrel aging adds a incomparable layer of depth to just about any beer. In this case where they took maple soaked bourbon barrels and made a solid wheat wine it was a equation for liquid heaven. This beer is very limited so if you can find it I'd be sure to grab it ...hell grab two and see what some age does to this beer. I'd have to say I think this will be a new favorite to add to my list of great beers.";1;1;;1

428;Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. Notched label indicates bottled on date of Decemeber 2007. Appearance is opaque dark reddish brown, fizzy thin finger of light brown head dissipated quickly into a light sticky ring of lacing. Very active carbonation, appearance is not unlike a Pepsi or Coca-cola. Aroma is light, sweet and malty with hints of vanilla and undertones of chocolate, light alcohol scent. Taste is also light, malty with the slightest hint of a bourbon flavor, smoky earthen-grain undertones. Finish is slightly dry with a hint of alcohol flavor. Mouthfeel is watery-thin consistency with the highest levels of carbonation of any brew I've ever drank. Roughs up the palate to the point of practically ruining this beer for me, it washes off the tongue so quickly there is hardly any complexity to the flavor. The scent is also weak and it leaves something to be desired. Drinkability suffers for the latter, makes one want to move on to something else. Maybe this one needs to sit for a year or so to calm down and fall into its own, but as a fresh(er) stout, I expected better. Would not seek out again.;0;0;;1

Retention is great before falling to a moderate cap. Moderate to high lacing.		S - Distinct but restrained coffee in the nose; more like coffee being brewed nearby rather than the common stick-your-nose-in-a-bag-of-beans aroma. Dark chocolate is well represented as well. Small element of roastiness. Not as complex as I would've guessed, but solid and aromatic.		T - Things start off with an amazing balance between mild coffee and dark chocolate. It's very difficult to tell where one begins and the other ends. Some mild to moderate sweetness kicks in with a creaminess that moves the dark chocolate into slight milk chocolate territory. Mid to late palate roastiness begins growing steadily and overriding much of the sweetness. Roastiness peaks late palate and the brew finishes with an acrid, burnt coffee taste with moderate bitterness. The aftertaste literaly reminds me of getting to the bottom of a pot of coffee and ingesting the grounds. Founders Porter would've scored half a point higher if not for the harsh finish/aftertaste.		M - On the light side of full bodied with a rich creaminess. Moderate to low carbonation. Very nice.		D - A great beer all around. I'm not a huge fan of the coffee taste and don't expect to find it in a porter, but despite this it's balanced well. I'm not wild about the aftertaste but overall this is a fine brew.";1;0;;0
432;"Notes from web site: ""Back Yard"" is a golden India Pale Ale. Historically, ale shipped to India in the 19th Century was brewed to higher gravities so that it could mature during the long sea voyage. English brewers also hopped these ales heavily to protect them from spoiling. The term ""India pale Ale"" or ""I.P.A."" is still used by brewers to denote a super-premium, hoppy pale ale style. Backyard IPA is no exception. English pale barley malt is predominant in this beer with just a small amount of crystal malt. It is well bittered with Cluster and Cascade hops and finished with a mix of local hop and larger amounts of Fuggle hop. Original Gravity 1.060 / Final Gravity 1.013 / 6.1% abv.

Deceptive in the way that it shows hardly any carbonation and yet once you take a sip of this your mouth tingles from it. Its a BIG beer. The coffee is intense and also the chocolate and roasted malts, but the only drawback is that the alcohol is noticeable enough to worry me if Ill be able to finish this bomber while Im getting sleepy. As the beer warms up the alcohol seems to overpower in the aroma. The mouthfeel is rich and velvety only a bit too much carbonation. The more I sip it the more I get the alcohol in the taste and aroma which reminds me more and more of liquor, which I find that hard to tolerate now.

Smells sour (not the good kind of sour) it seems all the beers they make are infected, and some sweet malt.		Tastes awful, sour (as usual), mixed spices and thats about it.

Retention is moderate and there is some intricate ivy lacing down the sides. 		S: Damn, this is like sniffing orange juice. Lots of orange pulp that gradually blossoms into grapefruit and tropical aromas. But primarily orange. 		T: Tastes like orange up front, with a stronger variety than sensed in the nose. Grapefruit, apricot, pineapple in the mid-taste. There's a small trickling of biscuit malt that is nearly hidden by a strong grassy flavor. The finish is a moderate rubbery ethanol flavor that reminds me of a badly dry-hopped homebrew (no offense to my homebrewing friends). 		M: Medium-bodied, high carbonation. Pretty cleansing, but it can't erase that rubbery astringency that closes each sip. 		D: Starts off great -- really great -- but finishes badly. I'm mixed about this one.";1;0;;0

441;"Deep, opaque reddish brown pour with a thick, foamy two finger head sitting nicely atop. Thick lacing on the side of the glass. WHOA! Amazingly beautiful grapefruity citrusy hop nose radiates off this brew. A spicy, caramelly background finds its way in there as well. But those hops...man oh man does those hops smell good!		Caramelly, nutty malts hit my tongue first with spicy rye in the mix as well as mixed fruit tones. The grapefruity, citric, floral hops do not miss a beat and bring a healthy dose of bitterness. This is a well balanced brew...with a very nice malt/hop mix. The rye spiciness gives it a nice unique twist. Yum!		Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with a medium body...good medium carbonation. Easy to drink. I wish I had a sixer of this stuff as I could enjoy a few more right now. A damn fine beer....I think more brewers should experiment with rye.

443;"Hmmm... Im confused on two levels. I sampled this beer on tap, on two different occasions, last weekend at Horse Brass Pub in Portland, Oregon. 		First level of confusion: My experience (actually our experience, as there were two of us in total agreement regarding this beer) was nothing like that of the previous reviewer. No taste of iron filings, or anything that might be considered metallic like some English hops/beers. 	Second level of confusion: What makes this an American Malt Liquor? Perhaps this is a subject I am ignorant of. When I think of American Malt Liquor, I think of moderately high-octane macro-swill. Colt 45, Magnum, etc. If theres a whole category of tasty, craft-brewed, American Malt Liquor that I have not been exposed to, then shame on me. 		So, without further Prologue.	 	Appearance: Cloudy, pale amber, with minimal head and lacing. But a disclaimer  Horse Brass is dark.		Aroma: Sweet malt, dark fruit, and very vague whiskey.		Taste: Just like the aroma  sweet and malty, minimal hop balancing, fruity, and the slightest suggestion that this beer had spent time in a whiskey, port, or sherry barrel. Im not saying it was barrel aged, but there was something there		Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied. Sort of soft and slick.		Drinkability: Very smooth and easy to quaff. The only thing that would slow you down here is the desire to savor it, and the 10% ABV.		Conclusion: I would liken this beer more to, say, J.W. Lee's, than to Mickey's Bigmouth.";0;0;;1
444;"Half of this beer was served in a pub glass and the other half from the can. 		Appearance: The beer is the expected fizzy yellow coloration.

Taste: The beers flavor is mostly grain and corn adjunct. Alcohol finishes the flavor the flavors.		Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a thin body and is super carbonated. The beer is not gag inducing but it isnt good. This is an acceptable vehicle to deliver 8% alcohol. This beer should be served cold and from the can. Drink this one fast.";0;0;;1
445;Do they have hops in Poland? After drinking this beer I have my doubts. Full of malt to the point of overbearing. Tasted like a east european macro. Bland yellow color.

446;"A - This beer pours jet black in color. It has a beautiful 2-finger frothy head, that is a perfect milk chocolate color. The head has nice retention, and leaves some nice sticky lacing on the glass. This just looks awesome.		S - This smells of dark roasted malt and lots of chocolate. There are also notes of coffee, caramel, molasses, toffee, a touch of hops, and some booziness.		T - The taste is dark and roasty. There are strong bitter dark-chocolate flavors present. Also, I am getting notes of coffee, molasses, toffee, caramel, some hop bitterness, and some booziness. The finish has a great smooth chocolate flavor, and there is also a hint of booziness throughout. 		M - It has a nice full body and low-medium carbonation. It goes down very smooth, and in my opinion has the perfect body for this style of beer. There is some lingering bitterness, as well as a boozy warmth in the finish.		D - This has excellent drinkability. I have a hard time putting this one down, even though I'm trying to pace myself. This beer looks, smells, and tastes great. I really like this beer, and I will definitely be having more. I highly recommend this. Awesome job Founders. Cheers.";1;1;;1
447;Pours a ink black, with only a sliver of a chocolate head evident. Minimal lacing on my CBS snifter. Truly one of the darkest looking beers I've seen. The nose is mainly coffee, bitter chocolate, malt, and that's really about it. Not quite as good as Breakfast Stout's nose. The taste is... interesting. Not sure whether I love it or hate it. There are a bunch of malts, anise, burned biscuit, coffee, and some hops. After half a bottle... I don't think I'm a fan. The taste just doesn't taste.... well... good. None of the 10.5% ABV is evident. Feel is smooth, creamy, and goes down like butter. The feel is definitely the best part of this brew for me. Overall, I have to say- I'm not a fan of the taste of this beer. I probably will gift the other three bottles away to friends. This is like a Breakfast Stout gone awry... and I love just about everything Founders does. I won't buy this again though. Cheers.;1;1;;1
448;"I was very excited when I saw that the Chumley's in Broadripple, IN had a rotating tap of Founders seasonal. However, when I heard it was Dirty Bastard, I was a bit disappointed. I bought a six-pack once, right after I got into craft, and I didn't think it was that great. I decided to give it another chance, though. I've never had a draft Founders, so what the hell, right?		Served in a chalice/oversized wine glass.		A: Very little head. The body looks just like a cider: thick, rich, brownish-orange. The color reminds of a caramel apple, actually. It churns in the glass menacingly, even minutes after it has been poured.		S: Smells a bit like a caramel apple, too. Sweet and sticky, with hints of raisins and cinnamon.		T: Very boozy. Wow, this is completely different on-tap. The alcohol is intoxicating: woody bourbon that kicks your ass with every sip. Some cider elements that were evident in the nose come full force, adding caramel/toffee sweetness across the palate. This is definitely a man's drink, showcasing an intensely heavy, aged taste that will put hair on your chest.		M: Perfect feel for the style. A hidden carb contrasts very nicely with the slow burn of the whiskey.		O: There is certainly a good and bad way to sample this beer. In the bottle, you'll find a funny-tasting dark ale; on-tap, you will get a brew that yells at you in a crazy Scottish accent, picks a fight with your senses, then pummels you to the ground. In other words, it's just what you expect from Founders: bold flavor.";0;1;;0
449;"A- Amber color with a large off white head. Head is sticky and fades to a cap that leaves good lacing on the glass.		S- Hops, hops and more hops, an overload of pine and grapefruit. There is a sweet smell going on in the background as well.		T- Bitter wash of the hops takes over from beginning to the end. Nothing to balance this out just overwhelming bitterness. Finish is bone dry and astringent. 		M- Medium bodied and lightly carbonated, has that oily hop aftertaste as well.		D- Nope, the bitterness is overkill. Almost wish I could taste the alcohol in the 8.2% ABV for something to offset the hops		Painful - it lives up to the ""mean"" part in the name.

450;"Got this from JohnQVegas a while back... I actually drank 3 of these and forgot all about this 4th bottle tucked in my fridge. Just saw it and thought it would make a nice departure from all the IPAs I've been digging into lately. Thanks Dustin!	Served into a snifter after allowing it to warm for 15 minutes from fridge temps.		Pours up a deep brownish black with some red hues along the edges and in the legs. The tan head started as 2 fingers and settled into a tight cap of lazy bubbles... leaving behind some spotty chunks of lace.		Smells of coffee, bitter cocoa, smoke, a little earthiness (I'm guessing from the smoke?), and some fruit notes-- dark, ripened fruits. The taste has much of these notes from the smell-- some sweetness that reminds me of caramel and brown sugar gives way to a dry smokiness with hints of the dark fruits at the finish.		Body is pretty full. This is a nice thick porter-- one of those beers that blurs the line between stout and porter-- and does so in a great way. This is very easy to drink-- enjoyable, complex enough to keep me interested, and a crazy 9%!! I must say that this beer scores a little extra due to the high ABV. There isn't a trace of booziness in here. Perhaps if this warmed all the way to room temperature, I could pick it up... but in the 15 minutes I have sat enjoying this, there remains a well-balanced brew that hides its ABV well.";1;1;;1
451;"Appearance: pours a nice orange color with a 2"" head that hangs around a while. Some spotty lacing develops.		Smell: a strange bitter citrus and grass odor is a bit unpleasant.		Taste: very sweet malt profile and the hop bitterness seems fake. Grapefruit and orange citrus tones are present. A light metallic finish too. 		Mouthfeel: crisp from start to finish. Medium bodied. The fake bitterness flavor glues itself to your tongue well into the aftertaste. 		Drinkability: not for me. The flavor profile is too sweet and just unbalanced for an IPA. The hop bitterness is just plain strange. Find another IPA on the shelf.";1;1;;1
452;"2005 vintage. 10% abv. The Founders Imperial Stout pours from the stubby 12oz bottle a thick, syrupy charcoal black into my tulip glass with a small dark tan head that falls to a ring around the glass. Spotty lacing left on the glass. Good deal! Aromas of dark vinous chocolate, raisins, big roasty sweetness and some caramel. Subtle burnt coffee and dark fruits. 		First sip brings a dense dark roasty maltiness that weighs down the tongue. A big mix of vinous and milk chocolate flavors collide along with some mellow coffee flavors. Rich and a bit smoky with dark fruits throughout. Finishes with a touch of hops and a lingering burnt flavor. A tasty impy stout.		Mouthfeel is big, thick and a touch syrupy. Really mellow carbonation on this one works quite nicely. Goes down smooth with no trace of alcohol. I could sit down to a couple bottles and have a good evening. Yet another tasty stout from the guys up in Michigan. Keep 'em coming!";1;1;;1
453;I've had like a million samples of this one when all is said and done. Quite a few at the source, and quite a few at some BA fests in Boston. This is a pretty nice brew. Dark ruddy, rusty, reddish brown with a small khaki head that leaves nice lacing. Aromas are all Sweet spicy Belgian yeast funk mixed in with the wonderful old ale flavors of a Hardys or a Lees.

454;"An orange color with tinges of red. Slight haze. Even with a rough pour this didn't leave much head. Some lacing stuck to the sides of the glass. 		Smelled of heavy caramel malts with light cherries and not a whole lot else. 		The flavor is slightly sour and plenty sweet, with the cherry flavor dominating the caramel malt background. Little else is really detectable. Lacks complexity but is fairly nice.		Feels slick, slightly coating and leaves a sweet fruity aftertaste. Medium bodied and not very carbonated. 		Drinks low for a fruit beer. Would make a nice after dinner dessert beer, but I'd prefer to split a bottle rather than drink it all to myself.";1;1;;1
455;"Pours a mildly cloudy russet color with a loose 1/4"" cream colored head. Moderate but attractive lace.		Smells like crayons and Halls cherry cough drops to be perfectly honest. After a few brisk swirls, I swear I can smell chocolate Oreo cookies.		The flavor of bright cherry syrup hits me abruptly at first, and then quickly dissipates enough for the dark wheat malts to show through. There's a nice earthy grittiness in the wheat malt flavors that bring some dryness to the table also. 		Mouthfeel is lively with a good amount of carbonation typical of a wheat beer. Light-Medium bodies with a long chalky finish.		Drinkability is very much below average. Its one and done for me (I actually didn't finish the 12 oz. bottle).		Overall a very disconnected beer. There were some nice elements (mouthfeel & appearance) but everything else collided and broke apart IMHO.

Mouthfeel - A bit prickly for me, too much carbonation?			Overall an alright brew, I wouldn't drink another unless it was the only micro on the menu. I bought a bunch of all of their usual brews, and they do make much better beers than this. I will be trying their Blackberry Scottish and Smoke next, so looking forward to those.";0;0;;1
457;Nice deep red mahogany colored pour. Greyish head that holds in the glass quite nicely. The nose is amazing, the smoked malt yeilds smoky peat moss aromas. It smells like a good Islay Scotch whiskey. The taste is just smoky and sour. There is not much else happening. The beer does not have good balance. The deep smoke flavors of the malt are diminished by a sourness which takes over. Alone the sourness of the beer is too overwhelming for me, introduce some food with it it becomes less tart and more drinkable.;1;1;;1
458;"The front label lets us know: ""Contents: Beer"". Thanks, fellas. I wouldn't have figured that one out.		I'm trying very hard to think of good things to say about this stuff. I don't like to write straight-up negative reviews. But I'm finding it difficult to say anything kind about this horrendous Kloster-fock of a beer.		Okay, it doesn't look bad. It's dark brown like leather or tree sap. The small foamy head laces the glass a li'l bit.		Speaking of tree sap: I can't help but use earthy descriptors for the smell and taste. Smell: bark, grain, dirt, straw, figs, prunes, yeast. Along with the yeast is a faint tomato soup odor. Anything that reminds me of tomato soup is already starting off on the wrong foot. Somehow, it manages to smell syrupy on top of all this.		The taste is heavy on the syrupy sweetness, like a Scotch ale. Lots of plum/fig type fruitiness. Tastes like dirt and tree bark, too. Makes me wonder if ""Barock"" is German for ""bark"".		It's almost impressive, in a way, that so many bad tastes and smells can be crammed into one bottle.		Although the freshness date is 4-2-05 (which probably means Feb. 4, 2005 since this is brewed in Deutschland), I can't help but think that this bottle must have been sitting out in the bright lights of World Market for way too long. Or maybe the ""05"" means 1905. The objective reviewer in me says that a beer can't possibly be meant to taste like this and wants to buy another bottle just in case this one was horribly spoiled. The realistic part of me, however, would rather spend $2.29 on a pint of pureed cow manure.";0;0;;1
459;"This brew poured almost flat, but tasting revealed a light carbonation upon drinking. The color was a very nice raspberry tinted amber. Just what you might expect from this kind of brew. 	The taste was much better than most fruit beers I've experienced. The hop profile actually made itself known, but the raspberries were not hiding behind them. Overall it was a nice balance between fruit and beer. 	The body was light, but since I don't know the underlying beer for this brew, it's hard to say if they hit the mark here. All I will say is that it was very refreshing and drinkable. I could have a few of these on a hot summer day.";0;0;;1

I opened this one (the first one in the 4-pack) after a long day and was worried that a fruit beer like this might not satisfy my fix. I am not usually a fan of fruit beers but this one is top notch.

T&M- Just as smooth as it is crisp. Strong hop bitterness, sweet grassy malted barley brushes across the palate with dry biscuity notes. Spiciness from the hops is pronounced with a light and dry finish that holds a long road of flavor.		D- With the use of hop extracts this beer almost tastes too fresh ... or perhaps I am used to old bottles.

Thin and kind of dry, could be drier. 		It's a good example of the style that's definitely better than Guinness.";1;1;;1
480;"Pour: Light copper color with hints of red. Two and a half fingers of off-white head that sticks around for awhile and laces the glass nicely. 		Smell: Strong grapefruit aroma up front. Underlying tones of pine, caramel, and slightly fruity. 		Taste: Citrus and piney hops make their presence known up front, followed by a rich caramel malty character that's slightly biscuity. Some hints of tropical fruit also come through, and finishes with a huge tart grapefruit bitterness. Beautifully balanced flavor. 		Mouthfeel: Medium body and oily. Coats the mouth with hop oils. Pretty high carbonation. Dry finish. 		Drinkability: Very smooth drinking IPA. Refreshing and delicious.		Final Notes: A delicious IPA that comes in a can. What more could you ask for? Has enough flavor for pairing against a spicy meal, but refreshing enough for tailgating, fishing/camping trips, days at the country club, and the like. A good all-around beer.";1;1;;1
481;"On tap at the Cincinnati Airport location, in a shaker.		The beer had a near opaque body, with ruby highlights. It formed a slight off-white glass ring, from the stadium pour.

The beer didn't pair well with pulled pork, but was alright by itself.";1;1;;1

Hints of vanilla, licorice, and even some caramel. This is pretty complicated and very good.		Taste: Like candy. Seriously though, this beer is hugely complex. It starts sweet and develops smooth caramel malts before a twinge of plum, raisin, and grapes come through. There is a slight bitter finish that cleans the palate.

Poured straw gold into a nonic, coming with a lacing of white foam. The smell was malty and buttery. Diacetyl shining through in another of Cooperstown brews. It tasted like buttered bread, with some nut tones. The feel was harsh, and grainy. Not a very good brew, with so much diacetyl and so little hop notes.

A: dark golden in colour, with a thin off-white foamy head and very low carbonation.	S: lightly lemony aroma with Challenger's citric edge prevails, while a swirl wakes up the sulphurous and buttery note underneath. Overall, the nose is ""quietly"" pleasant.	T: the foretaste highlights Goldings' citric and Liberty's flowery fragrant flavours; the tannic bitterness (almost like crushed citrus seeds) develops at the back with an additional touch of lychee fruits. The long aftertaste sees more lingering maltiness, but the chewy/tangy bitterness still rules here.	M&D: softly fizzy and light-bodied, this is a session type of Golden Bitter designed to quaff. This ale on cask rates much higher than the bottled version, and features a relatively complex hop profile that's rare for most English Bitters. Recommended!";0;0;;1

495;"Big thanks to Bill (?) on sending me this in a trade not too long ago. Decided I would spend my Saturday ticking off beers that are long overdue from my fridge. Had this previously and remember enjoying it, hope that wasn't a fluke... Poured into my Hopleaf pint glass.		A- Frothy toothpaste like head with random dispersion of not quite white, bubbles. Average amount of time to dissipate left me with a thicker than normal skin and a solid collar that has bubbles reminiscent of cooking pancakes.		Body the color of orange peel revealed tons of carbonation. Many bubbles, no streams, all dancing their way up in various sizes. 		S- Ketchup.. no joke. The intial note was sweet and confusing, but definitely similar to ketchup. Further investigation revealed the classic odor of pumpkin and the barest hints of nutmeg.		T- The opening is ketchup! What the hell? I thought it might be the glass, so I took some swigs from the bottle and it definitely is ketchup flavors to begin with. It flows forward to reveal the pumpkin flavor. This slowly ebbs away giving a finish that could be of earthy, meaty, squashes mixed with nutmeg. Unfortunately it is too faint to truly enjoy.		M- Thin, over carbonated to distracting proportions, and not much lingering capabilities. This definitely falls on the watery side of beer. For a low alcohol beer, the ethanol definitely perks up to tingle in an unwelcomed manner.		D- Never again. It just is too mediocre to really want again. I can think of half a dozen other pumpkin beers I'd like to have in its place and that is just off the top of my head. Too many errors and things need fixing that I addressed above.";0;0;;1

498;"Likely the most promising brew on their docket. A very delicate and characterful brew. Opens with a burst of citrus, spiciness, and soft pilsner malts. These characteristics bridge over to flavors easily, bringing a juicy, fruity sweetness reliant mainly on lemons, banannas, and berries, but spiced with clove, pepper, corriander, and orange peel.

502;My first wet hopped ale and from one of my favorite breweries, so I'm going into this with high expectations. Pours a slightly cloudy light gold with a medium white head which subsides to a nice lacing. The aroma is strong with citrus fruits: lemon, grapefruit, and slight taste of orange. Flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma. Lemon and grapefuit. Big hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma for a pale ale. There is almost no malt flavor in this beer, just a straightforward hop lovers delight. I even let the beer warm up to close to room temperature and still got no malt presence. This beer has the body of a pale ale and the hop presence of an ipa. I prefer my ipas with a little more complexity and malt presence, but this is still a good beer and ideal if you're craving a hop fix.;1;1;;1

506;Always looking for new beers to try, I found this beer recently at my fav liquor store, grouped with Russian beers as this is surely the only Lithuanian beer marketed in the US. This beer came with a special hard to miss tag advertising the alcohol content as 9.5% ... it showed. I was surprised upon pouring the beer that it poured a nice copper colour, I guess I was expecting something much darker. The beer certainly smelled of alcohol, but not nearly what I was expecting. The initial mouthfeel was decent considering the alcohol content ... but the aftertaste was excessively strong malt and alcohol, with the sweetness of honey. Sorry, but I would advise against this beer, perhaps fine for those Lithuanian winters when one runs out of vodka, but just too much of an alcohol taste for my likes.;0;0;;1

526;"Appearance  This is a gorgeous, clear brownish-orange in color with a nice, white head that showed great retention.		Smell  The dry-hopping is clearly evident here. The hop profile is very floral with some light pine but very, very fresh as sold on the label.		Taste  The hops, which I guess are locally-grown, are big at the taste as well. They impart a very different flavor though than hops from the PacNW or East Coast so tamper expectations for something different. The flavor is very raw and nasty and will be especially appreciated by the hard-core hopheads who are always looking for something a little different.		This beer is very floral in its flavor. If youve ever eaten fresh flowers you got the idea, and actually the leafy notes are similar to dandelion greens. If you can pick up the malt base then kudos to ya but I find it hard to identify. I cant stress enough how fresh this beer tastes which is exactly how it is billed on the bottle.		Mouthfeel  This medium-bodied ale is only slightly bitter and has mild carbonation.

532;"My bottle is slightly over carbonated. 		Pours a loose head that fades quickle. Medium dark amber with very little hop aroma.		Very drinkable as there is moderate bitterness and balanced malt. The lack of hop aroma is appropriate for the style. Some peat flavors late in the taste.";1;0;;0
533;"Grabbed at the local food coop. Poured into 10oz glass. Poured a semi-hazy orangeish-yellow with just a thin cap of white head that had low retention and lacing.		The aroma was alcohol and bananas. Maybe a hint of rum. The flavors were pretty much the same. The body was thin, yet still managed to be sticky. While not terrible the beer was unpleasant enough to make 10 ounces tough to drink. I'm glad I shared the rest of the bottle. I'm not sure how the guys I shared it with felt about it though.		Overall, a below average beer. Try it for the hell of it, but you won't be missing anything if you skip it.";0;0;;1
534;The Weizen has a hint of smoke to it(which may have been stronger, but I just drank their Mrzen). The beer was quite dark, in fact much darker than even your standard Dunkel Weiss.

Flavors of rasberry tart pie, freshly ground rasberry puree and rasberry pez candy meld together to create one hell of an interesting fruit beer. A very nice balance of tart, sweet and malty mold together. 		In many ways, this reminded me of the Lindemans Framboise. I think the similarities between these two beers are plentiful, making me even further question if the Lindemans Framboise is a true Lambic or a Fruit Beer. Nevertheless, this brew is original, extremely fruity and easy to drink.";1;1;;1

The aftertaste is also sweet with a long lasting alcoholic flavour. 		The carbonation is average.		As usual, a pale lager at 10% is too strong for being enjoyable.";0;0;;1
537;"Interesting but not entirely successful. First bottle was incredibly foamy, possibly infected, so I was maybe too careful with the second since this time there's no head to speak of. Dark for the style. Good caramel malts with rich butter and toffee flavors overshadowed by indelibly tart green apple flavor. Initially an interesting balance but grows tiresome. Mouthfeel a touch too fizzy, like soda. I don't know if the apple flavor comes from the hops but it serves the same purpose, to dry out the finish but unfortunately does not tickle the tongue into wanting more sips. I wonder if these could be old bottles since they seem a bit off; not ruined but lacking refinement. Put dates on your labels, Cooperstown.";0;0;;1

539;F***ing green bottles. This one was skunked pretty badly. The head was impressive and the taste was good.

540;After spending $8.99 for a six-pack, I was disappointed. Light in color and body, lacking any distinctive taste, surely not of the true marzen style. Taste mediocre, alcohol kick sorely missing, particularly for the style. Definitely a step down from other Stoudt's products.;0;0;;1

Taste/mouthfeel: big, bitterness up at the top, pucker and wince, then it winds down. Too, too sour, as well. Not a pleasant experience, actually. Malt is light, body is not firm enough to provide adequate resistence to this intense unrelenting citric bitter bite. Gets mild after that first swallow, but it continues beating the tongue, and it's a bit tough to take. 		Halfway in, and it's toned down a touch, but it still makes for a miss off the mark of a pale ale. 		""A finely balance session brew. rich golden color, firm body, hopped with Cascade."" Well, something went wrong here. Balance isn't fine, can't imagine a session with this sourness, and ...wooo! Just took another sip...still alarmingly sour!

549;"Yet another cheap looking Trafalgar bottle gives birth to a depressing looking beer. For a few fleeting moments we have a creamy tan head, but that's fizzed away before the Jeapordy buzzer sounds. All that remains is a dark brown liquid, reminiscent of cola. Actually, I find this comparison unfair - its far more reminiscent of flat cola, as the brewery seem to have pulled all the stops out to deal with their carbonation issues, and banish bubbles for good.		Smells of stale coffee - the weak kind that I make in the morning and forget about. Its a smoked beer, but there's not too much smoke in the nose, although there are vague sour notes lurking at the very back. It tastes like someone rinsed out an ashtray and bottled the liquid with a lump of charcoal and the dregs of a cup of stale coffee. There's even a slight sour fruitiness to it that just screams 'keep me somewhere warm and I'll turn into vinegar within a week. What on earth are they thinking, and are the LCBO so starved of options that they think its acceptable to sell this crap? The body only compounds these errors, clocking in at slightly lighter than water with only a ghost of carbonation.

555;"Appearance: The beer pours as a dark amber and turns nearly all black in the glass. When held up to the light, maroon colors shine through and the black lightens a bit and takes some red hue. A medium head in terms of size and body, which dissipated a little quickly, with a thin layer remaining.		Smell: The smoky flavor isn't immediately detectable in the smell. More of a roasty hop and thick malt smell comes from the beer, with a light smoke smell in the background. After the first taste, the smoke scent is burned into my mind, so it is impossible to not believe I'm smelling it from that point forward.		Taste: I was a little hesitant about having a smoked porter. The smoke flavor turned out to not be as dominant as I expected. It is quite pleasant and reminds me of smoked pork, especially charred portions of the meat. However, I would have liked the smoke flavor to be more rounded in the beer. I almost felt like the smoke taste hit my taste buds as a novelty, then disappeared. The porter did start to make me crave barbecue. What a curse on a rainy night, but I can't blame the beer.		Mouthfeel: Good feel in the mouth, not heavy, not light. It's a very easy porter to drink. If I had to make a case for a specific feeling, it would be that it almost feels too light on the tongue for its smoky taste.		Drinkability: I was expecting more of a smoked body with this beer. However, considering the porter didn't have such a heavy and meaty feel as I was anticipating, it turns out that could be a very flavorful beer that could be enjoyed throughout the night.";1;1;;1

The taste is much hoppier than the smell but the lovely motes of citrus remain.		The mouthfeel is good, however I enjoy highly carbonated lighter beers like this one.

560;I poured this beer from the big ceramic bottle into the only weizenstarkbier glass I know of, my Aventinus glass. It doesn't make any of the usual wheat beer attempts to raise a voluminous head, but at 13%, this is perfectly acceptable. I managed to get a half finger head, which quickly fell to a skinny tan-yellow glass ring, over a deep yellow brown body that is a little translucent. The nose is deeply alcoholic, wheaty, a bit spicy. peppery, clovey, with a bit of banana bread, and some nice fruitiness. There's also a spice or vegetable scent I pick up that's a little off. The taste is wild - highly alcoholic, very sweet, with various fruity ester floating about. I also pick up a distinct burnt taste, akin to meat of some sort. The mouth is very full, almost viscous, and the carbonation is somewhat low. It's really too strong to be an easy drinker, and not too well put together.;1;0;;0
561;"Pours an amber color with hints of red. Slightly hazy with no head to speak of.		When I took a sniff of this beer while in the bottle, there was a pretty decent maple aroma, however upon pouring into my chalice, the aroma was predominately bourbon, oak and vanilla.		The flavor is overwhelmingly bourbon-like. Additionally there are some traditional barleywine-ish flavors consisting of s strong malt presence as well as some oakiness and residual maple flavors. The finish is quite bitter, Founder's really must have upped the hop content to contend with the overall bourbony, sweet character of this beer, leading to a fairly well balanced brew, which has quite a bit of alcohol presence overall, although should improve and mellow out with some age.		Wow, this beer is a real experience. More bourbon forward than probably any beer I've had, aside from Backwoods Bastard. As is, this beer is incredibly complex and intensely flavored. Right now, there is a ton of heat, but I can only imagine it's potential with a year or two on it.";0;0;;1

567;this is one of my first notes in my beer review book from a trip to paris when i was fifteen... i drank mostly harp and also tried lambic a couple times although i cant remember the brands of which... anyways if anyones seen robin williams live on broadway his impression of a repulsed old british dude would sum up this beer.... oh dear christ!!! the sugars were off the chart, not even in the malt category at that point... my bro tasted it and told me it tasted like redbull to him... i doubt that could be taken as a compliment an any light.... although i must say i still felt dignified in buying this... beer is expensive in paris and therefore the more alcohol per serving the better... plus the can did have a very cool design on it... i almost saved it but was too drunk to remember haha anyways i only had one due to the fact that i learned my lesson the first time with this beer after the taste of the second half made me almost puke off our second floor balcony.... lol what a memory!!! cheers!!!!;0;0;;1
568;"Picked up this bottle a while ago at West Lakeview Liquors - shared with friends alongside BA B.O.R.I.S. and served in a generic pint glass.		A - Big late-rising dark mocha foam that slowly settles to a thick ring and nearly complete cap with some patchy lacing. Pitch black - not even the slightest bit of color.		S - Cocoa, dark fruits, roasted malts, burnt sugars. This smells like an older bottle, without any hint of the higher IBUS listed on the bottle. Smells kind of like a higher-gravity L'Aphrodisiaque, but without the vanilla presence. It's a pretty solid, but perhaps slightly too sweet, RIS.		T - The taste is a fair bit different, with more emphasis on dark chocolate, a touch of coffee, and roastiness galore. There's a strong acidic and bitter aftertaste that I'm not sure is related to the hop content or to the intense roast flavors. Again, good stuff here, but nothing mind-blowing.		M - The mouthfeel is superb - the oatmeal really comes out here. Cask-like smoothness with mild carbonation that keeps things from being syrupy. Big, viscous, body that supports the ABV and flavor exceptionally well.		D - The ABV is very well hidden, and the mouthfeel is superb. Combined with the more than adequete flavor this is an excellent, and fairly easy to obtain, RIS. Just watch out for the mounting bitterness!";1;1;;1
569;I don't think I've ever had this stuff before, may never again, but supposidly this is the king of ghetto juice. Pours a brownish golden color, no head. Smells a bit sweet, like corn syrup.

575;"My wife is German, but from the North. There they have all kinds of local Pilsner, but not specialties like Icebeer or Smoked Beers. So when we found this Franconian specialty, of course the temptation was huge to try this. Other beer connaisseurs warned us, but she could not resist and bought it. Luckily just one single bottle! 		Poured darkred-brown into mug, thick off-white head crowning. The smokey aroma is noticeable already.		The first sip hits, full smokey now.		Foam is thick and creamy, but is vanishing fast. After 2 minutes it is completely gone, leaving behind a very thin layer. But there is a lot of lacing.		The taste is so heavily smokey, it is overwhelming any other tastes and aromas.		Mouthfeel is ashtray-y.		Taste is not improving with time.		Bitter aftertaste, but smoke is still overwhelmingly on top. I imagine I drank from an ashtray.		I wonder how this beer would taste if it was blended with something milder?		This reminds me of Tarry Lapsang Souchong, a chinese smoked tea that tastes very similar to this beer. That tea cannot be enjoyed purely, but when blended 20/80 with milder teas from China, India and Ceylon, it becomes a wonderful delicassy. 	Now I really wonder how this Franconian beer would perform if it was blended with milder beers, or even sodas.		If I ever get another bottle of this brew, I will definately mix it to try some improvements. It is not enjoyable to drink this pure. You might as well lick an ashtray.";0;0;;1
576;"I am a huge fan of Founders but generally do not find Old Ales that I like out there. That made the Old Curmudgeon an interesting and bold purchase for me personally. The blend of overall sweetness along with the thickness in feel and overall complex flavors to old ales has made it difficult for me to find one I love. 		I poured a 12oz bottle medium speed into a beveled 16oz NERAX pint glass. The beer poured out showing a strikingly perfect color for my tastes in a beer like this: a blend of brown caramel and burnt pumpkin orange colors surrounded the glass while at an angle looking upwards towards the thin head I see a deeper brown, almost like a stained mahogany. I know this is a ""thick"" beer and I haven't had a taste. Smell was of slight vanilla, caramel and raisin. No single smell seemed outright dominant. Extremely pleasurable smell in this beer. Upon first taste I am almost overwhelmed. First opinion was that this was indeed a ""thick"" beer. The mouthfeel was a tad surprising at first but soon I adjusted and the thickness of the beer was preferred. I soon realized how wonderfully balanced tasting a beer of this complexity is. Malty to my tastes, but not in a bad way. Just the right amount of caramel and mild malt balances things out by cutting the smack you get from the strength of the beer. This makes this beer very, very drinkable despite the punch it packs. I'm not 100% sold that I want a beer with this much action in the mouthfeel (initial lip hit, tongue fall of the beer, the follow-up coating of the tongue with thickness of the malt) but if you know you want an Old Ale, this has to come recommended. I think this is a solid A- on my personal scale. Only reason I say it can improve is the mouthfeel to me at this young age is still really thick. I have 3/4 of the pack down in the cellar for aging. I strongly believe this is a candidate with some aging and will be researching to see just how long people have been holding this for.";1;1;;1

578;"1pt 0.9 fl oz bottle. If you are a Python fan, give a read to the label. The ""Tempered over burning witches"" comment on the label was some good humor. For that alone it goes on my ""beer shelf"". I didn't see a freshness date.		Appearance - Crisp clear amber/orange color. A marginal head formed upon pour that resolved into a thin lacing that retained on the walls of the chalice. Some have reviewed this as having a big full head. I didn't see that. Perhaps it was a bit too cold when I poured.		Smell - Hop-heads should like this one. Really pronounced with a slight flower-like aroma. 		Taste - wow, sharp bite which was unexpected. I've been drinking too many belgians lately so this one ""took me back"" to another land/style. A real hoppy taste that resounds thru this beer. Comparing this to a Boddingtons or Sam Smith I really see this as a middle of the road beer for the style. I did sense a bit of a fruity flavoring as well, but only after it warmed a bit. Did have a bitter (which is marked for the style) presentation as well.		Mouthfeel - Crisp/dry feel that leaves little on the tongue. It felt a bit thin for me and I really can't get over the bite. I've had other English Pales that were much smoother/richer. 		Drinkability - Nope, not another one for me. Nice to say I tried it, but not a good representation of the style. At least to my taste.";1;0;;0
579;"Zahre Canapa is a pils-based beer with hemp adjuncts. 750 ml, best before date says six months after bottling (August 2010). Pours pale yellow body with cloudy appearance due to suspension of tiny yeasty particles, topped by quickly dissipating white head. Hemp-dominated aroma with citric overtones and notes of hops.

Light bodied with soft carbonation.	If you cant choose between alcohol and a joint this one is for you.";0;0;;1
580;Had this on tap at Dark Lord Day 2011. It was a golden color with a little bit of a pink tinge and a surprising bourbon/vanilla/oak smell. I loved it because that lovely boozey bourbon takes center stage sandwiched between a genuine tart cherry beginning and end, but I can see that it wouldn't be for everyone. The body is also nice and sticky, giving the beer some real weight in the mouth. I would definitely seek this out again... a strong fruit beer that's not afraid to embrace alcohol!;1;1;;1
581;"Poured into pils glass:		Pours golden straw yellow with a two+ finger head that thins to a lasting cover.		The smell is mild, but clean and what's there is nice - some grainy malt with a hint of grassiness and underlying fruitiness.		The taste is of prominent Saaz-like hops that emerge on the first sip, but soon balanced by a sweet grainy malt. An underlying leamony/applish fruitiness adds complexity to the fresh, grassy hops. Balanced, leaning towards bitter. Crisp with a bittersweet, rather dry, finish. The taste lingers well.		The body is light and refreshing. It approaches medium while remaining appropriately light.		There is enough refreshing smoothness and a nice taste to make this a fine ""session"" brew.";1;1;;1
582;"I must say the mere mention of smoke in the description of this one was what drew me in. Very intriguing at first until I took a whiff of it. Extremely strong smell of liquid smoke, which for some may make it unbearable. Very dark brown/almost black in color with very little foam or lacing albeit the glass given to me was much too small for the 0.5 liter bottle. As for taste and mouthfeel, this was my first smokebeer, so I was taken aback by the flavors a bit. If you can get past the intense burnt wood smell, you will notice that the beer itself is rather smooth, malty, and quite crisp. Very light on the tongue yet chewy at the same time if you can believe that. As for drinkability, this is definitely not a session beer, and it should definitely be paired with something grilled on the backyard BBQ. The smokiness would go well with steaks and ribs; its crispness and levity would go well with chicken and pork. Overall though, at $8 a bottle, once and done is enough for me.";1;0;;0
583;"Draught samples at the Belgian Beer Fest on 10/27/06, Night of the Barrels 2/9/07, and many, many draught tulips at the brewpub.		Dark, root beer brown, similar to some other Flemish sours, though darker than amber-mahogany even, and without as much of a ruby-magenta tint (though still some reddish-violet tinges when held to the light). Head varies by the glass, but seems to be initially medium in height, moderately dense and beige in color. It fades rather rapidly, however, staying at partial cover and eventually just a light ring, and providing only minimal lacing. Unfiltered, but well-conditioned (been in the barrel for two years) and thus shows a medium-high clarity. Only light trails of bubbles seen in the liquid.		Beautifully expressive nose. Full of acetobacteric acids, lending that defining Flemish sour ale vinegary nose. But lacto is fast on the heels of the acetic acid, drying it out marvelouslly and contributing unripened grapefruit rind and strong yogurt sourness. Light chocolate and bits of vanilla cream-like sugars begin to balance things, but are generally quite reserved, leaving it very dry, but with a charming, juicy acidity from the dark malts and bacteria. Barrel character is moderate, very light on tannins, quite a neutral barrel it seems. Some light earthiness and woodiness helps add to the complexity, but I keep getting drawn back to the acetic/lactic knockout combination. Some raisins, dates and figs are lightly displayed upon warming, with more light vanilla and dry wood notes. Very high strength of aroma, fantastically sniffable. No alcohol noted.		The flavor contains every bit of the juicy acetic acidity from the nose and then some. Chocolate and cola notes with a pinch of vanilla sweetness set the stage for a flash of bright acetic acid, which quickly dries in to the most compelling lactobacillus sourness. Exactly what you find in Cantillon Gueuze or some of 3F newer gueuzes. Delicious and very lip-smacking. It cleanses the palate midway and allows for a tart, fruity, brett-like finish that also displays light black pepper and earthy/woody barrel character. Roast is just slightly apparent, but is more of a light charred oakiness. Brilliantly engaging carbonation for a draught beer, very tight and lending a near creaminess. Perfectly attenuated, not too dry and certainly not too sweet.		Wow. Best beer Ive had from Cambridge, by far, in the 4 years Ive been going here. This is going to make me drop my ratings for some other Flemish sour ales. The dryness and lambic qualities, with the moderate oak, light char and tinges of brett just show so much complexity. And you definitely gotta respect that this is 100% spontaneously fermented.		Oh, and I should also note that Will (the brewer) says its not acetobacteria, but the lactobacillus causing the acidity. Smells/tastes like some vinegar to me, but perhaps just a mix of lacto and oak. Who knows! Who cares!";0;0;;1
584;"Appearance: Served up a faintly hazed, light copper-hued body beneath a small, snow white head.		Smell: Presents a pleasing medley of understated notes smelling ever so lightly of toasty, bready barley, spice-hinting noble hops, and orchard fruit.		Taste: A tasty blend of tangy, delicately grainy Pils and toasty Munich malts with no more than a smidgen of overall sweetness. Thin fruit traces of apple and pear. Subtly spicy German hops with enough bitterness to balance. Sustains a lightly bready maltiness until the clean, crisp finish.		Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium carbonation.		Drinkability: Toubabe is very nice, very classy, very well-balanced and my favorite during my first visit to Craggie Brewing.";1;1;;1

587;What a joke. Bottle opened with no pop or fizz and poured with no head at all. The color looked like a hazy fleshy peach tea. Taste has just a hint of malt and although there's a little fruit it isn't clearly a pomegranate taste. Consistency is like a cheap wine cooler. And then to top it all off there's the 12% alcohol and although I'm not against higher alcohol in beers in this case it just added burn. Frankly this beer is like taking a cheap peach tea and spiking it with a harsh grappa. This bottle is pure marketing folks. There's a cockatoo in a Hawaiian shirt squeezing a pomegranate into a beer, like it's a drink of tropical origin, but it was made in Lithuania. When I'd glanced at the label in the store I thought it said South Carolina but it turned out that was just the importer. Anyway, they should have spelled it Cacatoo because this beer (if it even is beer) is caca.;0;0;;1
588;Comes in green bottles although mine were not skunked. Smells lightly of sweet hops. Pours a gold color that leaves a frothy white head that quickly leaves without a trace.

592;"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. No dating info. It was black in color. Slight carb in center and some lacing. It had a large tan head that slowly settled into a film and collar. 		The aroma was dark fruit, weak coffee and roasted malt. Wasn't getting the chocolate that others mentioned. Not a big fan of dark fruit aromas. Also missed the chocolate and stronger coffee aromas that I usually find in this style. As is, it didn't really excite me that much. The taste followed the aroma. Tasted more like a baltic porter to me than an American porter - which goes counter to a lot of reviews and the recent switch here from baltic to American in style. 		Overall, a disappointment for me. I've had 2 other Hoppin' Frogs that were excellent and AmPorter is one of my favorite styles so expected a lot and got a little.

619;Pours a very opaque and muddy brownish red in color. No head forms at all on the pour. You can immediately pick up some fruity tones upon popping the cap. That's where the positives cease. This tastes like a fruity alco-pop. Very fruity and alcoholic. Like a cheap bottle of Mad Dog 20/20. Medium mouthfeel and a somewhat cloying aspect. I love my boys at Founders, but they severly missed with this one.;0;0;;1
620;"Appearance: Pours an inviting ruby brown and presents just a thin tan head.		Smell: Fruity and sweet like plums and apricots. I could sniff at this till my head spins, I get dizzy and fall out and not detect a single hop note.		Taste: A malty fruit basket and not much else. There is some bittering and dryness on the end but not enough.		Mouth-feel: Light bodied and a wee bit thin.		Overall: Not a bad brew but I wouldn't recommend.";0;0;;1
621;"A- Completely black opaque body, some dark expresso colored head.		S- Intense nose, every dark mysterious flavor is in here, chocolate, dark coffee, lots of smoke surrounding everything along with sweet bourbon and toffee with almost a syrupy sweet caramel. Smoke comes through in a burnt charred tabacco woody kind of way. Theres more to find here, see for yourself!		T- I would say the taste is more coffee foward and less on the smokey side of things, truth be told this is delicious but I appreciated the nose more with its smokey complexity. Lots of roast and acidic coffee flavors and with a shot of bourbon.		M- As massive as this beer is its not a thick as you might think, more smooth which I think enhances the flavors and enables you to find all the nuances instead of distracting you with the thickness.		O- Definitely world class, definitely original in terms of Bourbon Barrel aged beers, this brew has tons of complexity and flavors to pick out. One needs to sit on this one and contemplate all it can offer your palette.";1;0;;0
622;Horse Piss huh? ...actually they're not far off. The beer has a few good qualities, buy mostly not. Aromas start off mildly skunky but fades quickly into a moderate hop (English?) aroma. A decent malt base is laced with adjunct grains that become too distracting to ignore. Tastes malty and ligthly hopped at first, then the corn / rice flavors mask the malty caramel and bready flavors. Finishes too astringent (grain husks) to be considered clean. Aged hops persist through the finish and into the aftertaste. Living in the horse capitol of the world, I'm a little disapointed in this representing brew.;0;0;;1
623;"This brew is definitely too much of a good thing. I'm sure it's a hop lover's delight, but I just don't get what all the raving is all about. Pours a deep hazy gold in color with a loose white head. Nose is intense hops, grapefruit and pine, incredibly pungant and alcoholic. Taste is very much the same, very drying on the palate, not a pleasant experience. Mouthfeel is slick and oily, coats the palate. This is a horribly out of balance brew and something I just don't care much for. 		Slinte!";1;0;;0
624;"Pilot Rock is brown with ruby highlights and sports a thin head with no lace. It started with a nice roasted aroma and flavor. But these initial selling points lacked sustain. Most dimensions are otherwise customary with a slightly thin body. 		Served on tap at the Siskiyou Pub, Ashland, OR.";1;1;;1
625;"Appearance... Looks very dark. Pours very dark with about a half inch of cream colored head.		Smells... Burnt, smokey scent is what stands out. Hints of chocolate and coffee.		Taste... Strong coffee flavor, which transitions into a bitter coffee flavor. Not very impressive.	 	Mouthfeel.. Watery. Light creamy texture. More appropriate for a porter than a stout.		Overall... It's a disappointing beer. Had great expectations for this one.";1;1;;1
626;"Picked up a 12 oz. single of this at the store. I'm drinking on 11/24, which puts the age at between 1 and 2 months according to the Founder's release schedule.		Appearance: Nice bit of head forms on top of a clear, bubbly, and yellow gold body. Very slight lacing that ends of disappearing by the time I'm done drinking.		Aroma: Very earthy in both the malt and hop bills. Hops are herbal and grassy with a slight piney touch too. They are what really shine through, but the malt does contribute a nice grainy scent too.		Taste: Very well balanced. The hops provide most of the flavor, but the malt is definitely playing a role too. Big notes of herbal hop flavor, not bitterness, lead off. Once the initial hop burst fades, a very nice and slightly toasted bread quality balances the flavor out before a more piney, but not overwhelming, hop bitterness takes effect in the linger.		Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is light-bodied and very gulpable. The carbonation keeps things light on the palette and contributes to not just the flavor profile, but also to how easy to drink this beer is.		Overall: Easily one of the best fresh-hopped beers I've tried. We are not going for IPA standards of hoppiness, which helps accentuate the more subtle and delicate flavors fresh hop brews can deliver. Many fresh hop IPAs feel like a mouth full of grass or meadow. This one, because it goes for a more subtle tone of a pale ale, creates a fantastic brew.";1;1;;1
627;"A=amber/copper color, a little lighter than expected, gentle one finger head that laced nicely		S=good smell, balanced with gentle hops and even amounts of malts		T=very balanced flavors, hops are noticeable with some fruity and floral flavors, malts balance and finish with slight sweetness		M=good feel finishes strong		D=very drinkable, and enjoyable.";1;1;;1
628;"I picked this up at the main train station in Luzern, Switzerland. I have to figure out a way to pack this bottle into my already overstuffed luggage...		A - straw colored and clear. Chalk white head that falls to a very nice foam cap that never truly dies. 		S - Pilsner malt, an ever so slight hint of hops, but nothing amazing or even so-so.		T/M - Very light bodied. Very little in the way of flavor. A slight hint of malt if you really search for it but essentially flavorless.		D - Great novelty, terrible beer.";1;0;;0
629;"A- Thin dark mocha head on a black body. Little lacing.	S- Big coffee aroma with hints of oatmeal. Some drier scent too.	T- Big blend of coffee and oatmeal. Has a dry bitterness in it from the malts and hops. In the aftertaste coffee just dominates the flavors. Lacks complexity.	M- Full body with low carbonation.	D- I really wasn't a fan of this. Seems very simple and I really can't see the attraction behind it. Way to much coffee for me also.";1;1;;1
630;"Color: Copper with a nice off-white head that fades quickly		Aroma: Citrusy and floral hops, hint of roses.		Flavor: Sweet malt, citrusy flavor upfront, then a weird dose of roses! What the F@$K! Fading to a nice bitterness. Full-bodied.		Overall: Aaaaa, I'm not sure I like this either, that rose flavor is really throwing me off. It's not my favorite IPA, of that I'm sure.";1;0;;0
631;"Bottled 11/5/10, Reviewed 11/3/11		A very thick opaque black pour with minimal tan head and lacing.		Smells of bitter chocolate and dark coffee.		Strong dark roasted coffee upfront followed by bitter chocolate, with some dark malts mixed in. The hops aren't really present, but not surprising since this was bottled a year ago. 		Smooth mouthfeel with a dry finish.		Overall this is one my favorite beers that is readily available. I must say I prefer a fresh bottle as the hops balance out the massive roastiness. Regardless this is one to savor no matter how old it is.";1;1;;1
632;"A - Yellow-goldish appearance on initial pour, medium amounts of foamy lacing appearing on the Pilsner-style glass after consumption, Very dense foamy head that settles at about the 3/4 finger mark. High carbonation.		S - Floral notes throughout, with very subtle grassy notes slowly following the initial floral notes. 		T - Very malty with a slightly bitter taste for the type of beer it is, sometimes present in beers with a higher ABV%. A ""dry"" beer with a malty aftertaste.		M - Velvety; pleasant, albeit has ""dry"" aftertaste.		D - Goes down a tad rough at first but it redeems itself later the more you drink of it, and more floral notes shine through.";0;0;;1
633;"Purchased at Mary Discount, outside of Utica, NY.		Pours a deep copper with the slighest reddish hue around the sides of my pint. Tinge of lacing into islands and on sides of glass.		Yummy malt, delicious malt, wow. Sweet prune, maybe honey malt, rum raisin. No hops, smells like an all malt lager.		Medium malt, light bitter ... maybe light a porter, like biscuit.		Abv and rum sweetness marry nicely. I bet this would handle age quite well. Mellow like a Strong ale should.		Love it. I thoroughly enjoyed my 6pack of this. Make sure to allow the temp up. Looking forward to many more.";0;1;;0
634;"12 oz bottle poured into traditional pint glass		A - Pours a cloudy light orange color with a huge, billowing head that becomes very rocky with time. Lacing is terrific. Something I expect from Duvel, not necessarily a wet-hopped pale ale. 		S - Not quite as overwhelming as many fresh-hopped ales, but the scent is still pleasant and refreshing. Grapefruit and citrus are dominant, with a touch of pine flavor. Mild sweetness. 		T - Starts with a touch of chewy sweetness that is quickly enveloped by the fruity & bitter hop flavor. As with smell, grapefruit and pine come to mind, with perhaps a hint of bubblegum. Great bitter finish that doesn't overpower. 		M - Moderate carbonation with a medium body. Good bitter & dry finish that doesn't cloy too heavily. 		D - Terrific flavor and a moderate alcohol means a pleasant drinking experience. Certainly worth picking up.";1;1;;1
635;"Immense thanks to heyta for sending me this one!		12oz bottle poured into a Jester King Grand Opening snifter		Ideally Id be drinking this with my pancakes in the morning, but that isnt such a great idea when youve got little ones to look after		A: Black with a lovely caramel-brown head. Head reduces to a welcome ring around the edge of the glass which remains throughout the duration.		S: Roasted coffee and chocolate. Possibly the most present (and pleasant) coffee/chocolate aroma of any beer Ive had. I want to drink it NOW!	 	T: Wowamazing! Where's the alcohol? Delicious espresso and powdered semi-sweet chocolate. Theres nothing off about this beer. Usually, coffee and chocolate in beer is distractingly bitter but this is perfectly balanceda delicacy.	 	M: Fairly viscous as it should be. Smooth. Mild carbonationappropriate for this style. 	 	O: I'm relieved that there isn't some sort of barrel-aged madness interfering with this one. I'll leave that to KBS. Southern Tier Choklat does chocolate better, and Peche Mortel does coffee better (slightly) but Founders Breakfast Stout is far and away the best example of combining the two. Possibly the most perfect flavored stout Ive ever had.";1;1;;1
636;"A: OK, this is pedantic, but it's simply not a pale ale. Now, I didn't call it a pale ale; BA didn't call it a pale ale; the *brewery* calls it a pale ale. It's not. It pours a clear amber to brown color with an impressive 3-finger head, not unlike a cask pour. 		S: Nicely hoppy, but with a good malt backbone.		T: Sweet malt dominates the front, with a crisp hop bite hitting in the center. The finish is decently bitter, and the aftertaste is a nice, clean, hoppy bitterness. This is a tad sweeter than your typical English PA, but it's quite good.		M: If you don't have it too cold, it comes close to a good cask ale. The bubbles are large and persistent, and the hop oils nicely coat the tongue.		D: This is a fantastic session beer. No complaints here. The balance of sweet to bitter was just about right, and left me wanting another. Bien hecho!";1;1;;1
637;Poured a deep dark brown, near black with a nice creamy head. Light through the edges of the glass. Roasted (funny word) malts with chocolate, fruits, and maybe a hint of coffee in there. Darn good taste. Chocolate and caramel malts balanced by a sweet, fruity taste after. Mouthfeel is good and medium to full. I really enjoyed this beer overall and will have to pick it up now that they have it in my former home, NC. Quite drinkable if you didn't get the point. Big thanks to Bort11 for this bottle that he got for $1.99! Drinkable and affordable is never a bad thing.;1;1;;1
638;"Poured into a stemmed tulip: Dark purple-ish brown that you can round up to black, with faint ruby highlights under a finger of soft tan head that drops & clings to the sides. Looks rich, with gauzy lacing that slides down slowly.		Smells of a rich, deep stewed prune & raisin fruitiness, hoppiness like cooked grapefruit, orange peel, with a rum-like zing, some toffee. This is a big ol' nose. Some slightly overcooked pie crust comes in.		Big malt & hop flavor, dark fruits again, a little molasses, a lot of rich, dark caramel & a strong, bracing booze presence. Yeah, definitely getting the booze, but it's a welcome guest. Even a little mint shows up.		Full, smooth, a little sticky, a little warming. Real nice.		Damn, this is good. There's nothing unexpected here flavor-wise, except how awesome this tastes. They just got everything right & I'm loving it.";1;1;;1
639;"I changed the oil in my car this past weekend, and the oil coming out of the crankcase was no less black or viscous than this beer. This is about as black as beer gets. No light makes its way through the glass, not even the edges. The head is frothy and dark tan. Sticks to the sides, but settles down into a thin skim in only a few minutes.	The smell is huge. There's a lot of beer in this beer. Roasted barley, dry cocoa, a bit of sourness which I thought was strange. The taste and mouthfeel are where this beer shines. The taste isn't as kick-you-in-the-teeth, scratch your tastebuds dry and roasty as I expected. It's smooth, and a bit sweet. Coffee beans are quite pronounced in the taste, as is some bakers' chocolate. The mouthfeel is the creamiest thing I've ever tasted. It's velvety smooth. Drinkability is quite good considering the density of flavors and the high ABV. There's just something a bit funky about the smell.";1;1;;1
640;I had this at the brewery's bar, but it's still not a whole lot better than the bottled version. Comes out a good looking slightly cloudy pale gold under a one finger white head with decent staying power and quite nice lace down most of the mug. The nose was a touch on the sour side of fruity, with the mouth was well carbonated and fairly heavy. The sour fruit carries over into the taste, although it is quite mild and lets some malt flavor break through. There are, however, no noticeable hops here. The aftertaste is a bit stale. There are better things to drink in this bar...;0;0;;1
641;Can: Poured a medium amber color ale with a great white bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of light malt with some hints of sweetness. Taste is also comprised of semi-sweet malt with no hops discernable. Body is lightly creamy but overall this beer is really lacking in character.;1;1;;1
642;Solid pour with a black slightly viscous body and a relatively thin head. Smells quite roasty and with a heady dose of licorice as well as a slightly mentholated aroma. Satisfyingly deep and roasty in the flavor department with some fruity, vinous notes as well. Quite pleasant and on the roastier side of balanced. Quite smooth and very drinkable. A very nice beer.;1;1;;1
643;"Picked up a single 12 ounce bottle in Western Mass.		Appearance is nearly black with close to one finger of head.	Its` smell is quite nice, with some vanilla, bourbon, and dark roasted malts. Taking a sip of BB, I get some oak, scotch, a little chocolate. MF is medium-heavy, a bit rich. All in all, this is a very nice scotch ale. I continue to be happy from my Founders purchases when I am traveling to/through nearby states (live in CT).";1;1;;1
644;"Sad to say this is my first review since moving to Mexico. I clearly would not have bothered if I'd read reviews first, but I was at the supermarket and I saw something I'd never seen. 		Color is just fine, a little translucent for a bock but I'm throwing that style out the window right now. Orange with a brownish tint. Head is pretty massive at first, tons of big bubbles, but it settles down into a craggy, creamy delight. 		Way downhill from there. Nose is thin and skunky. If a good lager nose is clean, this is dirty. Sharp metallic note. Flavor follow suit, skunky with a tainted medicinal quality. Like bad aspirin. Malt is toasted but comes off strangely with the herbal stink lingering to it. 		Body is thin but passable for many lager styles, carbonation is way up fortunately, producing that nice head and a little relief on the palate from the otherwise very bad flavor. Trust the other reviews and avoid if possible. I'm sad that I bought a sixer, although it was mercifully cheap.";0;0;;1
645;"Poured from a bottle a deep clear red amber with a small white head and a minimal amount of lacing on the glass.		Aroma is rich with malts and alcohol. I haven't experienced many beers that smell as strong as Devil Dancer.		The taste is sharp and bright with the warmth of the alcohol quickly coming through and nearly overpowering the malts. A drying hops presence brings some bitterness and pine to the finish.		Mouthfeel is warm, smooth, yet also sharp with a modest carbonation.		This definitely a beer to enjoy casually and in no rush. Very nice, but I wish the alcohol was pushed back a little. I know, that's hard to do with a 13% abv.";1;1;;1
646;"Tasted at CBC on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Draft into a 13 oz. tulip. 		This one isn't exactly a looker: pours a turbid, murky copper brown. There's little to no head, and I can't really muster anything even after a vigorous swirl of my glass. 		Pretty rich nose, which is impressive for a beer this low in ABV. I'm immediately struck by the depth of the caramel aromas, which are complimented by butterscotch and toffee. This is one malty beer, with little to no hop presence in the smell.		The taste, unfortunately, doesn't quite live up to the aroma. There are some caramel flavors, but curiously enough I'm struck by an overwhelming (for the ABV, at least) and persistent bitterness. In the back end, there's a harsh astringency. A particular yeast flavor that I associate with many CBC beers really struggles to come through. There's flavor here, but it is pretty one-dimensional and a little off-putting. 		The mouthfeel is certainly on the thin side, even accounting for how sessionable this is. Borderline watery, with inadequate carbonation, this was surprisingly unrefreshing.		Compared to something like Stone Levitation (which I'd deem more than roughly analogous, style-wise), this is a pretty substandard offering. Given the fantastic summer beers CBC puts out (I'm looking at you, Arquebus), this is doubly disappointing. A rare miss from this brewery, but a miss nonetheless.";0;0;;1
647;"y wife actually deemed this a ""destination beer"" because it is not available in St. Louis. Thankfully, you can take a short trip across the river into Illinois and pick some up. As the name implies, you could drink it for breakfast. It is almost like a glass of coffee with some chocolate if your coffee was 8.3% ABV. It has more body than a lot of stouts. While you won't sit and drink a lot of these at one sitting, you will want to start off with this truly amazing beer.";0;0;;1
648;"Nearly black pour with a thin film of quick-receding dark tan head. Aroma dominated by slightly bitter espresso and just a trace of cocoa.		Moderate carbonation and a thick, creamy mouthfeel. Huge coffee flavors strike a nice bitter-roasty balance. Subtle chocolate character emerges before a more bitter espresso finish.		Great heft to this beer and lots of coffee character, although it drinks lighter than its 8.3%.";1;1;;1
649;"Bottle 12oz,bottled on date 04/01/09. A pretty light Mars red color body with a thin soapy head that fades rather quickly,leaving some spotty lacing,lots of soft carbonation. Aroma is of ripe cherries and a wheaty malt,and a very subtle funk type yeast note. Flavor is slightly sweet up front with a bit of carbonation wash and then a some nice wheat flavors, followed by the tart cherries,leaving a nice sweet cherry Jolly Rancher type flavor on your lips,cherry in the finish ,not super complex but has layers of flavors that fit togeather nicely.Fruit Beer is not my favorite style,especially if too tart, but this stuff is very good,very drinkable .		 Thank You Founders";1;1;;1
650;"Amber/orange in color and topped with a white head is how this beer appeared upon serving.	Smelled like baked bread, yeasty.	The taste starts out bland, then I picked up a piney, resinous taste from the hops. Finish is dry.	Mouthfeel is watery. No real body to speak of here.	Drinkability is low on this beer for me. I felt like I was drinking a watered down hop tea.";0;0;;1
651;"Poured a fluffy off-white head on top of a clear reddish brown beer.		Smells like dish soap with caramel malt underneath.		The redeeming quality of the taste is a slightly burnt coffee finish. Most of the time though it just seems like something is off in this, like the grains were old, or low-grade. 		Carbonation must have taxed inself on the head because there isn't much to liven things up. Medium body.		I'm pouring the rest of this out, it's flat, the taste is off and it smells soapy .";0;0;;1
652;"Pours a dark brown with an average sized head that quickly goes away. Smell is very spicy, with a hint of tea and some dark maltiness. It has a medium mouthfeel to it but it is way too spicy for my liking. There is also a lot of smokiness in the beer which makes it tough to put down and leaves a bad taste in my mouth.		An interesting take on a brown ale but one that I wouldn't care for again.";0;0;;1
653;Ruby red color with a cream colored head leaving spotty lacing around the glass. Toffee, brown sugar, malted milk balls in the nose. Malted milk balls up front followed by toffee in the finish, only a bit of hop presence. Average carbonation and medium bodied. Wasn't very drinkable, split the bottle. Perhaps I will try it again to see if I got a bad bottle or if I will like it better.;0;0;;1
654;"Crystal clear, pale yellow color, faint fizzy head, soon to dissipate...there goes my notion that the phrase ""extra stout beer"" on the label might mean what it usually does...		Aroma: empty and acrid, not unpleasant, but fairly faint...a little corny, squeaking alcohol, oily, greasy, ...feels like I'm in for another Eastern European malt liquor in this one...		Taste: blah...blech...bluh...nothin' doin' here...high borne maltitude, but little ballast below it...very lightness of body for such a high amplitude of alcohol, as I'm sure I'm about to encounter...damn, but I had my hopes up for a real and true Lithuanian Stout, such things are possible, after all, but it was not to pass...		This is just a stirring, stinging, but ultimately bereft of character kind of brew...it's a killer diller, with not a grace note of kindness among it's bag...		I guess ""extra stout"" just means ""extra strong"" ....9.5% is awfully extra...but I need more flavor...kind of like a malt liquor, but not as bland or as punishing as American versions...		I feel cheated, though...took my bottle home, thinking I had a Lithuanian Imperial Stout waiting for me...alas, and alack...		...can't recommend it... nosirree...";0;0;;1
655;"12oz bottle poured into snifter.		Pours pitch black, sludgy, chunky with rust colored head that lingers & faint sticky lacing on the glass.		Smells of bourbon obviously, along with expresso, leather, tobacco, plum, and wet wood. Delightful.		Tastes like burnt expresso & a shot of bourbon. Very warm, but not hot. Blind, I would think someone gave me chilled expresso with a shot of whiskey. I think that's a good thing.		Feels warm, smooth, & boozy. You can feel the 10% for sure. 		Very drinkable for the style & ABV. Probably a good thing I don't have easy access to this.		I enjoyed this much more than the Breakfast Stout. I could have 2+ of these easy, & I can't say that about FBS. More complex and not as chocolatey. This is going to be a staple on my wants list for awhile. If you enjoy imperial stouts or barrel beers, especially stouts, you owe it to yourself to find this one. Get some if you can.";1;1;;1
656;Color is golden orange. It has a white head that dissipates very quickly. It appears to be very carbonated as I see lots of effervescence. I can smell some malts and it has an aroma similar to a pilsner lager. Bitterness is the first thing I noticed after tasting--and it totally overpowers the malts. The bitterness isn't pleasant and leaves a lingering aftertaste. I'm really curious about what variety of hops were used, as the IBU rating of 35 is relatively low. After it warmed up, the bitterness was even more pronounced. Body is very light and when combined with the carbonation, it reminds me very much of a pilsner lager.;0;0;;1
657;A message on the front label says something to the affect that it's the oldest Kloster brewery in the world having made beer since 1050. Goldish colored label on a 0.5L bottle that has a feaky Mozart looking man leaning over a wall towards the bottom of the label. Interesting tidbit, the O.G. Is listed on the back in fine print as being between 1074 and 1078. Best before December 7th. On to the good part. Poured a solid, chestnut colored head that faded slowly leaving four specs of lace. Dark cola colored beer is almost black, and the edges glow like moltent caramel. Aroma is very sweet. Lots of caramel and plums. Aroma reminds me of the taste of Samiclaus. It doesn't taste as sweet as the aroma suggest. The dry bitterness of dark malts cuts the sweet caramel maltyness. There are hints of cocoa along with cherries and plums. Moderately full mouthfeel, but nothing too much. It's not so thick you need to wash it down. A tasty beer with a rich aroma. A little different the most doppelbocks, and worth keeping an eye out for.;1;1;;1
658;"Tap Duckworths Balantine. Very dark brown not quite black. Just a ring of white.		Aroma, fair amount of roast, dark chocolate. Some coconut shell.		Taste, large amount of earthy roast malt, coffee, some peat. Accenting coconut. Roast and cocoa linger.		Just to the light side of medium, but coats ok. Pretty roasty and dry, if you like that it will be no problem to drink.		Pretty solid regular lineup brew.";1;1;;1
659;Eh, this beer just never came together for me. Pours soft, thick looking, not much head to speak of despite me trying to build one up. Yes, there is lots of flavor in this beer. Chocolate cake, dark fruits, a touch of coffee maybe, but it never really gets deep. And despite my initial impression on the pour this beer doesn't really have a lot of body to it to hold everything together. At times it kind of tasted like flavored sugar water, unfortunately. Was hoping for more but this just seemed like a confused beer to me.;0;0;;1
660;Is this one of those beers that I should pretend to like? Afterall, it has a high ABV, it's a dark burnt amber in color, and the label/name is cool. The name is actually quite accurate in my opinion...tastes dirty. The smell is truly horrendous. If you let it sit for a few minutes and let the fumes build up in the glass before you take a wiff, wow, it is not pleasant. I think that's what did it for me: the smell. It's a hard to drink beer, but you plunge through it because you paid $10 for a sixer. It would be a challenge to choke down more than one of these tonight. As I work my way to the bottom, the smell is seeming to dissipate somewhat, which helps a tad on drinkability. Sorry, this will never be in my fridge again. I think I'll go have the Samichlaus I've been saving for 2 years.;0;0;;1
661;"Thanks to Alex for pulling this oddity out.		A - There's a hop cone in here, and they warn you that it ""may"" be in there on the bottle. It's an orangish, brownish color, with some distinct, thick, and pronounced lacing. Kind of a nice look, not super intricate, but noticable. Few hop leaves fell into my glass.		S - Tropical fruits, although somewhat strange, pine and citrus are there, but not super citrusy. Sweeter smelling IPA.		T - I don't really like this, taste of strange butter, almost tropical fruits, and sugar that's more sweet, but somehow not sugary sweet. With the amount of sweetness in it, I was expecting some burn from the alcohol, but that was thankfully not present. Still, this tastes bizzare and not good.		M - Medium bodied, a little jammy, moderate carbonation.		D - This beer doesn't taste repulsive, but somehow I couldn't bring myself to get through more than about 1/2 my glass. I just flat out didn't like the taste. Would not drink this again.";0;0;;1
662;"A: Bright, clear gold color. Poured a 3 finger stark white head that fell immediately to an even skim. Decanted vigorously. No lacing.		S: Wet grain. Faint sweet. Maybe a slight grassiness (but I probably imagined it).		T: Crackery malt that's dry and crisp. Transitions to hay and cut grass in the in a finish where it all lingers a little unpleasantly.		M: Light body. Ample carbonation; very active in the glass and on the palate. Crisp and dry but a bit too much aftertaste to be refreshing.		O: Less than ordinary but nothing was horribly wrong.";1;0;;0
663;This beer looked interesting enough as an extra...at least the bottle did. Poured a brownish copper with a thin off-white head that faded quickly. Smell was nothing that reminded me of a beer, massive chocolate and hints of cherry. Both seemed somewhat artificial, though the bottle says with natural flavors added. The taste was interesting but only for a sip or two. I thought the flavor seemed too much like a candy drink and not enough like a beer. Thin, watery mouthfeel. I wouldn't drink more than one of these and it was actually tough for me to get through just one. Not a bad idea but I believe it could have been done much better.;0;0;;1
664;"Pours a nice clean and clear amber color with a rather large 2 inch slightly yellowed head. Good retention and some nice lacing is also present.		The aroma is decent. A bit of raw grain, with some fruity esters. There's a touch of sugar and some really nice floral notes. It's a very pleasing aroma. 		The taste is ok. There's some raw grain, haylike quality. It's slightly bitter as well. It's earthy, and kind of herbal. Not too bad.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated.		Drinkability is fairly high.

665;"Poured In: Tulip Glass	Purchased At: Steve's Liquor (Madison, WI)		Appearance: Whew, baby, this one is made out of pennies. A very rich copper color with very little light making its way through the glass. A finger of head on the top that dissipates rather quickly. I'm left with a very thin layer of oily head with some small bubbles. These oils are a good sign.		Smell: I wasn't expecting this strong of an aroma from this APA. It looks like this is going to have a fairly good hop presence. A nice blend of grapefruit and orange peel.		Taste: This doesn't happen often. The nose misled me. While this beer does have a well rounded hop profile, I was expecting a bit more citrus on the tongue based on what the nose gave me. A little bit of grapefruit and orange peel with a dash of mango, followed with some grass, pine, and soil.		Mouthfeel: Wow. The hop oils coating my teeth, gums, and tongue is wonderful. I wasn't expecting this out of an ""APA"". A lovely feeling in the mouth after it trickles down the back of my throat.		Drinkability: This is a great beer, and more worthy than what fellow BA's have given it. This will end up in my crate again.";1;1;;1
666;"Gave this one an aggressive pour into a goblet and almost overflowed. Nice one and a half inch head the color is light tan while the beer is a dark brown, almost black.		Smells musty, like freshly overturned sod with hints of chocolate malt.		Tastes metallic, roasted chocolate and burnt coffee. Just a hint of hops in the finish.		This one is thin in the mouth, but has good lacing. It's hanging on the sides for dear life.		The drinkability is good due to the thin mouthfeel. Overall I have had better bottles of this brew. This one tastes a little off compared to previous bottles. Generally speaking this is a decent Porter and worth buying.";1;0;;0
667;Pours pitch-black, like motor oil, with a very tiny cream head. This one looks extremely thick, and the taste does not differ. Smell is very strong of coffee and mocha. It has a very full mouthfeel to it and tastes of a combination of coffee, heavy espresso, oats, bourbon, alcohol, and maybe a touch of vanilla. The flavors mellow together very nicely. This is a very smooth drinker, but a really full beer that will take you a couple of extra minutes to finish. It leaves a strong trace of alcohol, so I will definitely be aging a couple of these to see how they develop over time. If this style of beer interests you, this is definitely one of the best.;1;1;;1
668;"Pours nutbrown, cloudy, with off white head. Head is thin butreluctant to disappear enitrely, thinly covering surface through most of consumption. Smells like hops, fresh and clean. Taste is well defined hoppiness quickly followed by alcohol coming out in the back of mouth and soon followed by stong citrus rind bitter feeling. The bitter atertaste is mostly gone in about 15 seconds. Mouthfeel is fine, tangy and cleansing of previous flavors. Doesn't overpower food flavors, this is an acceptable amount of bitterness to pair with saucy Chinese (my current meal).		This is a slow drinking beer, but not quite complex enough to merit sipping. There's not much masking of the alcohol in this brew which both limits it's drinkability but contributes nicely to the flavor This beer is definately worthy of comparison to your favorite strong IPA.";1;0;;0
669;"On-tap at Haymarket for d0b's birthday bash. Served in a 12oz tulip.		A - A thin white foam settles some wisps and a thin ring of bubbles, leaving behind minimal lace. Transparent golden body.		S - Wheat, Belgain yeast, lightly phenolic, toasted grains, some fruity esters and lemony notes. Good amount of punch for only 4.5%.		T - The taste is initially fairly mild, but it grows as the beer cross the palate with notes of bread, wheat, toasted grains, and a bit of lemony hop, finishing with a hefty does of tangy Belgian yeast.		M - Light body that's a tad watery, particularly with the lower carbonation. Texture has a bit of chaffed wheat to it. Nothing unexpected from a table beer.		D - It's a nice session/table beer. Taste is surprisingly solid and potent for the low alcohol content, and the Belgian yeast character is well-integrated and pleasant.";1;1;;1
670;"Bought this at a small liquor store in the Capitol area of DC. Popped in to grab a decent 6er for a friend I was visiting and saw this, knew it was meant to be.		A: Rich, creamy. Very dark body with a thick, yet fluffy, white head. When people talk of Guinness as a beer-milkshake, they have clearly never encountered a FBS.		S: Coffee. Chocolate. This is an oatmeal stout, technically, but it's all coffee and chocolate. If mochas smelled like this, I would spend all my money at Starbucks.		T: Better than the aroma. It is truly a breakfast itself. All coffee to begin with, then all chocolate at the end. Honestly, this is the perfect balance for someone who loves both flavors (as I do). The coffee provides a deep roasted flavor, but no bitterness. Then the chocolate swoops in to counter that deep roasted flavor with a sweet - but not sugary - chocolate.		M: Perfect. It is thick and fulfilling, but not so thick as to prevent one from having more than one. There is a thickness in feel but a lightness on the tongue. Another perfect balance struck. It's over 8%, but there's not booze to it.		O: There isn't anything else to say about this beer. I could drink this beer at any meal, any season of the year (although, a cold morning paired with some maple syrup oatmeal would make for the perfect start of a day).";1;1;;1

673;Very good social drinking beer. Not too heavy or filling. The head dissipates quickly, leaving a pretty amount of lace. The color is a mild gold and the smell is a bit weak.

674;"Enjoyed on nitro-tap at the 2011 KBS release with my good friend TCGoalie.		Nitro KBS is served up an inky black with a nice tan head that has great retention. It pretty much looks like normal KBS but with a bit more of a whipped head.		The aroma is quite different and a bit muted. Luckily, it is muted in a good way. The alcoholic nature of the bourbon and the astringency of the roasty malts and coffee give way a bit to a nice toffee and chocolate sweetness with a bit of vanilla mixed in. It is a much friendlier nose that is not necessarily better or worse than normal, just pleasantly different.		The flavor is quite similar to normal draft KBS, but still seems a bit less intense. Coffee, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, toffee and molasses are all present, as is a decent hotness.		The mouthfeel is super smooth and velvety, making this stuff dangerously drinkable. The finish is sweet and slightly roasty as well as seemingly toned down just like the aroma and flavor.		I enjoy KBS no matter what form it is in and this glass is no different. If I had to choose between only having draft or nitro the rest of my life, I would probably take draft KBS. However, if I see nitro available I will surely go for it as delicious and hard to find treat.";1;1;;1

676;This, in my opinion, was a very enjoyable beer. Fairly light in color, slightly reminds me of a witbeer. When poured correctly has a nice just off-white head that does not last very long, but does not disappear too quickly either. Very smooth brew with a very nice mouthfeel.;1;1;;1
677;"A new coffee brew from Founder's, guess what? It is freakin' awesome!		A-The deepest, darkest brown with a crazy, creamy tan head that reduced oh so slightly and produced nice lacing.

679;From a cask at BRBP. Served in a smaller flute. Appears deep brown, with some ruby highlights. Thin beige head disappears very quickly. Strong toffee, malty nose. Not much hop aroma. Very pleasant caramel, toffee flavors. Very low bitterness. Carbonations very soft, as you would expect for a cask beer. Noticable alcohol in the finish. Not overly sweet, but also not as robust as I had hoped. Event though the mouthfeel was soft, it seemed a bit thin for a beer of this magnitude. Overall, very enjoyable and went well with the excellent scotch eggs.;1;0;;0
680;A very typical beer. I purchased this often in Europe because it was cheaper then most while still offering a drinkable liquid. Pours a little head that dissapates quickly.

683;"As I travel around this great world I like to taste the local beers. Being that was in O'Fallon, I figured that I'd have an O'Fallon Gold. 		That was probably not the best idea that I had today. 		The beer poured into the pilsner glass and looked quite good; a nice rich darkish golden color. That is where this beer's good points ended. There was no smell to speak of and there was no taste to speak of. It has less flavor and body than say the St. Louis staple, Bud Light. 		Weak head. 		NO FLAVOR to speak of. If you concentrate, maybe you can detect a whisper of hops followed by a hint of malt.		I can't say that it tasted bad because it didn't taste like anything at all. It was a complete waste of time. 		I guess that it's a beer for people who want to look like they are driking something good but don't really like the taste of good beer????		I'm not sure how this place stays in business.

685;Very delicious imperial stout. Pours a dark black color with a caramel colored head. Has an aroma of bourbon with hints of coffee, vanilla, and malt. The alcohol comes through on the smell and taste. This stout has it all sweet and malty on the front, bitter and biting alcohol on the back. Thin mouthfeel. Notes of vanilla and coffee which linger on the tongue through the finish. This is most definitely a snifter worthy stout.;1;1;;1
686;"Dark ruby, with a thick rocky tan head, medium diminishing and leaving decent lace. Aroma is that of a smoke house - smokey sweet bbq sauce.

My first smoked beer, I think I will have to look for more in this style.	Loses points for drinkability, as I don't think I would want more than one in a sitting.";0;0;;1
687;"Excellent beer. It poured completely black into a pint glass with a nice dark brown, mocha head. Laced down fairly nicely, but just a little too quick. Smell up front is of vanilla, oak, chocolate, roasted coffe, and charred oats. Wonderful! Taste is more of the same of the smell. The roasted coffee shining through for me. I could not get over how well the coffee and chocolate taste melded with the bourbon and oak tastes. The coffee would hit you up front with a delicate taste of bourbon coming at the end. Velvety smooth mouthfeel with just the right thickness. Perfect for mouthfeel, in my opinion. Even with the 10%, I could drink this all night long, so the drinkability was great. 		Lived up to every bit of the hype and I am just glad I got to try this before it all got gone. Founders did a really good job with this and I just hope they do more batches in the future.	Highly Recommended!!";1;1;;1
688;"This beer was had on tap at Beer Sellar in Nashville, TN which was as forgettable an experience as the beer was.		Appearance of this brown ale was nearly clear in its browness with a thin head that disappeared shortly after being served. Not exactly shocking for the style, but the better browns I've had over the years have a certain creaminess to the head.		Aroma? What aroma? No one's home. Maybe a whiff of malt but that's about it.		The taste was as lackluster as everything else about this beer. Maybe the lines weren't clean and spoiled the stuff. This one tastes like any watery brew you've never liked.		As to mouthfeel, get the paddles 'cause this one's flatlined. 		It's drinkable, but not recommended by me anyway. If I ever get the opportunity, I'll give it another chance, probably in bottle form.

696;"Part of the ""Barrel Aged Family Reserve"" series		Pours a slightly hazy gold with little head and no lacing. Aroma is interesting with a strange mix of light malty biscuit and butter with a decent bourbon note and a strong hint of alcohol. The flavor is strong, very strong bitter flavor along with a bit of creamy malt flavor. The bourbon then kicks in hard and leaves a strong mouthfeel. Mouthfeel is rough, harsh and relatively unenjoyable.		Overall, could use some more time to mellow out but not a beer I would endeavor to track down again.";0;0;;1
697;"Basically black with a small beige head. 		Small lacings, but the beer reacts beautifully when the glass is swirled. 		The aroma is intense - lots of fat malts, molasses, smooth bourbon, dough, and maple syrup. The character is heavy, but it's still fresh and alive. Great integration in the nose. 		The taste is almost unbelievable. The body is beyond full and the mouthfeel is beyond smooth and creamy - this is like cream covered in velvet. It is nicely carbonated, which is very delightful. Lovely sweet malty flavor with s smooth bitter accompanying roastiness. Notes of coffee. The barrel character is flawless . smooth toned-down nutty bourbon with hints of wood and vanilla, and sweet fresh maple syrup with hints of honey. A noticeable bitterness develops towards the finish as the beer ends with caramel, toffee, powdery coffee and a hint of alcohol. 		This is, from start to finish, a very well made beer. Ridiculously complex, perhaps bordering what is possible with beer without it collapsing in a mess. Here, instead we get great balance and integration. I must say that I find it interesting that the barrel aging made its mouthfeel so full compared to the regular Breakfast stout. Well well, to sum it up: this might be the best barrel aged imperial stout I've ever had.";1;1;;1
698;"Poured from a bottle into my Duvel tulip glass.		Smell: This was immediately noticeable and the first thing to strike me. The beer smells like smoked meat. Worchestire and liquid smoke. This will either be really bad, or surprisingly good. I'll try to rate it based on what this style is supposed to be, not personal preference.		Appearance: Dark like a dopplebock, ruby brown in color, practically no head, no lacing. The beer leaves a film when swirled, as if there will be a lot of sugary malts.		Taste: Have you ever had baby back pork ribs grilled over an open beach fire? Thats what this beer tastes like. It's semi sweet, very smokey. The taste and immediate aftertaste would be fine if the longer aftertaste didn't leave a lingering bitterness that seems out of place with the smoothe smoke and sweeter foretaste.		Mouthfeel: Average. It's a bit bubbly, nothing special nor horrible.		Drinkability: I won't finish this bottle. This is either a taste I have not yet acquired, or the beer itself just isn't enjoyable enough. I'll likely try the style again in the future to see if I like it more, but this one is mediocre at best.";0;0;;1
699;"Had on tap at Founders tap room. 		I was really hoping this beer would be on tap when we arrived. 		The appearance was nothing special. A muddy brown color. The aroma was heavenly.

Typical flavors of a nut brown ale, dark bread, molasses. Then a perfect amount of bourbon and maple with a long, sweet, oaky, finish. Good stuff. The mouthfeel was okay, I would have liked it to be a little fuller. 		Overall another great beer from Founders. Anything they put in Maple Bourbon barrels is magic.";1;1;;1
700;"This is my first real IPA, and I must say I've enjoyed it!		Appearance - it poured a nice golden/orange colour, slightly murky, and without much head. I must say I expected some more head, but I'm not complaining.		Smell - it smelled of grains, a little alcohol cutting through, and some floral, almost plant like smell at the end - the only thing I can compare it to would be the smell of the grape vines I cut up at work when I prune them.		Taste - I don't think I've had a beer that's quite as complex as this - it starts off with some citrus, as well as some toasty notes. It then goes into a bit of a ""peppery"" almost spiciness, then follows into some lingering bitterness and sweetness, which sticks in the mouth a little bit.		Mouthfeel - I've had some heartier beers, but it did feel a little thick and hearty, it had a good level of body to it. Medium to low carbonation as well.		Overall - I have to say it is quite the beer, the only thing I don't really like about it is the alcohol flavour, it just makes me think of nail-polish remover. I've really enjoyed it, and I would recommend it to be had with something very hearty and with sharp flavours that can compete with the bitterness and the alcohol flavour. The alcohol flavour is actually quite the deterrent to me, I can't really stand the alcoholic zang at the end of the beer, I think that's the only improvement that can be made.

It's the trio of cherry, chocolate, and beer that makes this one different. 		I would most liken the initial nose to that of a Scotch Ale, but with some slightly musty odors.

A slight bitterness that tastes like a slightly bitter chocolate. The warmer it gets the more tastes start popping out with some signs of sweeter chocolate starting to peak through. The oatmeal isn't really jumping out at me... It seems more like a few different nutty and oat flavors combining for an ""oatmeal like"" taste, rather then an actual oatmeal taste.

Notes: My third Founders in as many days with KBS and Dirty Bastard coming before this. All three of them have been incredible for me and I've truly enjoyed what they've each uniquely brought to the table in their respective styles.

710;I've never been a big lover of German Pilsners so this low rating shouldn't reflect on this brew but it does reflect my tastes on this style.

It's a clear yellow brew with the flavors and aromas mentioned above. Just not my favorite.;0;0;;1
711;"Chilled and poured into a Duvel glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. 		Appearance: The beer pours out a cherry wood or copper color with a "" off white head that recedes fairly soon to a ring around the glass and a patch or two of foam. Although the liquid is clear it is dark enough that no light gets through the glass. Sipping leaves lots of fine speckled lacing and the lacing continues for most of the beer.		Smell: The aroma contains grapefruit hops with pine resin notes and spicy rye along with some nice light toffee or rich caramel malt.		Taste: The flavor is predicted from the aroma. The grapefuit and pine and spicy rye all put in an appearance. The malt sweetness is and remains in the background but is clearly present none the less.		Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium to light-bodied and silky smooth. The carbonation is fairly light and hard to pick up as more than a gentle prickling sensation on the tongue. The finish is medium to long, beginning with some malt that soon waves good-bye and leaves the playing field to the hops and the rye which continue to blend together and slowly just disappear.		Drinkability: Now this is a drinkable beer. I like the way the finish leaves me wanting another sip. For me this is a beer I could have 2 or 3 of in an evening and I will definitely add this one to my shopping list to get more for the future. This is also a beer that blurs the boundaries between a rye beer and a PA and an IPA. It is hopped like an IPA, it contains rye, and it is called a PA by the brewery.";1;1;;1

714;"Apparently the brewpub has revived a beer they formerly retired, because it was on tap there on January 12, 2006. Listed in the menu as follows:	ABV -- 10.5%	IBU -- 31.3		Appearance was a light amber with some haziness, but no head -- I don't know why, but they draw all their beers here with virtually no head.		Smell was intense, complexe malty and hoppy mix, with a note of bubble gum. Fascinating.		Taste was harsh, heavy syrupy. Reminded me over overly hopped cough syrup. Not so pleasant.		Mouthfeel, by contrast, was rich and lovely. 		Drinkability was, of course, low -- they acknowledge that by serving this 10-and-a-halfer in half-pints only.		An odd brew, all over the place.";0;0;;1
715;"Poured into a Bruery tulip. Served at approximately 50 degrees. Sick extra from Kelly88.		Heavy handed pour produces a finger of off white head with mostly tiny bubbles tight concentration and bigger bubbles on the top. Dark ruby color bordering on brown. Can't see through this one, no light getting through. Initial head dies down to a bubbly layer of foam around the edge and a slim layer of foam on the surface. Some oily legs, but not oily enough to pull spots of lacing back into the beer.		Smells is of oaky vanilla, boozy bourbon, raisins, figs, and sweet caramel malts. Nutty/fruity bourbon notes reveal themselves with some agitation as the brew warms. Comparisons to a bourbon barrel aged old ale would make sense based on the nose. Very enticing.		Taste is comprised of boozy bourbon up front that melts into oaky vanilla which quickly transforms into toasted caramel malts that end on a boozy nutty bourbon note with a resin/leafy hop bitterness. Bitter nutty flavor lingers on the palate.		High end of medium bodied, flavors aren't super rich which is one of my only complaints with this beer. Low carbonation. A bit coating, but not to syrupy/thick. Slightly hot on the way down.		I could definitely knock back a few of these without being overwhelmed or getting sick of it.";0;0;;1
716;"Opaque dark orange rust with pillowy and dense head. Hazing from hop AND hemp oil? Plus rye can get gummy so I would feel safe calling this one unfiltered, which earns it a +1.		Earthy and lemony in aroma, toasted honey wafers, a little tart with not too much of a hop presence. Smells good, but where are the hops? This is an American Red with the word hop in the title, right?		Wood musk, lemon, some light toffee, and a bacteria-like tartness ( think greek style yogurt). The malt has a full bodied flavor like honey toast while the hops are good on bitterness, but more subdued and supportive then one would suspect from the title. I suspect that the hemp lent a supportive role to the grain and might be what's giving it that honey taste. Did they toast some hemp? Just use the seeds? ???		Full-bodied and heavy on the palate. A session beer that will make you think you are drinking something heavier in alcohol and at 5.5% that means I drink slower and drink longer which suits me fine.		A fine sessioner. Interesting taste, texture and bouquet. Would like to try it on draft somewhere. I guess gimmick beers can also boast integrity.";1;1;;1

S: After pouring, the skunky smell is evident from pretty far away. Euro lager smell. A lot of must and some grainy sourness. Old grain.		T: Rough and grainy with the taste of whole grain crackers... like triscuits or something. Finishes slightly sour with a lasting impression of skunk and must that is not altogether pleasant.		M: Crisp on the tongue and going down alright.		D: Not a big fan and not looking to drink a bunch of these. Kind of off-ish taste, but I have a feeling it's intentional.";0;0;;1
718;"Revisiting this one courtesy of kmpitz2. Pours a golden yellow orange with a big cragly two finger head on top. Strong aromas of floral hops that actually smelly soapy. A hint of citrus is there as well...but the odd soapy fragarance is just off putting to me. 		First sip brings a nice pale, bready maltiness along with a very floral, citrusy dirty hoppiness. The floral aspect is overpowering and again reminds me of soap..something I'd rather not have in my beer. An interesting pale ale that really doesn't do anything for me.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation. This is easy to drink but the particular flavor profile doesn't have me going back for more. The first Founders offering that I've been less than pleased with.";0;0;;1

Flavors are thin, weak and watery. In fact, it tastes a bit like coffee rinse water. No bad; just tastes like coffee water. 		This bottle is purportedly from 2010.

720;Not typically available in Alberta, but the Horseman Liquor Store here in Airdrie has had it in stock for as long as I can remember. Okocim Mocne poured with a very sizable styrofoam-white head, and with respectable creaminess. It churned very slowly and left small pockets of lace. Later the foam settles to a good layer and stays put. The beer is dark honey, and very clear. The aroma is...interesting, definitely sweetish maltiness like some North American malt liquors, but this at least has some nuances. Grassy malt, syrupy alcohol, but also some yeasty fruity smells. Faint dusty hops and grain, minus the adjuncts of malt liquor. The 7.8% is not overly powerful, and despite the taste being pretty bland, the alcohol does give an astringency like malt liquors either. Light grain, sourish syrup, distant hopping in the finish. Not bad as a strong lager actually, just not very drinkable. The sugary malting gets a bit much towards the end. The mouthfeel is quite light, and the carbonation low, adding the to syrupy feel of the beer. Worth trying as an all malt strong beer.;0;0;;1
721;"Received it in a trade and am glad to finally try this beast!		Pours a SOLID black. A little brown around the edges and a nice little tan head.		The smell is probably the best part of this beer. Lots off chocolate but smoothed out by slight vanilla/oak and a hint of coffee.		The taste is mainly of chocolate with just the right amount of oak on the back as well as some alcohol. 		The mouthfeel is fairly thick but not to syrupy.		Damn fine beer and lives up to the hype unlike others I've had.";1;1;;1
722;"Pours a nice, rich golden color with a decent cream head.		The smell...well, it lacks. I'm honestly not sure what I'm picking up here, but whatever it is, it's not much.

I really hope it's the last.";0;0;;1
723;"Bottle into Erdinger pint glass in low altitude Galway, Ireland.		A: Pours a thin head with little cream, of fair retention. Hazy but transparent light copper colour. Generally appealing. 		Sm: The usual suspects: malt, hops, barley. Something else my broken nose can't place. Smell is generally overrated on beeradvocate anyway (I mean come on; smell is worth twice what mouthfeel is?). 		T: Very interesting body, atypical for the style. The usual suspects are all there, but balanced alongside a strangely citric note. The choice of hops was a unique one for the brew, but I don't know that its working in its favour. The usual bitterness of English pale ales is lacking, but I think it complements the taste better. The finish is a crisp fruit peel/honey hybrid taste that matches the body, but still feels lopsided. Difficult to discuss the taste in the context of this style. The notes blend very murkily, creating a bland effect. 		Mf: Far too dense especially for the ABV. Almost a syrupy consistency that weighs down on the palate when the taste doesn't merit it. A bit too much malt was added in primary. The crispness on the finish is nice, but far from enough to save it. 		Dr: It's unremarkable. Make the individual notes more distinct and it might work, but as is, this brew is best left on the shelf.";0;0;;1
724;"12oz bottle poured into a nonic.		A - jet black like used motor oil with a hint of a dark brown head that in a flash was gone. (as to be expected with bourbon barrel aged beers.)		S - chocolate, roasted barley, tobacco, smoke, charred barley, oak, vanilla. the smell is essentially Breakfast Stout that has a bourbon barrel tinge to it. very coffee heavy.		T - very coffee heavy. coffee, roasted barley, espresso, smoke, tobacco, charred malt. vanilla, oak, and alcohol come into play as the beer warms. there's also some dark chocolate in the finish. Essentially it tastes like sweetened guinness draught that's been bourbon barrel aged, but that's simplifying it too much because it's so much more. 		M - thick and viscous. it appeared to leave a film on my glass.		D - very good beer. I'm glad i picked up a few (seven) extra bottles for cellaring.		Additionally: Does it live up to the hype? Yes. Definitely one to seek out if you're an Imperial Stout fan.";1;1;;1
725;Received this beer from brandoman63, in the brews-n-tunes summer '07 tour.Served at just about cellar temperature in a snifter, from a stubby twelve ounce brown bottle.Poured a deep brownish orange with some ruby highlights. Beer showed up somewhat murky in the glass. About two good fingers of soapy, off-white head rose from the glass. Head had decent retention and left some sticky lace on the glass. Smelled of raisin, plum, cherries, alcohol, and some sweet sugary sweet notes. Hopefully it tastes as good as it smells. Flavors were very fruity. Again, raisin, plum, rum, yeast, candy sugar with a somewhat grainy taste. Also could taste cherries from a can of fruit cocktail. Had a nice full, complex mouthfeel. Left a little bit of an alcohol burn on the back of the tongue. Plenty of carbonation. Very drinkable and enjoyable!;1;1;;1
726;"I had this on-tap at Max's, poured into a tasting glass.		Appearance: Pours a cloudy dark amber color with a layer of off white head and a good amount of lacing.		Smell: It's smokey, but not overly so. There are some herbal notes along with the smoke.		Taste: Like the smell, mild smoke with some herbal notes, a bit grassy. Malt sweetness yields to a somewhat bitter finish.		Mouthfeel: Medium body with smooth carbonation and a slick finish.		Overall: It was nice to be able to taste some other flavors in a rauchbier. Easy to drink, the smoke flavor was complemented well by the other tastes. I would have this one again.";1;1;;1
727;"Intro: 12 oz. bottle poured in a tulip glass and shared with a friend		Appearance: Medium head that recedes quickly to a thin white cap although some lacings stays on the sides, ample carbonation that sticks to the inside of the glass with an almost root beer type of coloring only slightly lighter, more like sarsaparilla.		Smell: Carmel and alcohol smell is the most prominent but there is a bourbon smell that gets stronger. In appearance it reminds me of Old Stock Cellar Reserve by North Coast.		Taste: There is a strong bourbon flavoring with toffee tones. I taste the alcohol but the barrel aging really comes through to make the alcohol blend well with the bourbon flavors.		Mouthfeel: Feel the carbonation on the tongue, lots of fizz in the mouth. There is a lingering aftertaste with a slightly dry stickiness. It is almost astringent; between the dryness and the bourbon and alcohol it pushes the mouthfeel low on the scale, even though I really enjoy the taste.		Overall: With every sip you taste the bourbon. I am a big fan of Old Stock Cellar Reserve and this beer reminds me of the other in many ways. It is balanced with an excellent taste that is as smooth as 25 year old bourbon. Considering the difference in price and overall availability I would visit this beer again, maybe not a staple but certainly a regularly.";0;1;;0
728;"A - Poured a golden yellow with a 1.5cm head. Head was gone in a few minutes and not much lacing.		S - Not that intense of a smell, grainy and yeasty. 		T- Hop flavor is significant,, bitterness is high		M-Low carbonation, light bodied.		D: Not the best Euro lager out today.";0;0;;1

Mainly tropical fruits with a touch of pine too. 		T- Taste is again quite a bit of hops going on here. Not a super hop bomb. Has a bigger malt back bone than I expected too. 		M- Medium in body and carbonation.		D- I found this one pretty easy to drink.";1;1;;1
730;"A- Poured from the bottle with a medium/dark foamy head, which quickly receded to a haze layer and collar. Little bits of lacing. COMPLETELY opaque dark brown body. 		S- Smells of rich roasted and stewed malts, slight boozy aroma along with impressions of dark fruit. Simple yet elegant.		T- Very complex and rich. As anticipated, the stewed and dark malts are up front, which are quickly met with the dark fruity esters on the midpalate. Some moderate hop bitterness comes into the finish which lingers on the palate with some slightly roasty and estery notes.		M- Thick and chewy- slightly textured from presumed unattenuated sugars. Immense body overall. Delicate carbonation and low astringency.		D- Very quaffable, given the high ABV.";1;1;;1
731;"A: Bright orange-red, almost approaching cherry red territory, with a two finger head (if that), and tons of yeasties floating around in the unfiltered brew.		S: Citrus bomb for sure, but it wasn't an in-your-face explosion. Grapefruit husk, orange, and an assertive amount of hop bitterness led the way.		T: RIDICULOUSLY bitter! I mean it was a total assault on my taste buds and then some. This is what grapefruit would have tasted like had there been no natural sugar or fiberous pulp to soften the blow of the bitterness. The finish was so dry I'm surprised I was still hydrated after one sip. Resinously resinous!		M: Like I said, it was bitter and it was the lingering type. IMO, the only way this brew would have worked for me was if the carbonation was at such a ridiculous level that it cut through and gave cushion to the highly absurd IBU count... but as it stood, the carbonation was moderate at best.		D: I paid $12.99 for this beast. Heck, I could have gone into a Binney's in Chicago and bought a Dreadnaught for less than that and would have been far more satisfied.";0;0;;1
732;"Continuing my DIPA journey. Yum.	Nice fresh sweet citrus and fruity hop aroma. Mild malt backing with a slight grain quality.	Lighter in color. Golden and very clear. Small white head that was never of any size. Mostly fine bubbles creating a white cap, with a scattering of little pimple bubbles. Heavy and dense lacing.	Nice heavier quality to the feel prepares me for hop flavors and bitterness. A seemingly never ending finish of tartness with some enjoyable astringency sucking in my cheeks. Just a touch of malt flavors of sweet fruit up front, but it is very short-lived. Malt also shows with the nice pale malt flavor. The citrus, mild resin/pine, and fresh grass hop flavors present and then blend with the building bitterness and eventually giving in to the rising intensity of the tartness.	This is heavy enough to slow down the drinking some, but light enough to take a nice drink. Ultimately the bitterness slows me down as much to enjoy the flavors as to allow the experience to pass through.	An exceptional DIPA is made by the uniqueness of the experience. This doesn't hold that. This is a very nicely balanced and flavored drink with no apparent problems or issues. I like it.";1;1;;1

736;"I'll confess that it's been years since I actually tried this beer. Oddly enough, it was also in Sharm-El-Sheikh as was one of the previous reviews. I have very fond memories of the culture, the people, the food, and even this beer (though it has little to do with the quality of the beer itself).		Without touching too many specifics I'll detail what I do remember. First off, I have no recollection of the head at all. That's not to say that there wasn't one...I just don't remember.		In Egypt, there were two versions of this beer available: ""local"" and ""export."" One had a red border on the label, the other blue --- don't remember which was which. Local was almost always better.		I remember that it was golden in color, dry, had a thin mouthfeel, and was highly carbonated. In retrospect, it reminded me a bit of Rolling Rock because it had a sort of ""woody"" thing going on. 		We used to joke that it was much better once the pain in your chest from the first one dissipated. Then again, we imitated Marlon Brando from A Streetcar Named Desire everytime we finished one --- so what did we know. (If you didn't get that, you REALLY need to watch some classic movies.)		The main thing to keep in mind, should you ever venture to Egypt and try this out, is that various environmental/cultural factors make proper storage of beer difficult if not unlikely. You are likely to be served something old and flat --- so if the beer is skunked, order another one from another bar before giving up. 		Truly putting the best face possible on America as a whole....some of the guys I was stationed there with had T-shirts made up that said things like ""Stella - What doesn't kill us makes us stronger!"" and ""Stella - Can a million cockroaches be wrong?"" 		T-shirts and cultural insensitivity aside, it wasn't bad when you got a good one, and it was a full dollar cheaper per bottle than Heineken (the only other thing available to us off-post at the time). I won't say it's worth the trip to Sharm-El-Sheikh just to try this beer, but I will say it's worth drinking one of these for the trip to Sharm-El-Sheikh.";0;0;;1

The finish is oily bitterness that lasts until the next sip.		The mouthfeel is fast and medium bodied with a medium to low level of carbonation.		Dangerously drinkable.

Flavor, in contrast, was a bit of a disappointment. It tasted to me like a malted milk ball, cereal-y, and a bit sour. There was also a fair amount of roastiness and chocolate.

Goes down somewhat easy, though, for its alcohol content. The aftertaste it leaves in one's mouth is quite nasty, however - enough to make you nauseous.

741;"22 oz. bomber bottle that has the same picture as every other Hoppin' Frog label, a happy smiling hopping frog toasting a pint of beer. Since this is a wheat ale, all the mugs of beer on the label have a yellow colored liquid inside them. Not only does this label have all the usual stuff (Government warning, address, barcode, etc), but it also has a wealth of information. On the right side it has a nice sized paragraph talking about the style and the beer itself and just below that it is where they list the beer's specifications of 6.0% ABV, 58 OG, 14 FG, and 12 IBU. Don't waste your time looking for any kind of date because Hoppin Frog doesn't date their bottles. 		Appearance: When poured into a Weizen glass, this Wild Frog was a hazy straw color that was mixed in a dash of lemon yellow coloring. It had the usual Hefeweizen tall head of white foam to it. Like every other Hefeweizen, when it receded it left behind a small white film and streaks of white lace around the glass.		Smell: It had a nice ripe banana aroma to it. That ripe banana stuck out as the main aroma of this beer. There's was only a few other aromas behind that and that was a dash of pepper, a few cloves, a pinch of malted wheat, and a touch of citrus fruits and hops. Basically it had a standard Hefeweizen aroma to it, but that ripe banana really stood out.		Taste: I just couldn't get excited over the taste of this beer. There wasn't much to it. The taste was one big mixture of malted wheat, banana, yeast, lemon zest, orange spice, and lightly bitter citrus hops. Not one flavor stood out as being more than average. The taste was stnadard and average at best.		Mouthfeel: It was crispy and light like the Hefeweizen style is suppose to be, but I thought the aftertaste was far too light. The aftertaste was that of malted wheat, citrus hops, and a small touch of banana.		Drinkability: I can't say alot about this beer because there wasn't alot to this beer. I've said this before and I'm going to say it again, it's just a standard American Hefeweizen. There are better and shall I say cheaper alternatives to this one.

S: The nose, even with nine months under its belt, is full of amarillo zestiness. The citrusy aroma is pungent and strong, seeming to have lost none of its edge.		T: The ale's hop body has lost a bit of its bite over time but it still packs a punch. The hop bill is amarillo, with a medicinal flavor underlying the initial citrus grapefruit bite. The hops stay bitter in the palate for a very long time, leaving a lasting finish. Mixed in with the hops is a well-balanced malt body that adds some caramel into the amarillo kick.		M: The more I reflect, this beer is just as potent and flavorful as it was in November. This beer's amarillo profile gives it a great flavor, bitter and medicinal.		D: Wow.

748;"Otro Mundo Red Ale	Coded: VEN.OCT.11 005:15:07	$5.99/16.9 oz @ Total Wine & More, Claymont, DE		Appearance: Clear deep-amber body beneath an inch thick head of creamy bone-white froth. The head retention is good and the lacing is average.		Smell: Quite fruity, but also grassy, mineral-like (crushed granite), and just slightly metallic. It reminds me a little bit of the yeastiness of Whitbread. Fairly complex yeastiness. Piquant, yet pleasant and welcoming.		Taste: The flavor softens the mineral/metallic character found in the nose with a soft layer of doughy malt that's braced by its own darkish-caramel edge. It even suggests burnt sugar. The grassy hops suggested by the nose are still present, but it's really the yeasty fruitiness that commandeers the ship with notes of pear, berries, sweet grape, and apple. Yes, this is a beer driven by the yeast!!! - an ingredient that's been overshadowed lately by brewers who focus more on heavily handed hopping and/or darker and richer, more complex malt bills. It finishes fairly lingering with residual notes of fruit and mineral in a wash of bitterness and grassy hop notes.		Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Fine-bubbled moderate carbonation.		Overall: Although beers like this used to be commonplace, they're now becoming fairly rare. Outside of Briton I'm not sure you'll find anything quite like this. And this is from Argentina? How weird? But OK, I love it!!! It's loaded with flavor and character, and despite the slightly elevated alcohol you could easily have more than one. Well worth seeking out!";0;0;;1
749;"On tap at the Maproom. 	Served in a Schlenkerla glass.	$7.00 for the pour.		This beer is a wonderful clear gold with a creamy finger of head that leaves some whispy lacing.		The nose is soft and sweet smoked malts, hay, grassy hops. 		The taste follows with sweet smoked malts, some earthy hop bitterness, less sticky dank smoke than most of their other beers. It's quite tasty!		Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lower level of carbonation. It's soft and somewhat creamy.		Awesome stuff! Schlenkerla did it again. My glass went down way too easy.";1;1;;1
750;"Bottled Nov 07.	Immense head upon pour. Think it took me 3 or 4 very slow pours to empty the 12oz into the Luettich Balloon. Off white head with a bit of pigmentation settled over about a 5 minute period and left a bit of lacing above pour.	Taste was a bit bitey from carbonation at first, vanilla came across on the sweet side. Upon warming a bit I couldn't get over the resemblance to what a flat Coke Classic would taste like if it went flat and was recarbonated and left warm. Not bad just couldn't get beyond that.	Mouthfeel was pleasant, left slight booze aftertaste.	Not sure I'd drink more than 1 of these in a single sitting.";0;0;;1

753;"500ml into a tulip. Pours a hazy dirty honey. Minimal head receded quickly to none.		Malts and more hops than typical.		Tangy taste, some sour and again more hops than typical.

754;"Pours a deep bronze/copper/rust colour. Slightly hazy. Giant, creamy, tan coloured head lasts forever; right to the end of the beer. Leaves tons of lacing; giant crazy sheets. Next to nitro tap Guinness, this is the greatest lacing I've ever seen.		Smell is huge; malty passionfuit, pineapple, mango, candy. Sharp, spicy, fragrant, floral hops lurk in the background. Quite a nice choice of fragrance hops.		Flavour is also quite big on malt. Caramel, wild berry-like flavours, and a bit of cocoa. Unfortunately this is all punctuated by a sour/spicy flavour. It clashes with the malt in unnatractive manner. Flavouring and bittering hops are awfully weak; finishes with a wussy hoppiness.		Mouthfeel is nice. Medium-bodied, but not mouth coating. Finishes with a creamy sensation.		Can't really laud the drinkability of this beer. Looks and smells phenomenal. Taste, I just can't wrap my tongue around it.";0;0;;1

760;A true classic. What is to be expected from the original pilsner. The perfect combination of taste, smell, drinkability, appearance, and mouthfeel. This is truly the standard by which all pilsner- style beers are, or at least ought to be measured! Cheers!!;1;1;;1
761;2011 bottle poured into nonic. Color is black with brown edges, a bit light in color compared to most double stouts, and a tiny mocha collar. Smells strongly of oak and bourbon, chocolate, some vanilla, some coffee and a bit of alcohol. Taste is mostly oak and bourbon, some chocolate and coffee, roasted malts, light alcohol, very little hop presence, an unfortunate old cardboard taste in there as well. Harsh oak in the finish. Mouthfeel is very watery for the style with a low carbonation. I know people love this beer, but i think it is average at best and would prefer many other stouts, especially at the price.;0;0;;1

Smelt of strongly bubblegum, bananas, sherry, cinnamon and cloves.		Taste was upfront sweet banana, cheap brandy (or more like the European alcohol ""marc"") , cinnamon and cloves, followed by a harsh yeasty barnyard and mold bitterness on a long finish that dies back to a pleasant banana/bubble gum feel. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, fizzy, creamy, moderately astringent, and excessively alcoholic.

Taste kicks off plenty roasty, with a slightly charred, woody flavor accompanied by a little more citrus (lemon) than was in the aroma, and some clove. A little richer on the palate than a typical weizen, with the smoke rounding out and balancing the crispness. Silky smooth on the palate, and a bit juicy. 		This was highly drinkable on its own, however I'd recommend enjoying it with some smoked pork and/or sharp cheese. This would kill with a roast pork n' provolone sammy.";1;1;;1

Pours a brown clear ale in the glass. No retained cap. Looks flat and tastes flat. Poses a halloween trick on the drinker....just what is this?		 It's not a porter....too thin, sweet and undefined. Is it a weak dark ale dressed as a cola or a sugary flat brown ale masquerading as a porter?

Another poor effort by this brewer and at this price a rip off also.";0;0;;1

767;"This one reminds me of ""SNPA light"" haha. totally good, but not in your face at all. A nice light amber/copper with a nice head of foam.

769;Enjoyed this beer for the first time today. The beer had a pleasant aroma and went down smoothly. The ABV of this beer at 9.5 is better than average for what can be found locally and provides a nice kick even after one serving.

773;"My god, this pours like an imperial stout. From the thickness to the color and texture of the head. Even how the head slowly forms from the bottom reminds me of an Imperial stout.

Aroma is a touch musty with some cocoa powder. Light spice nature as well.		Flavor is fantastic. I immediately thought nice dark chocolate. Then some notes of coffee. A touch of mineral flavor at the end. A bitterness lingers, but it appears to be more from the malts vs. hops.. A real dark roasted flavor. 		Creamy and silky mouth feel. Very nice.

774;"It started off real nice. The beer, poured for me at Andy's, came bright yellow topped off by a rather small, brilliant white lacing head. Nose was perfumy from the hops and showed a little malt if you look for it. Pungently floral and perfumy though. Yum. Beer was crisp in the mouth with good carbonation (not overdone). When cold, the grassy, yet perfumy hops clearly were a good match for the adequate malt body providing firm bitterness and a crisp, dry finish. When the beer wasn't very cold is when things turned ugly. The perfumy hop aroma turned soapy in the mouth, and the final sips reminded me of malty dish water.		I really wanted to love this beer. Great pilsners are tough to make and therefore quite rare on the micro scene. IMHO, this one started off good but quickly showed it's flaws.";1;1;;1
775;"Appearance: Dark brown, very little head that disappears to nothing within a minute. Not an auspicious start.		Smell: Very pleasant aroma suggesting a sweet, thick brew		Taste: Awful.

Mouthfeel: Nasty acrid aftertaste that had me reaching for some water to get rid of the awfulness		Drinkability: Verges on the un-drinkable.		It's amazing how a brewery that can produce such wonderful brews (Trade Winds, Wildcat) also puts out something as repulsive as this.

As it warms a bit, molasses comes through...sweet malty brew with some earthiness.		The flavor doesn't disappoint, starting off full of malty goodness. Not too sweet bisquit doughy malt with notes of molasses and vanilla that soon turn tobacco like with oak tannins and some earthy hops.

Fairly full body with active carbonation from start to finish, I didn't see this in the brew on tap which had very subtle carbonation.

779;What a dissapointment. Pours a light golden amber with a tiny head that did stay the same through the entire session. Lacing was average, noticable but nothing great. The smell was of funky hops and caramel. I noticed some spices such as cinnamon as well, maybe nutmeg. A little nature wiff as well.

781;This is probably the plainest, clearest beer I've ever seen. The head dissipated immediately and left no lacing. The smell was dominated by a skunky grainy aroma.

784;"A- Pours a slightly hazy honey color with an average white head which quickly dissipates.	S- Sweet aroma similar to a Helles Bock; honey-like with hints of brown sugar and cotton candy; just a slight herbal hop note.	T- Initial flavor is sweet malt, like the aroma suggested. Unfortunately, the flavor goes downhill from there. An astringent bitterness kicks in along with a distinct alcohol burn, with both sensations lingering in the dry finish.	M- Thin; this is one of the big problems with this beer. For the amount of alcohol and bitterness hops, you need a heavy, malty beer to hold up, and this beer just doesn't have it.	D- Without sufficient body, the drinkability (even by 9.5% ABV standards) takes a hit.		Overall: This beer comes off as a thin-bodied Maibock. Ultimately, this beer shows what happens when you brew a Maibock without a nice, malty backbone, and in the process shows why a nice, malty backbone is essential to a Maibock. Still, it's not a horrible beer and is worth it for the bottle alone.";0;0;;1
785;Golden amber in colour with a perfect craggy head. Not too much going on in terms of aroma. Perhaps a tiny amount of fruit but that is all. The taste was much better.

A: Pours a 1/2 finger of dark tan head resting atop a pure plack beer. The head takes a minute to form, and sticks around for only a couple of minutes. Lacing on the glass is excellent.

Despite that it has some nice characteristics and I enjoy smelling it.		T: Taste is nice and creamy smooth, black coffee is prominent but the most outstanding taste is pure dark 100% cacao chocolate. Since I'm not a fan of dark chocolate this isn't exactly my favorite beer. The creaminess helps balance it though.		M: Really amazing. Nice and creamy, perfectly carbonated for the style, and coats my mouth about as well as any beer.		D: It took me over an hour to finish a 12oz sample, and I couldn't have more than one due to the bitter finish of this one.		I think I will revisit this beer in a few years as I develop more of a taste for stouts. The alcohol, dark chocolate and coffee notes contribute to an overwhelming bitterness for me. I rated it higher than I probably wanted to, but I know it's a good stout. Still not the best I have had, but good.";1;1;;1
790;Pours a light orange-brown with frothy white head that leaves behind a little lacing. This brew has a great aroma of all encompassing hop scent with some pine coming through as well. Highly drinkable beer for a higher than average ABV and the taste balances the alcohol very well. Pine flavors, oily hop character, and a touch of mint aftertaste shine during the drink. Light bodied and refreshing, this a great ale for any season. Definitely worth trying over and over again.;1;1;;1

It begins with some brown sugar, before some earthy notes of nuts and caramel malt move in. It finishes with a touch of clove. A somewhat sticky palate with a sweet brown sugar taste is left behind.

792;"Purchased from Target on University, Huntsville, AL.		A nearly perfect appearance for a pilsener, with a completely transparent orange-yellow body with a thick white head. Thick streams of carbonation continually rise to the top from the bottom of the pilsener glass.		Aroma's always difficult for me to judge on a pilsener. Should I rate it a 1, for smelling really skunky and nasty, with a touch of that grassy aroma that makes pilseners so distinctive? Or should I rate it fairly highly, for being well-done to-style, and for having the courage of its convictions. I'll split the difference.		Very dry, grassy flavor with some sweetness far below. I don't much care for pilseners, but this is pretty note-perfect for the style, again, so I'll give it a good rating.		Medium-bodied mouthfeel, coating the mouth nicely and leaving a sweet aftertaste on the palate. Good.		I don't find these very drinkable, for I would never want more than one.

Floral hops and citrus aromas dominate with a touch of malt, but none of it too strong.	Taste has a stronger malt flavor than the smell. The hops are too weak. Small floral hops taste at the end.	Mouthfeel is one of the best parts. Nice medium body with a good malty chew to it.	A drinkable pale ale because it is predominantly malt flavored. The lack of hops makes this too weak to be a good pale ale to me. Not really worth trying.";1;0;;0
796;"Sampled on-tap at Longstaff's house. 		This rauchbier poured a hazy, amber color with creamy, tall, fluffy, off-white foam that clung to the glass a bit. the smell was a very nice smoke aroma with good, moderate maltiness. The taste was mildly smokey (smoked meat) with sweet-ish malt beneath the smoke and mild hoppiness throughout. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and moderate carbonation. The smoke and malt lingered pleasantly on the palate. This was a very nice beer, not overly smoked (somewhat less smokey than other Schlenkerla rauchbiers, and more reminiscent of Spezial's rauchbier). It was just as good from a growler a day or two later. The memory of this beer makes me long for Lent.";1;1;;1
797;"Acquired this beauty thanks to BEERchitect. I've been dreaming of cracking this open for weeks. I've woken up in a cold sweat a few times dreaming of dancing Founders bottles with KBS letters flying out at me and into my mouth, and rivers of dark tasty liquid showering me in droves of awesomeness. And now its finally time to sample this thing. I feel like that virgin 17year old at prom that finally steps into the hotel room with his date, made of beer.		A: AS it pours it leaves a dark stain on the air. As it rims around the glass it also leaves a dark brown syrup on the sides, it so thick I can't even call it a stain. I can only match the thickness of this to 40W oil after it came out of a 200k mile car and was there almost all 200k miles. I can almost see chunks of grains floating out with it, but I think that's my brain on KBS. A very faint almost detectable head starts to appear, but it's just a tease as it fades from memory and leaves a few small cliques of bubbles 		N: Despite being able to smell the roasted malts and chocolate from the stains on the air, I decided to go in deeper. I think I need someone to cover me. The nose is so overwhelming I think my insides just stained a dark coffee brown color. Tons of coffee and roasted malts just come billowing out of the glass on a horse of dark bakers chocolate. It does remind me a lot of regular breakfast stout at this point, but then comes the awesomeness of the bourbon and oak. The remnants of the bourbon and alcohol dance their way into my nostrils burning the edges slightly as my nose both cringes and begs for more like a sadomasochistic kid getting his first taste of the whip. Did I mention there was some coffee and chocolate there?		T: Oooohhhh snap! Here comes the train. The molasses thick oil like liquid slowly spreads out over my tongue. Lots of sweetness and chocolate come spreading out. The coffee instantly wakes my ass up, hence breakfast. The alcohol taste and burn really just lashes out at my mouth with hot pokers almost as if my mouth has just died and gone to hell. The bourbon taste starts to come through once the heavy set chocolate and coffee attempt to die out. And by attempt to die out I mean when your mouth starts to become used to it because this stuff never goes away. More dark sweetness that could only have come from the depths of Candyland hell start to berate my taste buds for attempting a second sip. It leaves a thick coating all around the mouth as if it was secretly made of wax that sticks when warm. It also seems to leave a slightly milky residue bringing me back to 5th grade and dousing my milk with so much chocolate I used to just take the Hersheys plastic container and fill IT with milk rather than the other way around. Some quick oats dash their way into the taste enough to make a horse blush. A touch of oak and vanilla round it off, if you can say that.		M: Really? Have you not figured out by now? Super thick and sticky, a viscosity of some huge number. The alcohol burns the edges of the mouth and any flesh that dares stand in it's way. Could use a slight bit of more carbonation, but that is most likely a product of the aging.		F: Finishes semi sweet, like just chewing on a piece of rubber coffee cake and then biting on some baker's chocolate. The thickness fills all the pours and taste buds so much so that I don't think I'll be able to taste my dinner tomorrow. The coffee's caffeine can't be absorbed anymore as everything is coated with that huge thick substance, more solid than liquid. The slight oak and vanilla, followed by bourbon and more alcohol seem to fade last on the tongue, except the chocolate and coffee which never disappear. With it being so ridiculously thick and strong tasting I can barely continue to sip it.		Final thoughts: While I'm sitting here enjoying this amazing beverage that I have been having wet dream about, I think my house is on fire, my son is probably in the corner chewing on wires or something, and the Patriots are somehow getting their butts kicked by Buffalo, but none of that matters as my world fades into a vertigo feeling as I blissfully attempt to consume and digest this crazy stuff. It's almost as if I'm living vicariously through myself trying to enjoy this, or am I still dreaming. Perhaps its a coma I slipped into when I took my first sip of it. I don't even think there is a word in the English language to describe it, so I'll make one up. This beer, is it still really a beer at this point, anyways this beer is transcendingerompteous. Need I say more? Can't wait till this stuff comes around again.		Edit: The Patriots came back to win with :50 left in the game, 2 hours later, just as I was finishing up the KBS!";0;1;;0
798;Seems like this would be the bud light or miller lite of Spain, but this lacks an overall flavor. A decent golden color of course with a minimal head. No real nose to speak of, smelled bland and tasted bland. Mouthfeel wasn't bad as carbonation was there, but unimpressed with overall drinkability due to a lack of taste.;0;0;;1
799;"Here we go... Thanks to Jan for this brew obtained in a bet. I insisted he send it to me since I am masochistic & he said it was heroically bad.		A: The brew pours with a thin head. Dark amber. Nothing notable here from a regular bock.	S: Smells like maple syrup. I like maple syrup but not in beer.	T: Yuck! I almost spit it out upon sipping it. Tastes like watered down maple syrup. I can't detect much bock in here at all except a little bit of fruit/toffee. I taste some sourness towards the end of each sip which is nasty.	M: Very thin. 	Overall: This is god awful. I told Jan I would finish the bottle (which I will!) but this is going to a painful experience.		AVOID!";0;0;;1
800;On tap at the Standard Tap in the Northern Liberties neighborhood of Philadelphia, this was a bartender recommend and it did not disappoint. Nice copper color with average carbonation and balanced hops. Very good taste and hoppy enough that you take notice without overpowering you or drying out the taste. While the aroma and appearance were not unusual or distinct, the taste was there and the drinkability was there. A terrific beer for a nice Friday afternoon. I think I prefer Yard's pale ale, however, this is another example of good, local beer.;1;0;;0

M: Very nice pretty near full body on her.		D: This only gets better as it warms in your glass. I drank my first one quick, but I let the second sit around a bit and just sipped on her. The flavor really gets going when you let it warm a bit. Great BREW!";1;0;;0
802;"Had one of these with dinner, and I must say, I was somewhat disappointed. Most of the brews I've had from Founders have been excellent, but this one was just above average in my book. Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass. Is a hazy orange color. Kind of looks like a peach iced tea. No head at all on the pour. Leaves no lacing in the glass. The smell is somewhat nice, but not anything spectacular. Lots of pine and citrus, but nothing all that over whelming. A good smelling beer, but nothing that makes it overly memorable.		Taste is good, a little bit of an alcohol burn upfront. That's somewhat surprising for being under 10% and an IPA. Usually, you get smacked with hops on the first sip, but the Hops come through on the finish with the one. That citrus, piney taste is there, but there is a weird bitterness that just doesn't seem to belong. It's almost like an added, fake bitterness. Just feels OK in the mouth. Little carbonation, and the lack of complexity leads to a lot of alcohol taste that you wouldn't expect from a high class IPA.		This one is definitely not a sipper. Get one, try it, drink it down, and move onto something better. If you have access to founders, you have access to stuff better than Double Trouble.";0;0;;1
803;"Clear glass 22 ounce bottle. Black and silver label depicts palm trees in a hurricane. No freshness date. Nothing about this says to me ""delicious beer"", but the side of the label assures me that it's ""brewed with natural ingredients"". I twist the cap and pour it into my trusty pint glass to inspect further.		Appearance: A hard pour produced a dark yellow beer that has little to no carbonation. Surprisingly though it has a big fluffy head, and decent head retention and lacing. 		Smell: The smell is mostly alcohol. To make an odd comparison, the smell actually reminds me of a real boozy strong Belgian ale. Imagine if Maudite was brewed with corn and you have an idea of what it might smell like.		Taste: Imagine dropping a shot or two of everclear into a Busch Beer. Adjuncts and alcohol. Nothing repulsive in my opinion, but theres nothing good to talk about either.";0;0;;1
804;"This Hoppin' Frog pours a very nice grog. Color is dark copper with a head that boasts a yellowish tint. Head is creamy in appearance and pours with an initial two finger width. As it recedes it leaves excellent lacing. Overall retention is at about 1/2 a finger's width. A bit of a thicker head would really give this brew a great appearance.		Big herbal/grassy, citrus and spicy aroma right up front. Very potent. Cascade hops are in the foreground of this brew's aroma profile. Smells just as an American IPA should. Can't really detect any malt character in the aroma, its burried under the hop aroma weak and somewhat detectable, as it should be.		An assult of hops on the palate right from the begining. It finishes with a bit of a grassy taste along with notes of citrus and spiciness. Bitterness is the first thing I was able to detect about the flavor, its there right up front. A bit of the spicy and citrus flavors up front along with some malt character but they are mostly covered up with by the bitterness and grassy flavors.		In the mouth this feels good, nothing to write home about though. Just like any other IPA. Medium bodied with relatively normal carbonation levels this beer is what one can expect from an American IPA. Finishes dry. As I said nothing spectacular, nothing jumps out at me, nothing revolutionary about it. This beer is easy to drink, could drink it all night, but for $5.99 a bomber I could get a six of Stone IPA for a better deal for somewhere around $9.00. If the price were a bit lower I could see myself buying multiple bottles for one sitting, though I can get more for less with stone so why would I?";1;1;;1
805;"Bought this because my daughter liked the label. Here we go...		A: opaque, reddish brown. (Want to say chocolate brown, but that might be the label talking to me.) Weak head, little retention or lacing.		S: like a chocolate-covered cherry, which in itself is nice, but it scares me to think about how it tastes. The really unpleasant part of the smell is the alcohol fumes that mix in with the candy smell. 		T: not good. Actually tastes okay up front, dry with a bit of hop bitterness. But then the flavoring kicks in. I can't figure out what this beer needs to make the cherry notes work, but it's not there. Leaves sort of a waxy aftertaste, too. 		M: the alcohol fumes I notice in the nose figure in an unpleasant, medicinal way here. For all the sweetness, my mouth feels the way it does after I use mouthwash.		I just don't have a lot of nice things to say about this beer. I'm trying to think of it in the context of the style, but regardless of whether or not the concept's flawed, the execution definitely is. Glad this is a single bottle from a mix-a-six.";0;0;;1
806;"Having been relatively disappointed with HF brews, I was reluctant to pay $15.99 for a bomber of this. But, curiosity got the best of me. So I'll give it a try. 22 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.		A-Pours thick, viscous and black as night with a somewhat thin dark brown head that has fair retention and leaves spotty lace.		S-A nice slightly charred malt greets me followed by some bakers chocolate, black licorice, dark fruit and a faint leather like aroma that is surprisingly fitting in here. Nose is nice and prominent.		T-Bakers chocolate and bitter coffee hit first then the charred malt comes through along with a surprising hoppy bite in the middle. The finish is bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, a bit of booze and coffee.		M-Full bodied, oily and coating. Carb level is very well suited for this beer-just enough to tickle the palate. I wish my Zhukov had this kind of carbonation.		D-For a big beer, its quite inviting and easy to drink.		Most of the HF brews I have tried don't even come close to justifying their cost. At $15.99 a bomber, this one doesn't either but it is a quality beer. I just would never pay that much for this beer again. It was nice to try, but there are too many other RIS that are just as good or better for less $$$$. If you like this style and have the extra $$$ to spend, give this one a shot. But if your budgets a bit tight, opt for something else that is cheaper and just as good or better.";1;1;;1
807;"First review...and it's a good beer to start with I reckon. Poured from a tap into a clear growler at the liquor store I work at, then poured into my 20oz Culinary Institute of America glass.		Appearance: Probably one of the darkest beers I've ever seen. It came out nice though, decent 2 finger head with lacing throughout the glass during consumption.		Smell: Coffee, Roasted Malts, etc. It was drank Christmas night so I'm having trouble remembering.		Taste: Like a Milk Stout, with notes of Coffee, don't think I got too much Chocolate.		Mouthfeel: Smooth, light, easy drinking, not heavy like I expected.		Drinkability: Very Easy Drinking, I plan on getting a 4-pack of it this weekend. 		I highly recommend this beer if you have it near your house.	Cheers!";1;1;;1

S: Lots of fruit up front with cherries, some light berries, and a moderate citrus character all appearing. Caramel and toffee follow with faint notes of chocolate, roasted coffee, and leather hanging in the background.		T: As with the nose, big fruits up frunt with the berries almost disappearing but some pears join the cherries and citrus. Sweet toffee on the mid-palate gives way to chocolate and hints of vanilla, before the fruit returns for the finish and joins with the vanilla for a long, sweet fruit finish.		M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, it's a bit thin for an old ale but not terribly so.		D: Incredibly drinkable for an old ale, not the most complex or subtle I've had, but very enjoyable.";1;0;;0
810;"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass yielded a decent head which disapated to nothing faster than Usain Bolt runs 100M. Smell is not pleasing, a bit like bad apple cider.

Flavor is some sweet dark fruit, caramel, molasses, a little chocolate, malty, but somewhat watery and light bodied, thin. 		Low carbonation, mediocre mouthfeel. 		Eventually goes completely flat, the first half of the glass was much more enjoyable than the second which I ended up pouring down the drain. Second one of these and both the same way.

819;"ah, the hype... the difficulty finding it... the limits on buying it... regardless i was looking forward to this one. founder's really does good things with bourbon barrels.		the hilarious olde-time label certainly makes for a nice bottle (and a twisty top, always forget that). poured into a tulip aggressively yielding a deep brown, one-ish finger head that dissipated after a few minutes. the obsidian liquid lets no light through. a small ring of foam remains around the edges, not much lacing but littles suds do stick to the glass.		wow. after just opening the bottle and taking a sniff, i knew this was indeed something good. chocolate... coffee... vanilla... roasty malts... and just the hint of booziness. i like.		ok, this what mattered the most and always does. i was throughly impressed. the mixture of flavors is really really well done! up front is the rich chocolatey goodness... followed roasty malt, coffee bitterness... and then shifts to a slightly sweet vanilla - bourbon flavor. goddamn dessert in a bottle.		a thick and rich mouthfeel, full bodied and no mistaking it. the slight prickles of carbonation help keep it from becoming an oil slick.		11.2%? oh, i can feel it. but the presentation combined with the aromas and flavors makes this one drinkable. must remember to sip. i want more.		a really superb beer.";1;1;;1

The trouble begins when you drink it - 100 per cent lemon soda start and not much beer in the body. Malts and hops too weak, overall feeling is watery and disappointing.

822;Had this on tap at the Founders brewery. Poured into a pint glass with a light white head. Color appeared a dark orange color. Flowery aroma with a little bit of grapefruit and honey. In the taste the hop flavors come in very clearly with grapefruit and lemon being the majority with the right amount of malty sweetness to balance things out. I love the balance of this ipa. I also tasted a mild soapiness to the beer. A clean smooth finish to the beer. A very good IPA.;1;1;;1
823;"Not what I was expecting, and that may be part of the reason for the lower scores. I don't claim to be an expert on Belgians - just getting my feet wet as it were, but I am enjoying the exploration. This claims to be a Belgian Style beer. OK. Does not specifically mean Triple, Dubbel, Strong Dark, Strong Pale, but I was expecting something along those lines.		Pour is a light sort of root beer brown with a very small tight dark beige head. OK. I'm thinking Dubbel or Strong Dark now. Smell is not memorable. Some spice and alcohol, but very faint. Taste is a total let down. No spice, no sweet. This is bitter, and not in a hoppy way, more in a dissappointing-I-don't-want-to-finish-this way.		There is absolutely nothing about this beer that reminds me in any way of any Belgian Style beer I have had previous to this. Taken on its own merits, outside of a style description, you have a bitter uninteresting, thin, highly carbonated mess of a beer. This is my second beer from BBC. I'm fairly in love with their IPA/DIPA, Professor Gesser's Mind Numbing Ale. I'm having the opposite reaction to this mess.";0;0;;1

M - It was crisp and sharp. A medium to heavy-bodied beer.		D - I rate the drinkablility low because it tasted too much like food and not like a beer. Seriously, six hours later I burped and tasted smoked bacon. Not pleasant.";0;0;;1
825;"Poured from a bottle-conditioned 12-oz. bottle. The pour was a deep orange, with a nice thick white head forming at the end. My pour may have been a bit too much, as I was left with large yeast particles floating all throughout the beer. I hope this doesn't influence things too much.		I might be losing my mind, but I swear I smell a strong chocolate aroma that matches the ripened fruit smells. This is smelling far sweeter than I anticipated. Alcohol also stings the nostrils. This could be an adventure.		In my mind, the mouthfeel is this beer's strongest attribute. It feels slick and smooth, and has a considerable heft. It has little carbonation.		The taste is a bit of a mixed bag. I am going to reserve final judgment until I have had a chance to taste this on tap as well, but I was underwhelmed by it out of the bottle. For a DIPA, there is very little hop presence. The malts and alcohol burn play the biggest role on the trip through my mouth and belly. The sweetness also seems to be coming from ultra-ripened fruits like banana and grapefruit, and of all things, chocolate. That's not to say this beer is without merit. It is certainly more balanced than other DIPA's...whether or not this is a good thing, that is for the taster to decide.		Overall, I found this beer to be a bit messy. I didn't really find the contradicting sweet, bitter, and spice to be working together that well. Despite that, it does carry some interesting flavors, so I would be willing to try it again; just don't expect something along the lines of the other American DIPA's. Also, this is thoroughly a sipper due to the sweetness and HIGH ABV at 10%. Get a single if you can before dropping $10+ on a six pack. Interesting effort by Stoudt's, but it didn't quite do it for me this go-around.";0;0;;1
826;Had this on tap at the brewery in the tap room. Pours an orange/yellow color with a tall white head that sticks around. Has a citrus aroma with a grainy character that a hefe should have.

827;"Ok, one of those beers that I take home to Dad because he usually goes for the most abv. for the price. Not surprising that he liked it. More surprisingly, I thought it was fine.		The beer opens with a standard yellow-straw color with ample carbonation, lacking head retention after the initial efforvescent fizziness. Stark white and failing, the beer shows no lacing. A basic average look.		Aromas were fearfully light-striken at first, but then mellowed into a Saaz-earthy, pungent, floral scent. Those aromas quickly turned to a familiar part-pilsner, part-grainy scent that hurt the aroma		Flavors fares about as well. This time, the grain-malt flavor goes too grainy but with an empty sweetness that was a bit too distracting at time. The hop flavors were present but didn't do nearly enough to balance the beer as the nose indicated.		The texture hurts about as much. Quite grainy, mild astringent, and low-lying bitterness kept the beer from becomming memorable by any means. The heat of 8.2% made its presence known with a mildly numbing heat and prickle. Again, empty in the textures.		Overall, the beer was about as error-free as can be expected from a malt liquor. But the beer has a lot of voids where the characterful flavors should be. Not a particularly recommended beer, but servicable in a pinch... a seriously bad pinch.";0;0;;1
828;"Name means ""ancestor"", 500 ml bottle from Riga.		Pours clear golden with rather dense head that soon dissipates and leaves some occasional downsliding lacing.

The flavor starts out sweet with toasty notes with some fruitiness - something in there reminds me of strawberry jam. This is all followed by a big, spicy hop punch with all kinds of hoppy/grapefruit flavors, which leads to a nice smooth bitterness that lingers for a good while and is welcome to do so.

833;"Pours a deep garnet color, topped by a moderate tan head that gradually fades to a thin ring of foam. Sweet malt aroma with little else. Flavor is powerful, with a sharp, dry flavor presumably from the rye. Also a good bit of black malt flavors are present as well. Dark chocolate and red wine flavors creep in a bit later. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth and creamy up front, but still has an edgy feel to it on the finish. It's fairly unique in that it starts oily and finishes rather dry. Drinkability is good. I could have a couple, but I think this is a beer that could be one to ""suit your mood"" rather than be an everyday session beer.";1;1;;1
834;"Thanks to THECPJ for bringing this back from NY for me.		A: Pours a clear orange/copper color with a one finger white foamy head, on the thick side with nice retention. 		S: Rather grainy with a bit of caramel and bready malt. Light hop aroma, mostly in the form of some citrus, but rather faint. 		T: Not very hoppy at all. There is a faint burst in the midpalate. It has a lot of grain and caramel malt, and a bit of doughiness. Oxidized flavor on the backend as well. 		M: Light to medium bodied with low carbonation. Has a metallic taste. 		O: Not very good. Looked pretty good, but the aroma and the flavor profile were a bit lacking.";0;1;;0
835;10oz pour on-tap at The Pit served a crisp light orange with a thin eggshell head that lasts as a thin layer. Aroma is a decent amount of crisp malts. The taste is an interesting blend of crisp sweet malts with a nice hop profile backing it up that leaves an interesting bitter finish. The beer is medium bodied with slight alcohol presence, but still provides the refreshment expected in a Maibock. This one was certainly enjoyable.;1;1;;1
836;"A: Appearance is dark amber color with light, beige head. 		S: Aroma is of malty sweetness, toffee, dark fruits, and a slight boozy-ness. 		T: Taste is complex - it started off with a heavy character of toasted malts, sweet bread, and caramel. As the it warmed up, there was more and more strong dark fruit flavors especially plum, which combined with the alcohol gave it a somewhat boozy quality. 		M: As my palate grew more accustomed to the heavy malt bill, I noticed more of the subtle hop bitterness that was lying underneath. Palate was full-bodied, thick in texture sitting heavy in the mouth, light and soft carbonation, and a bitter finish.";0;1;;0
837;"12oz bottles poured into Founder's pint glasses. My dad who loves his coors remembered this beer from last year and wanted one, who am I to say no?		Bright gold with minimal new copper making it's way into the mix. A nicely formed cap blossoms after only a few ounces leave the bottle, eventually forming a nicely figured one inch off white creamy head, it dies though, only to a small cap that leaves slightly window covering lace. Beautiful beer here.		For a pale ale, this beer has a nice juicy citrus bursting scent that is grapefruit up front. It's hard to get around the grapefruit, it's right there the whole time. A big floral quality comes up as well. Some pale malt comes out with bisquits. The hops shine for a wet hopped beer.		Speaking of Im not a wet hop kind of guy, it just doesen't tickle my fancy like others but I respect it. This beer is an exception, at least in the bottle. I had this on tap and the bottle is far superior IMO. With the tap version I got a big floral taste from the hops where I find the bottles to be more grapefruit citrus forward. Along with the grapefruit blast just enough malt balances this out making this well rounded. Some small mango with papaya and some bread towards the end. 		This just feels right. I don't have a bad thing to say about the feel. Im loving the new non twist off caps founder's, keeping it fresh. Medium bodied with a sharp but short bite of carb that comes and goes in between the citrus. This is a souped up pale ale and im in for the ride.		I could and would drink a four pack of this a day, it's my favorite wet hopped beer and one of my favorite pale's, but that's just nitpicking, Founder's Harvest is Damn good beer, go get some. Cant wait till next year's release.";1;0;;0
838;"12oz. bottle with a weird funky label. The label had a picture of a red old man with disheveled hair and with big thick glasses giving the drinker this dead stare. To me he looks like a mad scientist that does human experiments and is looking at his next prey. There is no freshness date but there is a notch on the main label and if you know how to read it, that will tell you a date, I guess? For this beer I had to break out my old American pint glass.		Appearance: When poured into my Beck's American pint glass, the beer was a really nice crimson red with a head of tan colored foam that was smaller than 1 inch. It was disappointing to see that it dissipated away fast leaving just a few rings and no sticky tan lace around the glass. At least the color of the beer was nice.		Smell: One of the best aspects of this beer! When I twisted the cap off, this nice spicy hops aroma comes pouring out. After I poured it, the aroma were these spicy piney hops mixed in with citrus fruits, with the grapefruit being the most predominate in the citrus fruits. If that wasn't enough, there was another wave of aromas after that. That consisted of some malt and with just hint of juicy fruits behind that. Excellent aroma!!!!		Taste: I thought that since that this beer was brewed with generous amounts of malted rye, that this beer would just taste like malted rye all over. That's not true with this beer. I noticed up front there was plenty of bitter piney hops and citrus fruits. After that was the trace of sweet malts and the spiciness of rye at the very end. Basically I found this taste to be very bitter with plenty of spiciness at the end. 		Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel sure does bite, with those bitter piney hops and the spiciness of the rye. That aftertaste sure does linger on after a while.		Drinkability: Much better than what I expected from this beer! If I ever want to be kicked again with spicy hops and rye, I'll make sure to pick up this! Another great treat from Founders!";1;1;;1
839;"On draft at Gastropub 775 in Reno, NV on July 26 2011.		This beer was, for me, extreme.		I have had rauchbier on many occasions and have enjoyed beers of the style. I get it. However, I thought this beer was awful and wondered if something had gone wrong.		The beer had an orange brown hue.		It smelled like burning rubber.		The first few sips revealed woodchips soaked in medicine. Later, medicinal flavors of beef jerky and ham developed.		I did not finish the beer. :(";0;0;;1
840;"Appearance - mahogany brown with a thin, partial cover of light mocha. No lace.		Aroma - starts with a touch of roasted grain, sets up with a somewhat odd odor of sour maple syrup or something.		Taste - brief toasty grain, followed all too soon by a sour kind of hoppiness. Gives the beer an earthy bend, which I guess is okay for a brown ale, but I was hoping for a mild, lightly toasty one to sit by the fire with. I don't care for the acidic/tart bit much, although the funk is not totally offputting. More roast character with warming, which I like.		Mouthfeel - smooth, good crispness, well done.		Drinkability - although I warmed up to it at length, not a repeat buy. I like my session beers to be good to go rather than require a can or two to get me used to it. This tastes like a beer that has just started to turn. FT - 5 cans of Obscura...";0;0;;1

842;"Part of a trade with Hoppymeal. Cloudy, burnt orange appearance in my Chimay goblet. I poured a little fast which mixed in some yeast, not that I mind it. It's 9.8 abv in a small 12 0z bottle. 		Not much of anything in the nose but what a buttery, semi-sweet flavor with a slight alcohol burn in the finish. It takes a while but a butterscotch nose appears as it warms. I like this. Slight butterscotch and vanilla and while the hops are muted, they add a tangy bitterness still. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel. 		This could be a session beer if you've got nowhere to go and yer UConn Huskies or Red Sox are one the plasma. A real smooth finish yet well balanced and flavorful.

844;A friend of mine here in Greensboro thinks this beer is the one all be all and shared a bottle with me Sunday night.Poured into a standard pint glass a deep clear amber/bronze with a half finger slight off white head atop,great clarity and hue to the beer.Whoo man the aromas are borderline harsh,just wicked resin with a bit of caramel base but the hop onslaught is wicked in not such a good way.The 168 IBU's is just overkill on the palate,its dry as all get out and bitter to the hilt,wicked pine resin and alcohol make you wanna grab a glass of water and chug it.Iam a full on hophead but this is overkill to the umteenth degree,sorry Brian I told ya I liked it but man that stuff is harsh.;0;0;;1
845;"The beer is clear, golden with a hint of brown, a small white head that leaves little lacing.		The smell is rather weak, a faint aroma of sweet bread, no presence of sour notes, very little hops.

The carbonation is low, the best feature is some dry finish.		To little smell and to few aromas, nothing really exciting.		Note: this beer came in a plastic bottle.";0;0;;1
846;"The lighter side of Tijuana. Its label is in its orginal format; in Spanish, with the importer sticker slapped on the opposide side of the main label.

On to the beer:		Pale glowing yellow in color with a touch of haze, a small stream of bubbles rising, and decent formation of creamy head that's half an inch thick and sticks a few dribbles here and there. . The smell is almost just like Guera, its beefier stablemate, but less intense. Little amounts of grass and floral hit the nose. Quite clean. 		This is more floral forward than anything. The carbonation seems to build additional bitterness to the package. Grasssy and DMS notes are very light. One thing is for sure, it's lighter than Guera.

847;"Served in a mug at Sunset Bar and Grill. Jet black with a one and a half finger tan head.		Coffee grinds and dark chocolate on the nose.

A dark beer with some memorable characteristics.";1;1;;1
848;Pours a pure bronze with a couple fingers of white head. SMACK! Full piney hops, citrus rind and grapefruit in the nose. SMACK! Taste is huge. Juicy hops, big grapefruit, rind, orange and perhaps a hint of spice. Malt is not even a backbone. If you want balance, take that weak stuff somewhere else. This is meant to be a big bad DIPA. Some pineapple shows up as it warms. Feels medium in the mouth with a puckering bitter finish that lingers on the tongue well after the sip. No A.B.V. shows up anywhere.

853;This beer pours like any other beer and looks like any other beer but unfortunately thats where it ends.

854;"fresh 2009 bottle served into a tulip		Pours a deep brown that looks viscous and black coming out of the bottle. The shade of the head strikes me as mocha, but that might just be subliminal coffee thoughts talking. An easy-going pour yields a one and a half finger head that leaves nice notches of lace.		A predominance of coffee hits the nose first and foremost. Chocolate malt and generic grain scents peek through. As the beer warms, you can make out the oat presence. This is a beer that really opens up as it warms. What was initially a generic coffee bouquet that was lacking in complexity has turned into a rich, nutty smell that marks some quality brewing. Decent grade espresso smells shine through at the peak temperature.		Taste follows the nose. Let this beer warm up a bit. Once you do, you'll realize that this has to be one of (if not THE) best coffee stouts in the world. The roasted flavors and the light, fruity acidity make for a remarkable fully realized coffee flavor package. The chocolate isn't to be ignored, either, tempering the acidity with a certain degree of nuttiness. Some earthy hops on the back end provide welcome bitterness. This is all so well-crafted. I wouldn't call this a balanced beer, as the coffee is the focal point, but all of the flavors work together so well.		The mouthfeel is right on the money. A touch thinner than I expected, but the relative lightness works well with the flavor profile. I have no choice but to score the drinkability high. This is a stout that, if the flavor profile appeals to you, will have you thinking about seconds, thirds, and a trip to the liquor store to pick up a case. At only 8% ABV yet fully-loaded with flavor, this is a dream.		I'm glad that this is readily available where I live now. This is a seasonal beer to look forward to and to be cherished. Superbly executed.";1;1;;1
855;"OK... I had to try it based on the fact that it was tempered over burning witches and I love burning witches.	Nice two fingers of fluffy white head in the glass on top of a darker honey colored beer - very clear. Nice lace follows the beer all the way to the bottom of the glass.	Smells very sweet and malty.	Tastes surprisingly bitter compared to the aroma, the sweetness is definitely there though.	Mouthfeel is medium, maybe leaning towards the thinner side.	Overall drinkability was very good I think. I thought it was pretty smooth and the bitter-sweet aftertaste kept me reaching for the pint glass.";1;1;;1
856;"Original Rating Date:	June 16, 2008		Had this at a beer tasting event. Hoppy aroma covered in skunk. Nice golden appearance. Flavor wasn't nearly as skunky as the aroma was. It was quite hoppy, well balanced. Nice to taste a true pilsener rather than the weak American light beer type pilsener. Still, I'm not a huge fan of this type of beer. Too light, still too watery, and a skunky profile thanks to the green bottle. The flavor is the best part, which is what matters, but overall the beer isn't anything special in my eyes.		Another example of a beer that I need to experience on tap to purge my memories of more light-stricken beer.";0;0;;1

860;"2011 vintage. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a vicious black, no light getting though this one. Very thin mocha head and little lacing. This stuff is like motor-oil, no joke. Definitely one of the thickest beer I've come across. The aromas are heavy on the bourbon.. but then the strong milk chocolate will hit you w/ some vanilla. The bourbon is heavy in the flavor as well, almost diminishing all of the other flavors going on. This is a pretty complex brew. There's also nice oak/woodiness to this one, which is very noticeable in every sip. The coffee and tobacco is definitely present as well. Extremely boozy, almost too boozy, not letting the other flavors shine or develop. I can argue the flavors are unbalanced, but they work in the end. The mouthfeel is phenomenal, extremely thick and chewy. Practically no carbonation. Finishes warm, actually hot. Drinkability is okay.. this is a quintessential sipper, one's enough to please. KBS loses points from me for lacking balance in the flavor department.		KBS is a great beer. I'm not going to say it's over-hyped because it's an excellent beer. There's no denying its' complexity.

866;I've tried a number of Beers from Trafalgar breweries and have been consistently disappointed so I do not have high hopes for this one. I'm trying it because there was a limited selection at the LCBO at the World Exchange Centre and i do like ESBs. The first sign that things do not bode well is that it pours extremely flat. no head to speak of. It has a sour grape scent with some caramel and something mildly spicy. No carbonation to speak of.

868;With the alternative being the Egyptian version of Stella, I would choose Sakara Gold every time. Out of the bottle, it at least pretends to be a beer. When in Egypt, if you don't want to pay expensive hotel or restaurant prices geared towards tourists, you can actually have alcohol delivered right to you (I stayed in a house so it came by scooter right to the door). The best available is Heineken, but if you are on a budget, Sakara Gold is not a bad alternative. It pours a dark, cloudy yellow with a fizzy head which dissapates quickly. It is slightly fruity - lemony - with some hops in the back. Not that good, but hey, you're in Egypt so its not so bad either. Sakara Gold is your average lager, Egyptian style.;0;0;;1

Lots of honey and some white chocoate cookie sweetness. A touch of grassiness comes but is drowned out. Taste is also overly sweet and syruppy. Tastes almost like I'm drinking honey. This needs more of a dry malt base. The honey and candi corn like taste is a bit overbearing. Hops, yeast, any other malts are lost in translation.

881;I quickly found that there were few beer choices in Egypt. Sakara sounded very local so I tried it first. It was pretty much what I expected it would be: From a green bottle it poured a light gold in color with a short-lived head. It had a grainy taste and aroma (not as bad as I anticipated). There was some sweetness along with a slight hop bite, and less carbonation than expected. All this led to an unimpressive dry, grainy finish. I never wanted more than one and I quickly found a decent local wine.;0;0;;1

889;"I could have swore I reviewed this brew before because I vividly remember the experience being below average. Here we go again, 12oz brown bottle with a bottled on date of October 2010. This brew pours a very dark brown that once held to the light displays some clarity around the edges. An initial formation of khaki head forms with more than a finger strength and slowly fades to a film that maintains across the top seemingly throughout the entire duration.		The smell of this brew initially has a pleasant character of faint, sweet milky chocolate, vanilla, oak and a bit of roast. More smells reveal some hints espresso-like coffee character that starts to turn like char. When swirled, a bit of sulfur comes out that mixes with quite a bit of mineral component. And there it is, the initial pleasing and expected character of this brew abruptly turns to quite a mineral filled scent that is slightly earthy with mixed notes of stinky cheese.		The taste is char with a bitter roasted grain element that gives way to a light amount of bitter chocolate that lasts into the aftertaste when only a small sip is taken. When larger gulps are taken, there is a tartness present that is a bit distracting and gives a chalky quality that is a bit out of place. Sulfur and mineral flavors run throughout the middle of the profile. Surprisingly this off-character gives way towards the end and leaves an aftertaste of cocoa powder on the tongue. A very strange experience for sure.		This is a medium to light bodied brew with an abundance of carbonation that is effervescent and bubbly on the tongue. I dont want to be the one that screams infection over this brew but this is a drastically different experience from the last bottle I had. The previous bottle I consumed had an abundance of dark cherry tartness and minerals that was not enjoyable at all. While this bottle was slightly better, it still tasted a bit off to me. This brew flirts with having potential but something has gone wrong. I wouldn't mind having this again when it is fresh but I would be hesitant.";0;0;;1
890;"Appearance: clear orange in color. A one finger head lingers around a while. 		Smell: orange citrus and floral hops are mild but pleasant.

Mouthfeel: crisp from start to finish. Slightly dry at the end. Brief citrus and floral bitter aftertaste. Medium bodied beer.		Drinkability: a good session pale ale. One of the better beers you can find in Nashville downtown area.";1;1;;1
891;"Poured from a bottle into my trusty Troegs pint glass.		Pours a dark, translucent brown with yellowy edges. Pretty hard to see through. There's a FAT 2+ inch head as it collects in the glass, I had to wait a few moments for it to recede to pour more. The lacing is sticky and fluffy at the same time. Quite the looker, this beer. 		The smell... oh God the smell. This needs its own paragraph, because I have no idea where to begin with this. It is absolutely like no other beer I've smelled before. I'm getting aromas of smoked pork and sausages over an open wood fire. This smell definitely belongs in a delicatessen or a butcher shop or something, not a beer! Absolutely crazy. I can detect just a hint of that weizen malt given a few deep sniffs, but it's very well hidden behind all that smokiness.		I thought I was prepared for the taste, but just... damn. Smoky meats with just a bit of a charred flavor... how does something like this get into a beer? As I'm marveling at this remarkable feat of brewmastery, the subtle malty backbone appears, reminding me that I'm drinking a weizen-style beer. Wheat and yeastiness are subdued, but definitely present as they round out the back end. I get just a subtle hint of weizen banana and fruit flavor as the brew rides down smooth. The minimal aftertaste doesn't have any more wheat for me, however, instead being full of smoked meat. Hops are undetectable, and there is no bitterness. Just a slight bit of astringency from the wheat. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a subtle weizen chewiness. Finishes smooth and dry.		After getting past the initial sensory overload, I found this beer to be quite the quaffable brew. I picked a weizen-esque rauchbier for my first experience into the style and I'm glad I did, because I'm able to latch onto that something I like and compare and contrast it with the extremely unique smokiness. It was certainly an eye-opening drink.";1;1;;1

894;"It seems I missed the message that Nemisis is going to be a new beer every year. After the wonderful 2009 maple bourbon barrel aged wheat wine I was dreaming of 10 year verticals with that gem of a beer. I was rather happy to see the 2010 out so I could sample that beer once again fresh and start building towards a vertical. The problem sadly is that I fount myself opening a thick, hoppy, barley wine? 		This beer is nearly black, thick, with a strong head with decent lacing (darn impressive at 12%). 		It doesn't have the strongest nose but the hops and powerful malt presence are there. 		100 IBU's but not all that hoppy by ""hoppy barely wine"" standards. Dates, raisins, dark malts, mixed with a nice bitter finish. 		As one would expect thick, somewhat syrupy, low in carbonation, with an alcohol and hop bite to finish it. 		This 12 oz bottle has nearly vanished so it's rather drinkable. The problem is really if that's the goal. I like a beer like this to take a bit longer to finish. 		I've tried to get away from commenting on price but hell...this just isn't enough to justify the price. There's no oak aging that I can tell going on here. This is just a big beer for the price of something that's expensive to make. I simply cannot recommend this in a 4 pack...if you can get a single or find it on tap by all means give it a try.";1;1;;1
895;"355ml bottle 8,3% abv.	Served lightly chilled in a tulip wine glass.	Bottled on: 17/09/2010		Appearance: Perfect pour - pitch black and opaque. Absolutely no light gets through, not even on the edges. The head is coffee brown and of good size. It displays good retention and leaves reasonable lace. 		Smell: What a nose! Top quality bitter chocolate, lightly roasted coffee, chocolate fudge, roasted malt, hint of roasted nuts and a good dose of hops (pine and orange peel notes). Chocolate is actually more dominant than coffee in the nose, which is on the whole pretty sweet; but I like sweet and prefer chocolate over coffee so its just right!		Taste: As with the smell, superb. Strong coffee, bitter chocolate, roasted malt, a touch of the sweet fudge and a wonderful lingering bitter finish from the hops. 		Mouthfeel: Full body, but it could be a tad chewier. That said, the carbonation is perfect. Low level, smooth and velvety - as I said perfect!

897;This is a jet black beer with only brown highlights at best when held up to the light. It has a good brown head.

898;"2nd out of 3 pilsners I tried this weekend; it followed the Victory Prima Pils and couldn't quite keep up, though I felt it too was a very good version of the style.		An aggressive pour into a pilsner glass yielded a 3-finger, foamy white head over a pale yellow body. Sparkly carbonation continued throughout. Only a small amount of lacing remained behind.		A slightly sweet, husky smell was noted, but florally hops were the most dominant scent.		As for taste: all in all I described the taste similarly to the body, with words like ""light"" and ""crisp"" coming to mind. The dry hoppy bitterness finishes the flavor, leaving a slightly sour taste lingering on the mouth, demanding that you take another sip.		Mouthfeel: again, light, dry and crisp, but perhaps a tad bit too carbonated for my taste.		Drinkability: this one is highly drinkable, especially for the summer or with BBQ. You won't get bored with the flavors, but it won't bog you down. Very sessionable.";1;0;;0

In the taste it seems to be maltier than I expected. There are rich caramel overtones, and cherry/woody hints. The hops are there in the way of spruce, but not dominating.

902;Not a good beer. Just finished my meal a few minutes ago and had that for a drink. Should have ordered something else. It pours alright. Pale yellow colour typical of light lagers. Reminded me of Coors. About a 1/2 finger head, that disappeared after a minute or two. Smelled, odd... Alright, I can detect something metallic, a little hops, and a decent amount of barley. But what is that odd smell? Well, I after a few sips, I pinpointed it. Old basement. The malt, hops and metal flavours are overpowered by what seems like an old basement, covered in cobwebs. Or an old warehouse. Very old, dusty, musk flavour that is unpleasant to smell and taste. Not something I'll drink again, nor recomment to anyone else. If offered for free, I doubt I'd take it.;0;0;;1

Whoa there, why does this happen so often? Why are so many pumpkin beers shoddily made? Some very mild spice in the background, but damnit is that nose disgusting.		Taste is buttered pumpkin pie and not quite as bad as the nose as there is a slight sweetness that, when combined with a tad bit of pumpkin, actually reminds me a bit of candy corn.

904;"A: Pours a clear dark ruby with a half inch beige head and awesome lacing. 		S: Aroma is incredibly juicy and fruity and has a distinct pot like smell. For all that hop smell there is actually some nice sweet malt in there. 		T: Instead of some IPAs and DIPAs that hit you with the hops then finish with malt this one has hop flavor throughout and the malt peeks in intermittently which adds to the complexity. I had this on tap somewhere else the other day and it was way more bitter so I wonder if perhaps they were kegged at significantly different times. Either way, it's still bitter just not as crazy as I thought it'd be, but that's good. The fruit in it is very citrusy but the malt sweetness mixes well and brings in almost a soft berry flavor. 		M: I would say this is pretty much perfect for a DIPA. Not too thick, not too light. Finishes nice and bitter. 		D: If I didn't know I would probably guess this beer was 10% but I'm not surprised to read that it's 12%. That being said I think thy it's fairly well hidden but obviously one could only have so much. 		O: Very nice DIPA.

A- Pours thin, with a head that fizzles and cracks like diet coke. It fades out hurriedly with no lacing. An odd characteristic for a beer of this style. 		S- The smell is totally off. It smells hollow. It smells like cardboard that has been written on with permanent marker. Bourbon is nowhere to be found. There is a little glimpse of roasted malts and a bit of sweet chocolate but it seems to smell rather stale.		T- The taste is a good example of pretty much everything that can go wrong in brewing. Oxidation, contamination, under carbonation, AND over carbonation at the same time. Diacytl is the star of the show. This stuff is BUTTERY. Its like I just grabbed a can of Pam and sprayed it directly into my nose, eyes and mouth. As I writhe on the floor I notice the flavors of cardboard and paper towles. Permanent marker brazenly cuts through the popcorn butter and stationery. Some where in this chaos there is a flash of tart berries that adds insult to injury. 		M- My tongue is left numb. I guess this is a reactionary effect as my body tried to protect itself from what it perceives as dangerous.

917;I had a couple extra dollars from a poker game so that means bottle poppin time. The color is reddish orange with a very small yet tenacious head.

As a craft beer fan, I love hops that really punch you in the face, but as a realistic beer consumer, I also know that a lot of people who drink beer DON'T like this, and as a result there are quite a few more mild mannered beers out there, which is fine. I guess what is disappointing to me about this beer is that the name ""pale ale"" sort of implies to me that at least some discernible hop presence is contained within the bottle, and I did not find that to be the case here. Much like Bud American Ale, which promised hops and taste and delivered a disappointing blandness, I feel as though this beer is not what it implies.		It pours an attractive brassy color, with a pretty nice amount of head. Aroma is biscuity and malty, and not really at all hoppy. Flavor is very mildly hoppy - these beers are relatively new and the one I tried I thought was fresh, but the flavor within reminded me of hops gone bad - like when a super hoppy beer gets old and loses both its hop punch and its balance, becoming a big malt-ball. Mouthfeel was unremarkable.		I love Costco, and I am a big fan of their store brand (Kirkland), but that respect does not extend to their beer. I cannot in good faith recommend this to anyone.";0;0;;1

921;"Let me start by saying this is a very good Imperial Pumpkin ale. I tend to enjoy pumpkin ales on this spicier side and this is one of them.		Poured a nice even caramel color with a light taupe head. Smelled of strong cloves, cinnamon and allspice. Taste of Apple Pie with Cinnamon, allspice and cloves. In fact I would say this tastes very similar to spiced Apple cider in terms of the spices they are using in here. Sure, pumpkin may be back there somewhere, but this is definitely more about the spices with a nice body and an imperial taste to it. Nice rich caramelized sugars and a heavy dosing of cinnamon blend this together to make it quite drinkable and all while having a light carbonation.		Recommended";1;1;;1
922;"12oz bottle poured into a cervoise. 2009 vintage.		A - Pours a murky, swamp brown with dark tan head. Dissipated fairly quickly and left a couple of lace rings.		S - Oak, wood, musty. Faint but present bourbon in the background. Sweet caramel malt, minor pine		T - The bourbon is in the background and muted. I did have a fresh 2010 Backwoods and the bourbon in that was waaaayyyy over the top. I opened this 2009 as a comparison and the bourbon was a lot more tame giving way to the nice oakiness, vanilla, some bittersweet chocolate and caramel.		M - Soft, medium, tacky. The 2010 was very alcohol-hot but the 2009 was nice and subdued.		O - A solid barrel aged beer. I actually liked both versions equally. I liked the strong bourbon flavour in the fresh one (only cuz I love bourbon) but it was very alcohol-hot. And I like the 2009 because it had mellowed out and allowed the oakiness and vanilla to shine through, but less bourbon flavour. Great beer!";1;1;;1
923;Everything about this beer is amazing. When its fresh it is delicious and has amazing coffee, chocolate, and bourbon all balanced against he oak.

925;My brother really likes this, so I tried this again recently. Must admit I am usually more of an ale guy. Poured rich golden color with head that dissipated quickly. Not bad, but no overwhelming characteristic that would make me seek it out. Kind of a low alcohol content. Slight hint of skunk in the aroma, why do they insist on green bottles?

930;"Picked a single 12oz for ~$6. Bottle date of 6/17/11? Ink has slightly rubbed off. Read the recent reviews and tread on this brew and had to try this one myself. Poured into an Allagash Chalice.		A- Pours a clearish copper hue that rests pretty dark and rich in the glass. A 1/2"" of darker off-white foam forms. Carbonation bubbles cling to side of glass. Head fades and leaves a neat filmy capping.		A- A big strong orange & tangelo aroma. Ripe and rich with a bit of tang. There is some odd background smell, perhaps what others have labeled ""oniony"". It is a bit vegetal like. A good level of sticky caramel with some spice in the aroma to give some depth. Never smelt an DIPA with this aroma before.		T- Sweet oranges and caramel upfront. Lots of balance, more on the malty side. The bitterness in there in the middle and end, but the sweet and spicy caramel body is center stage. Woodsy and earthy flavors in the mix. Some boozy alcohol taste. The hop zest really get lost in the malt bill. There is the continual odd off-taste that follows each sip.		M- Medium- big bodied. Full on palate. wet to dry pretty quickly. The caramel level makes it a tad chewy and lightly cloying. Bitterness lingers well, not to powerful. After taste isn't very enjoyable.		O- I have really liked the other Founders brews i've tried, but this one isn't for me. Too much malt and the odd off-flavor for me to enjoy. Worth a try, but not worth the price.

931;"On-tap at Stooges in Allentown		Maybe the keg was old, but this beer was just not right. The malt was too mellow and the hops were too harsh.

932;This was the first peach beer I have ever tried. I was not sure what to expect, but once I smelled the brew I was sure it was going to be pretty good. It poured in to the glass in a cloudy dull golden color. It had decent head, and the aroma was very nice. The first drink was very much peach, and then after a few seconds the wheat started to come out. The second drink was better and tasted more like beer. You know that this is a peach beer and struggle to taste the other qulities of the brew. I think this would be good pared with a desert, and was needing something a little different on a hot summer night. As far as fruit beers I think this one is better than a lot of others I have had, and worth a try pared with the right food.;1;0;;0
933;"Served in a Chicago Bears shaker pint glass.		Still halfheartedly working my way through my fatherland's myriad of breweries. This offering pours a clear yellow straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises corn, wheat, grass, light white grape skin, aluminum foil, and hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some sweet corn syrup, more hard waster, and tin foil (instead of aluminum). The body is a hefty-leaning light, with a moderate carbonation and a thickly watery feel (that may sound oxymoronic, but that's how it feels, man). Overall, I can really only say that I am not a fan of this beer. That's it.";0;0;;1
934;Pours pitch black with a hint of dark red brown. A good whiff of smoke comes through in the pour. Taste is of smoke and medium malt-with a little hop bitterness. Taste is of smoked ham, but it isn't heavy-it is light. Mouthfeel is light to medium and drinkability high.;1;0;;0

Very similar to the Strikeout Stout I had a week ago, but this one has some hops noticeable. This is not enjoyable. Way to gaseous. Hard to drink without burping constantly.

938;"Thanks to Murrayswine for this bottle.		Dark and murky brown...just one half of a shade lighter than black to the trained eye ;-p ... with a thin peanut butter colored head.		Aroma is strong on coffee with some bitter chocolate and faint crushed oats.		The flavor is practically a liquid form of the smell. It starts with a wallop of coffee that drags you into some dark bakers chocolate. The oats I picked up in the smell aren't really noticeable in the taste. A sweetness is present, but I can't figure out where it's coming from. I find myself enjoying this and I am not a stout or coffee kind of guy. Impressive.		Mouthfeel is thick and chewy . Dry and slightly bitter aftertaste makes me want to take another sip to moisten my mouth once again. The alcohol is hidden very well.

Taste: Like heaven. As I raised it to my lips, I was taken in. Lo and behold, this was an oaky, winey, whisky-laden beauty with a smooth hop presence throughout. 		Mouthfeel: Smooth and with a smooth, heavy-wine-like viscosity. Fairly low carbonation, which is natural given the special type of ale.		Drinkability: Well, I'd drink one any day of the week!

A: pours a viscous black, I raise the bottle away from the glass as I pour and the stream never breaks, even at a full arms length. Even at this distance I can't get a head on this beer, what results is a light layer of burnt brown froth that quickly recedes to a thin ring. This bad boy has far too much booze to get any lacing but I'd say that's to style for this one. 	S: a perfect blend of wood/bourbon and coffee with rich roasted malts on the back. Let this baby warm up for full effect. Molasses and chocolate roll out as it warms and the vanilla shows it's face for just a moment. 	T: ohh, the sweet burn of bourbon that is immediately comforted by an explosion of sweet sugary malts. Once this onslaught has passed the door opens to a thick molasses type/ dark fruit background with just the right amount of bourbon.

Head as small as it is settles in for a small puck and collar though, with virtually no lacing. But this beer doesn't even move it looks dead.		Hop character on the nose of a muted citrus grapefruit, a little grassy but this seems rather small for a double imperial. There seems to be something else here too maybe a little butter like diacetyl. Still alright.		One sip and it's pure bitterness. Where is the fruit sensation this just feels like pure astringency.

Not a lot of hop presence, but I'm anticipating the taste.		Taste - good smooth start, followed by a good hoppiness over the malt flavours. The wave of hop taste outlasts the malt and alternates with a mild sweetness on a wet finish.		Mouthfeel - this ale, in part due to the lower carbonation, is smooth.

949;"Got home after an uber-long day at work and was craving something dark. Grabbed this Okocim and put it in the only Polish glass I had, a Zywiec cylinder. I'm pretty sure you could generate about as much head on this beer as you want; I ended up with about 2 inches of fat, dirty brown foam that quickly fell to fluff the surface of the dark-brown-nearly-black brew. The beer is quite still and patient, as if it's waiting for my lips to disturb the surface. Oh, if I must...		Smells rather... fruity. My initial response was to do a double take; 'cause instead of the usual roast / chocolate, I got dark fruits and booze. Interesting. Eventually it dials down, but there's still a ton of cherry, currant, and alcohol to smell here amongst the roasted grains and milk chocolate character of Okocim. Minor earthy and coffee notes swirl around too, but they're simply support. Sweet and cool, this smells strange -- and strangely compelling.		I confess, the last time I had this I dinged it for being too sweet... and this IS sweet. Easily one of the sweetest Baltic porters I've had, but there's some good stuff going on here... a restrained roasted grain base lets gobs of sweet chocolate and what I can only describe as cherry / raisin flavor shine. Really no hops to be tasted. Big dark fruits hit the tongue; this is an easy drink if you like sweetness and it hides the 8% abv quite well. Smooth and dessert-like. I still can't drink much of this, but there is little denying that Okocim is tasty stuff.		Mouthfeel? Mid-bodied and not-quite creamy-slick carbonation. Finish is rum raisins, chocolate, prunes, cherry and a little warm smack of alcohol. Lingers long in the sides of my mouth. Nice... but very sweet.		I honestly am struggling to drink the 500ml bottle... I will... eventually... but I wouldn't reach for another. It comes up just shy of cloying after half a glass. Maybe you'll dig it more, but I'm giving it low marks here.		Okocim Porter is good. Alright, there, I said it. I prefer more roast and bitter character in beers of this style, but if you haven't had this fruity malt-bomb, you should. At around $4 a bottle there is barely any reason not to give it the ole college try.";0;0;;1
950;"My friend gave me this bottle around May, so this bottle has aged a little.		A- An opaque motor oil black with just the faintest ruby highlights towards the bottom of the glass when exposed to light. A small brown head composed of fine bubbles disappears into a slightly splotchy blanket across the surface of the glass. Slight lacing is apparent as a defining circle outlines the glass wall.		S- Burnt roasted malts that are reminiscent of roasted coffee and dark bitter chocolate. Beneath the large roasty smell are hints of nuts and a bready character. The finish of the smells melds together with the chocolate undertones, but more complex character derived from a slight bitterness from hops and a lasting alcohol noticeability.		T- The taste does not parallel the smell in strength. The roasty complexion that was expected was very subdued with hints of coffee and chocolate that miss any real complex character. There is a bready and nutty character towards the beer and it almost rivals the intensity of the roasted and chocolate malt. Towards the end the bitterness provides more complexity than the malt with a slight alcohol taste, but leaves the feeling that all the tastes are a bit watered down.		M- Medium bodied mouthfeel that lacks a chewy or silky feeling that should be accompanied with oats. Slightly watery and lacking any real carbonation. 		D- Surprised at this beer as I have heard good things about the brewery. This could be a result of an older (maybe slightly oxidized) bottle rather than a bad product. At this point not very drinkable. I'll chalk this one up to an isolated incident for now and hopefully will be able to try this one again later.";0;0;;1
951;"Poured ye old brew into a pint glass for great justice.		A - Pours a beautiful golden copper, hazy thanks to the unfiltered status of the beer.

S - Surprisingly sweet at the first sniff, with a bitter, hop kick backing it up. Sort of like a pink grapefruit on the scent. Very subtle balancing, and an attractive nose for sure, with a little twist of spruce.		T - Mmm, friendly combination. Heavy citrus tones, like the grapefruit in the nose, come alive here, as does the hop combination. Very clean tasting, so to speak, without any heavy bitterness detracting from the flavors. Sure, more bitter as it warms, but the citrus is enhanced as well. Awesome job.		M - Smooth, creamy body with a crisp finish. Super-refreshing, and would make for a great summer drink (note to self).		D - For an IPA? About as good as it gets. Founders really nailed the style with this one. Great first experience with the company!		Overall/notes: Hey, first Founders brew! Not at all disappointed by this one. I'm surprised at how smooth this IPA turned out to be.

Has more of a pilsner taste but no hops or anything else... Didn't do anything for me. 		Mouthfeel- Light Bodied, Light-Medium Carbonation, Watery, and doesn't leave anything on palate... Pour all around. 		Overall Impression- This is one of my first drain pours of the Fall... For some reason, there was such a great aroma but nothing in the taste or mouthfeel... Like water with a bit of sugar and hop added. May need to try this again to see if the Bottled date was too long ago...";1;0;;0
961;I guess smoked beer just is not the beer for me. It smelled and tasted like a spiced smoked meat, which I will eat on occassion, however, the flavor just is not what I want in a beer. I think I will be staying away from smoked beers as much as possible.;0;0;;1
962;"Poured into the Sam Adams glass.		A - Pours a beautiful strong copper color with an off-white head that is pretty dense and is about 1.5 inches tall. The head has great retention.		S - Nice piney and grapefruit smell. There is also some nut and bread hints to the nose that blends in nicely with the piney smell.		T - Nice initial sweet malt taste that quickly is seized by the grapefruit acidity and dryness. There is also an immediate piney hint right before the grapefruit comes in. The hop character is extremely appealing. 		M - Medium to light bodied with some nice crispness and great balance with CO2.		D - Very drinkable, ABV not too high.";1;1;;1
963;For a light beer this one is not the worst but that really isn't an endorsement. Certainly it is drinkable in a pinch even if it is weak. Nothing metallic here but it has a little grain husk like malt to it. Light hops, light sweet smell, and light pale color. But what do you expect its a light beer. The taste and the aroma are the same.;0;0;;1

Appearance is dark amber clear, the color of bourbon, under a smallish head that fades quickly.		Smell is sweet malty vanilla, with vinous sour cherry-blueberry wine aroma. Lots of sweet and sour fruitiness. Metallic rusty pine floral hops.		The taste is a bit of sweet malt at the front, followed quickly by a big rush of bittering hops. Bitter, metallic, unsubtle & bright. Long dry-bitter finish. A bit one-dimensional. However, that's the style, right?		Mouthfeel has a surpisingly rich fullness and thickness. Nice.		Drinkability is lower due to the one-dimensional aspect of the beer: ESB's are supposed to be more balanced than this.";1;1;;1

T/M: Dark chocolate notes with a slight sweetness that like hot chocolate syrup. Bitter coffee flavors of expresso and extra bold coffee--these are also present in the finish. Sweet caramel notes round out other two. Milkyness is present for a second before the bitterness develops. Robust with a big body. Warming in the chest with the high abv and slightly boozy, but it's really masked by the larger than life flavors of this beer.	D: Yum. Only word I can come up with right now. It's thick and bold, warming but not overly boozy. Nice balance and easy sipping. Seek it out if you can as it's worth the quest.";1;1;;1
970;"On tap at O'Shea's on Baxter in Louisville. Poured into snifter.		A - The beer arrived a dark amber, with almost no head to it. I didn't watch the pour so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. Lacing was decent at best.		S - The smell was a lot better than the looks. In my notes I described it as ""luxurious"", due to the rich profile of it. The nose was primarily malty with hints of nut. Slight funk when swirled, not much sweetness to the nose.		T - Very well balanced attack, barley opens up to a mild heart and finished with a very nice hop kick. Hops tend to build up towards the back of the tongue. I'm not quite far enough along to really pick anything out with this one but that didn't make it any less tasty.		M - Super smooth, light to medium bodied, carbonation was good. Finish was nice and clean, though increasingly hoppy. Hoppy aftertaste but not overpowering.		D - Eminently drinkable for any occasion, I foresee a session of these soon. It was gone all too soon.		As a bit of trivia, Hell For Certain is named after an area of the same name in Southeastern KY, just a bit south of ""Hell Creek"" and ""Whynot?"" You really can't make these things up.";1;1;;1
971;"Poured from a 650ml bomber into a pint glass. Thick pour. No dating info. Color was pretty much pitch black. it had an average sized dark brown head that quickly settled into a good collar. Not much lacing and none sticking but that's not surprising considering the ABV on it. Overall a good appearance for a RIS.		The aroma was booze heavy so this one must have been pretty fresh when I got it as it's sat for a bit but is still hot. Past the alcohol is some hops, dark roast malt, coffee, vanilla and chocolate. Good but would be great if the alcohol was tamed a bit. The taste follows the aroma. Starts off with some booze and then the roast malt and coffee kick-in with the vanilla starting at the end. Good taste but the alcohol drowns it out a bit. Mouthfeel is full and creamy.		Overall, a good RIS but I prefer B.O.R.I.S. (top 3 RIS for me). Maybe I'd have a different opinion with some age on it. It sucks that they don't date their bottles. I rolled the dice that it already had some age on it but it didn't. Not available here in TX - got from Ummagum in a shipment. Rotation - would like to try an known aged one. [O;O]";1;0;;0
972;Poured into my New Belgium snifter. No head to speak of, even with an aggressive pour. It's amber in color with good clarity. Spice slaps you in the face as soon as you raise the glass. Wow, pretty heavy on the cinnamon & ginger. The spices follow into the taste, overpowering any hops bitterness, and only moderately detectable maltiness. This has a medium mouthfeel, and though it's heavy on the spices, it doesn't linger. I like the spice in my winter warmers to complement the backbone of the beer, not become it. Way too heavy on the spices to give this one a high grade, because even as the beer warmed, the spices became even more pronounced. Most of the robust dark beers I normally drink get better as they warm, but not this one unfortunately.;0;0;;1
973;"Just kind of picked this one up on a whim after walking past my favorite bottle shop in State College. Looked interesting enough and figured I'd try something different.		A - Right after popping off the cap, I got a very strong scent of sweet cherries. It poured a deep orange yellowish color and built about a one-fingered head that stuck around for a bit. Body is a bit cloudy and don't see much carbonation. Not much lacing.		S - Nose is strong cherry up front, with a bit of sugary, grape smell behind. Quite fruity and a little bit spicy. Besides that, not much going on the bouquet.		T - The taste actually really caught me off guard with this one. It's quite a bit more sour than I thought, and is certainly overwhelmingly cherry and fruity. Some malt at the end, but almost no alcohol at bite. It's tasty, but a bit too sugary tasting and kind of reminds me of not-so-good wine.		M - Very light-bodied with almost noticeable carbonation. This lack of carbonation aids in the comparison to a cheap wine. 		D - Drinkability isn't very good. It's flavorful and hides the alcohol well, but the sugary and sour combination hurts it. A unique offering but I don't think I'll be seeking this one out again.";0;0;;1
974;"Much thanks to BEERchitect for this extra.		Its orange with a quickly disappearing head. Lacing is still quite good though. It smells very malty, mostly caramel, with a touch of grassy earthiness, but not too much hop character. The taste is slightly sweet and light. Again mostly a light caramel sweetness dominates. The mouth feel is slightly grainy and a bit watery. There some smoothness present to this. A great session beer that I would love to have while out in the hot sun. Could easily drink a bunch of these";1;1;;1
975;"The beer was chilled and served in a pint glass.		Appearance: The body of the beer is ruby colored. The head was pale white with very little retention. No lacing marks my glass. 		Smell: The aroma of the beer is mulled apple cider with nice spicy nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamon, ginger, brown sugar, and molasses. 		Taste: Very sweet spicy apple pie hits my palate. The spiced flavor is as I expected from the aroma. The spices give a bit of bitterness to balance the brews sweetness. No alcohol is present in the flavor. 		Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body is medium. The carbonation is low and at times seems flat. The beer isnt a drain pour but not sure I would repeat this beer again. Given the choice between this beer or Anchor Steam Christmas I am rolling with Anchor Steam.";0;0;;1
976;"Pours a slightly hazey copper color with a decent head.		Smells of toasted malts dominate the aroma along with hints of citrus fruits.		The flavor is actually really nice.

All in all a very good beer, very smooth, I could have a few of these.";1;1;;1
977;"Appearance: clear orange in color with a 1/4"" head that disappears immediately. No lacing develops.		Smell: malts and grains are soft and barely detectable by the nose.		Taste: grainy malt, corn, grass, green grapes, and a hint of bitterness make up an off balanced beer. 		Mouthfeel: smoth and lightly dry throughout. Medium bodied. Clean aftertaste.		Drinkability: a poor polish beer here. I had a tough time finishing the glass. Avoid this one.";0;0;;1
978;"BOught at Binny's for those who don't know you have to ask for it because they keep it locked up and they will only sell you one bottle.		Well, what can I say but very dissapointing, I guess after the hype I was expecting something as good as Goose Island Bourban County Stout and this just didn't deliver.		There is no Bourbon taste this at all just bitter black coffee and a little chocolate. What this needs is some nice vanilla to balance it, much too bitter.		Seek out the Goose Instead.";0;1;;0
979;All the hype I ever heard of this beer is that its the best tasting light beer, its like a real beer. I found it to be a good looking beer when poured and to have a bitter after taste that kind of had an imported feel to it. The beer is hollow and does not fulfill your taste. I would much rather drink a carbonated watery beer than one that is going for that full flavor and will never achieve same.;0;0;;1
980;The pale golden amber colored body was clear, and the head was quite thick. The aroma was a very inviting grapefruit and pineapple. The taste was bit more light than I prefer. The dry and earthy bitterness was on the money, but the lack of a solid malt backbone hurt the flavor a bit. The sweetness of more sugary and simple kind. The feel was sooth and slippery, with not a whole lot of tongue coating stickiness. The alcohol was very well hidden and the beer was very easy to drink.;0;0;;1
981;SECOND TRIAL: Bottle from Breeze-Thru. This is a very nice fruit beer. Not something I'd want to drink on a regular basis, but definitely nice. It pours a nice rich red with very little head on it. The smell is fresh raspberries, as is the taste. There's not the same sourness that occurs in a lot of raspberry lambics (which makes sense because I'm pretty sure they don't spontaneously ferment this), but there is some nice, light tartness. The finish has a lingering fruitiness that makes this beer easy to sip away at. Despite this, I probably couldn't have more than one at a time (I don't think that finishing a six pack of these would sit well with my stomach). Overall a well done fruit beer that's perfect as an every-so-often brew.;1;1;;1
982;"500ml bottle.		Pours dark brown in the glass but shows through a deep clear copper when held up to light. There is a big fluffy beige head that recedes to a thin cap quickly.		The aroma is, typically, fantastic with a massive smoked wood character. Some decent sweet malts and summer sausage. Man do I love the nose on Schlenkerla beers.		The taste also starts with smooth smoked malts, lots of bacon and campfire. Malts underneath to support the heavy smoke. Very sweet but completely smoky.		Very smooth feel with solid carbonation.		Well, I feel like a Schlenkerla fanboy, but, damn, I love these smoked beers. They are head and shoulders above everything other smoked beer out there. So good.";1;1;;1
983;"Appearance: poured into my favorite snifter.. the FBS is jet black and indisputably opaque. After a minute or so there's little to no head.		Smell: this stout has a very strong coffee aroma.. smells like a fresh cup of French roast.		Taste: lots of dark roasted coffee with some bittersweet chocolate.. alcohol and oat flavors are present in the finish.		Mouthfeel: like many well crafted oatmeal stouts, the mouthfeel is smooth and slick. Full bodied with a little more carbonation than I was expecting.		Overall: there's no doubt that you have to love coffee to really savor this one; thankfully I do. This is stout only gets better as it warms.. I can't wait to crack open my bottle of CBS!";1;1;;1
984;"330ml bottle into pilsner glass.		Pale straw hue with a thin white head that settles to a thin cap. 		Light and slightly sweet grains with only a touch of hop aroma.		The grains are light again, but come with a slight toastiness. Hop flavor is on the low end. Light bodied with high carbonation.		Probably popular in the area it's brewed in, but this one isn't impressing me. More light husky grains and not much else.";0;0;;1
985;"Again, thanks to Dave from Founders and Chuck the owner of the Dilly Deli in Cincy for hosting the Founders tasting event.	A: Nice, a little darker than amber color. No head and little lacing to speak of.	S: Nice smell of citrus and figs. Can pick up a little alcohol in the nose as well.	T: A little more of a kick than the bottle offers. The flavors are a little more pronounced in the tap offering. A stronger spiced coconut rum is noticeable. A very good offering on draft.	M: Very smooth and good. A little bit more harsh than the bottle due to the pronounced strength of the flavoring.	D: A very sessionable beer. Very smooth and tastes light.

988;"I picked up a 4 pack of this on a whim, so unfortunately, I'm stuck with 3 more. Review is from notes taken on 9/5/2010 and poured from the bottle to a snifter.		Appearance: Pour just looks thin on the way to the glass; starts dark brown/near coffee black; starts with a one finger dark brown cocoa head that fades quickly to a thin and uneven, yet complete skim; body is entirely opaque; a few swaths and spots of lacing are left holding behind. 		Smell: Rather weak - bit of a roasty burnt coffee scent and a slight cocoa sweetness; absolutely no aspects of bourbon or barrel; as it warms there is a slight tart cherry scent that begins to creep out.		Taste: More of a tart cherry fruitiness with a hint of cola-like sweetness and just the bare minimal presence of bourbon and slight cocoa. Very disappointed and I feel the FDA should look into the name of this one... If something claims to be something, then shouldn't it actually be just that?		Mouthfeel: Thin, loose and watery; carbonation is quite foamy and frothy in the mouth at first but then essentially disappears entirely; a thin dry coating is left on the roof of the mouth and the gums and cheeks are left a little tingly from that initial blast of carbonation.		Drinkability: I will certainly not be seeking this one out again and I really think that BBC should be ashamed of themselves for trying to pass this off as bourbon barrel aged.";0;0;;1
989;"12oz bottle split with oglmcdgl, been about two years since I had this one.		A- Bright golden with some light bronze spots with a thin but sustainable cap that stuck to the glass in theory.

Some earth in the distance.		T- Starts off earthy and slightly tropical but overall it's pretty much earthy with those type of hops with some grapefruit and a small malt bill. It's just not all that large, but it is rather tasty. The pale malts seem to steal the show in this after time.		MD- The feel is a step above thin with a crisp carb going for it.

All I can think of is onions & garlic. Wow this is downright hard to even get through. I'm guessing this is what happens with hops overload. I appreciate the effort, but the taste is a mess.		M - Medium, somewhat creamy body. The taste and aftertaste makes it harder to appreciate anything else.		O - Everything else is there to make it a worthwhile brew but the taste honestly is a mess. The appearance is great, the feel is ok, I can see why people like the smell. But all in all, I doubt if I will even make it through this whole thing. I tried it, glad I did.

Coffee, wood, chocolate, and sweet malts with touch of maple.		M: Heavy medium body with carbonation on the low side. Super smooth.

Outrageously foamy head, over two-fingers deep and high, with great retention and lacing. Head remains throughout, never quite dies. 		Smell: I get a bit of an ocean-y smell, takes me back to the seashore in my hometown in Northern Spain. A bit briny indeed, but mostly sweet, with agave, honey, caramel and plain old sugar. Waxy aroma at the end, like an old candle dying after burning for too long... some glue too (but not bad).		Taste: Sweet, bready, thick. This is like the liquid version of a buttered toast breakfast in the morning... plus some cereal! Very nourishing. Sugars all over, hard candy. Caramel and some hops at the bitter, dry end. A hint of coffee. 		Mouthfeel: Medium body and carbonation, full flavor. Hoppy finish. Thick, sticky, sweet. Not for everyone!		Overall: Not your average old ale, perhaps not even an old ale at all, but a fine strong beer nonetheless. Not too unbalanced despite the strong caramel-y sweetness.
