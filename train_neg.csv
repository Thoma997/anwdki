"Came in a brown half liter bottle with a good looking multi-colored label. Ingredients conform to the purity law. Expiration date was 10/8/03, I opened it on 7/26/03.		A standard pour produced a horrible thin white head with huge bubbles. Fortunately, I didn't have to look at that head for long. The liquid itself was a reasonably healthy golden hue, but oh that head! The nose was nasty - iodine, sulfur and bad fruit. The mouth was flat and sweetish. The initial taste was medicinal - acidic, sour, syrupy. I was stunned to note a fairly nice hop finish after all that nastiness. The aftertaste retained a bit of the bitterness, but far more of the sour sweetness.		I suspect that this was a bad bottle, as I don't remember the on tap version I had before becoming a BA as being this bad. Or, perhaps, I'm just more sober now..."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass, got a bottle in a holiday beer exchange		A- Very pale clear gold color with a white head that fades quickly.		S- Watered down sweet malts and corn.		T- Watery, light sweet malts and grains, a little bitter in the end, but not a good hoppy bitter, more like a skunked bitter.		M- Crisp, very light, and watery.		D- Drinkable like flavored water is drinkable. I guess if you wanted to chug watery beer this will work, but you want to drink a beer for the flavor this is not worth having."
"Appearance: Pours a rich amber-red color with a ton of hop haze; definitely not the palest India Pale Ale around. An inch of head forms from a gentle pour and then quickly recedes.		Smell: Huge pine and grapefruit with an equally large malt character to support the hops. Fruit punch and caramel come out as the beer warms. No noticeable alcohol.		Taste: Extremely bold, resiny and sweet; equally balanced between malts and hops. Mango and grapefruit, lemon rind and caramel. Incredibly intense, but fairly drinkable (albeit slowly). Alcohol is barely noticed between the massive hop bitterness and the malty sweetness. Resiny bitterness completely consumes the palate in the finish, relentlessly attacking the roof of the mouth.		Mouthfeel: Sticky, oily and thick, bordering on downright syrupy. Moderate carbonation keeps this one lively and somewhat drinkable.		A decent DIPA, but too heavy on the malt for my liking. Actually, just too heavy in general; this beer has no finesse."
"I can't imagine a worse winter warmer. Surely the worst that I've ever had. The cinnamon completely over powers the taste of every other ingredient. Ginger? Nutmeg? Where?		Pours pretty syrupy. Low carbonation, about a 1/4"" head. Looks similar to a brown, maybe 2-3 shades darker that Great Lakes Christmas Ale. Upon smelling, all you get is cinnamon. You know those Brach's cinnamon disc candies? It tastes like that. I wanted to dump it, but for the price paid, I choked it down.		After having DORIS, which was one of my favorite beers ever, I was excited to try the rest of their line-up and selected this one. Simply awful."
"12 oz bottle best by 8/9/11, poured into a pint glass		A- penny copper in color with a 1 finger head that settles quickly leaving a bit of lace suspended above the thin ring left on the surface.		S- nose has some toffee like characteristics, some muted hoppiness is present, and a little buttery toast. Not bad, but nothing stood out in this area.		T- Lots of what I believe is diacetyl. I believe on a good day this might be going for ""biscuity"" or something similar, but this isn't what I'm getting. They've achieved some balance as there's a bitterness that is balancing the pale malt, but I'm not impressed.		M- light bodied and light in carbonation.		O- This one didn't do it for me, and I'd have to say it's a below average brew, maybe I'm just missing something from the style, but I wasn't pleased with this one."
"12 oz brown bottle.		Foamy white head with not much retention. Plenty of noticeable carbonation. Virtually no lacing. Extremely watery; the faintest shade of dull straw coloration. Other than that, this beer is clear.		Corn, rice, and a metallic graininess. Skunky aroma as well.		A moderate wheat flavor joined by the usual rice and corn dynamics typical of a light lager. A very weak malt character and a touch of unflattering hops. The skunkiness returns and lasts throughout the aftertaste.		Very light bodied; fizzy and grainy on the palate.		This is just an insult to the word 'beer' in terms of both the 3.5% abv and the flavor. I'd rather be drinking water. It's a shame that marketing is all it takes for a company to get rich off of such crap."
"22 oz bottle purchased at the Charleston Beer Exchange and poured into a Paulaner Weizen glass.		A: Pours a light orange color with a lot of yellow mixed in with it. The head was not what I expect from a Weizen beer. What was there did not last long and left no lacing since the bubbles were large.		S: Banana, spice, and a bit of bubble gum yeast aromas mix in to make a classic Hefe aroma. It is inviting, but not as fruity as pleasant as others in the style.		T: The taste follows the nose. However, the spice seems a bit over the top for my enjoyment. I like fruit to be the star of the party in a Hefe. It just seems too aggressive for the style.		M: The spicing once again makes the score here suffer a bit. It is just too aggressive in the mouth. It is also a bit thin for the style and my tastes. I believe part of that is due to the lack of carbonation compared to others.		D: The spicing once again hurts it here. I just couldn't knock it back like I can so many other examples of the style."
"500 mL bottle poured into a pint glass.		I'm not sure why this is classified as an ESB, when it says ""pale ale"" right on the bottle. Seems more appropriate style to me as well. Anyway . . .		Pours with a thick, rich off-white head, very foamy. Sits atop a reddish-brown (more brown than red) brew, clear and clean.		Smells interesting. Some faint sweetness, perhaps floral. And some wild grains are picked up.		Taste is very bitter, almost spicy, most likely from the hops used. I found the taste very difficult to enjoy, although the mouthfeel is fine.		Not likely to try again anytime soon."
"Bottle poured into standard shaker pint glass because I need to save my snifters for New Year's Day football/friends tomorrow. No freshness date readily visible on the bottle, but for a big 10.2% scotch ale like this I don't anticipate age to be an issue.		A: Hazy dark brown color with a nice bubbly 1 finger white head that dissipated quickly.		It did leave a moderate amount of nice lacing on my glass as I worked through it.		S: Huge sweet smell of prunes, licorice, and other dark fruits and candied sugars is detectable even as I pour, before I even try to put my nose to the glass for a test.		When I go to my nose I can pick up a little alcohol as well.		T: Taste follows the nose, dark fruits and candied sugar with an alcohol presence. I can definitely pick up on the bourbon-barrel flavors. This is only my second bourbon-barrel aged brew, but the Goose Island Bouron County Stout that I'd had before this had similar charachteristics, so I think that's a good indication that I'm picking up on the *notes* that I should be.		The taste quickly turns from cool, light, and carbonated to full as the dark fruits and candied sugars move in quickly at the middle of the taste. The beer finishes with the distinct sweetness/pucker of bourbon and a warm booziness on the tongue.		M: This beer is well-carbonated and sticky sweet in the mouth, and finishes with a boozy-warm feeling.		D: I think I just don't much care for bourbon-barrel aged beers. This beer has a lot of interesting things going on, but it's just ""not for me"". A little boozier than I'd like, but it's really that overwhelming bourbon-sweetness that turns me off here. And at 10.2%, you probably wouldn't want to pound several of these in a given night even if you liked it."
"Bottle from ABS Drinks outside Brussels. From notes. Split with a friend.		A - Dark copper with no visible carbonation. Slightly hazy with a thin cap of beige head.		S - Citrus and grapefruit with a tingly note or pineapple.		T - Citrus and bread. Pineapple is obvious.		M - Medium carbonation with a full body and not overly bitter.		O/D - Underwhelming. Not a hop bomb at all. Not overly hoppy but not bad. Not what I expected and just not all that great."
"I am in town doing the bart and beer tour. This thing is really cool. If in town try it. no driving and lots of beer. oh yeah alright beer so far. 		10oz pour		color- Cherry Red This thing is bright red as it goes. 		Taste- fruity in flavor with a bite. 	there is some hops that makes it a little interesting. I was surprised that it so hoppy. it weighs in at 6.5% the bartender told me. he was very informed on his beers and made my Sun. pleasurable. 		All and all this beer would not make my prime-time list or even my repeat this beer list but that doesn't mean it's not good. i am just not that hoppy of a fan. Surprise for a red...."
"Twelve ounce bottle of the 2010 batch poured aggressively into a pint glass.		Even with the aggressive pour there was only about 2 fingers of slightly off-white head that formed atop the chill hazed amber liquid. Some lacing evident throughout. To be honest, it looked a little boring.		The smell reminded me a lot of Bells Oberon. Definitely a malt forward bill here and I suspect at least some wheat was used if not dominantly wheat. A little tartness and sourness is faintly detectable but I'm not sure if I would have identified it as cherries if I didn't know they were there.		Taste is very good. Big puckering sweet & sour cherries dance all over the place on this one. This is what you try this beer for. None of the cherry flavor tastes artificial either. It's just a great vehicle for that Michigan cherry flavor. I docked it half a point because the finish is long and a little gummy and not in a particularly good way.		As stated there is an unpleasant gumminess to the mouthfeel that is unpleasant in the finish. The overall feel initially is medium bodied with full malt roundness.		Drinkability might be a little below average. The flavor is great, but it's lacking in other areas. If the finish was tweaked and improved it would be more sessionable but even then, it is a nice beer to try, just not the kind I want many of. I would buy this again but it will probably be next year before I do. Recommended once every season it's offered."
Although listed here as a strong dark ale, the flavor really didn't strike me that way, although seeing that the abv is so high is surprising. Flavor profile was more Flemish brown ale - some sweet/tart up front, with brown sugar and sour cherry. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, going watery toward the finish. I will admit to being a bit creeped-out by the label artwork.
"I had this on tap at Founders brewpub. The chalkboard described it as ""massive amounts of strawberries, cherries, and pomegranates"". The beer is a very hazy pink color, looked a little like a strawberry daquiri. The smell is intensely fruity, this is a very unique beer. Lots of strawberry in the aroma, not much of a malt aroma in the background, just fruit. The taste was very tart, almost sour with fruit, not bad but just, well, massively fruity. A little pale malt in the backround, detected at the end of each sip, but mostly strong fruit. Too bitter for my tastes, not as drinkable as you might expect. Interesting brew, one and done for me. If bottled I will not try it again..."
"12 oz bottle.	6.7% abv.		Interesting to read the wide range of reviews for this beer. Quite polarizing. Love it or leave it, I guess..		Dark (yet translucent) orange. Very large head..soap suds bubbles and islands of lacing left on the glass.	I had to smell this a couple times to make sure I wasn't going crazy..this doesn't smell like I thought it would. With the edgy neon bottle graphics, the huge lettering of ""IPA"" stamped on the front, and the fact that this is a Pacific Northwest version, I thought I'd be in for some serious citrus cone hops for some reason.. Instead, herbal hops and a woody, earthy malt come out and mix for an almost medicinal creation. Different alright.. Medium bodied..oily mouthfeel. Not sure I could drink too many of these in a sitting..the flavors just don't jive together like they should..and any brew trying to pass as an IPA is going to have to show more hop character than this to be respectable in my book.	Certainly doesn't seem to fit the bold American style and misses the mark for me.		I've got another bottle to compare to this one, but I'm not thinking this was a bad bottle..I'm thinking simply just a subpar beer."
"Selection from the beer of the month club		Poured into a pint glass, a very dark ruby color with a nice white head a some lacing.		Very sweet aroma of toffee/ caramel, with roasted malt and some earthy hops.		Bitter taste with the hops over taking the malt and toffee. still some sweetness with a little alcohol.		Medium body with just enough carbonation.		Since I'm not a big pale ale fan, this beer is not my style and I wouldn't put it on my want list. However, if is a typical pale ale."
"A: Pours a nice creamy off white head.		S: Smokey with the smell of a newly opened band-aid. 		T: To me, the smoke flavoring was overpowering. Get yourself ready for a liquid smoke type experience. The band-aid smell also carried over into the taste. This is definitely not my style of beer.		M: This beer does have body to it...		O: This was a tough beer for me to drink. I could not finish a full beer as it was like drinking a burnt piece of oak. If this is your style, then I'd think you'd be happy."
"pours a decently shimmery dark honeyed hue with a creamy tan two-finger head that has impressive retention and leaves some nice lacing.		aroma is earthy bitter hops, some pale malt, and more hops. hints of pine, honey and more hops.		taste is pure bitter hops. tastes like liquid hop extract, pine needles, a touch of grapefruit pith, and some honey. as the label proclaims, this one is bitter... but at the sacrifice of substantial and vibrant hop flavor. as it warms, more honey and caramel malt comes through, as does more alcohol heat and more bitterness.		mouth is full and thick with a touch of creaminess and just enough fervent carbonation to prevent it from being cloyingly syrupy. 		If you like pure liquid bitterness, this one is pretty solid. but if you're hoping for some true hop flavors, this one is unfortunately significantly lacking."
"A - A thin yellow-gold color that was clear as many light lagers are. Head was nothing to write home about but it did leave a very very slight lacing.		S - Grainy. Not much.		T - Grainy with a slight hopiness. No malt to speak of here.		M - Crisp and carbonated but not as clean as some other light beers that I have tasted. Decent, nonetheless.		D - If you are the market for a light beer, this wouldn't be the worst choice you could make. Possibly a good thirst quencher."
"Come on Trafalgar!		I'm not the one to be a stand out from a Raised Fist lyric either		""You got nothing to say and that scares me""		When Trafalgar hit it bang on with their Rye beer I wrote the brewery personally and congratulated them. Even the Celebration Ale was great, the Hop Nouveaux excellent!		But talk about hit and miss - this brewery pumps out a lot of beer - and they keep having the same problems! Inftections, bottling...I mean come on Trafalgar - I am rooting for you - keeping quiet doesn't accomplish anything - but are they listening?		Poured a cloudy deep opaque orange light amber colour - nice, but too cloudy - this stuff looks like homebrew bottled straight from primary.		The smell was ripe with cascade hops blanketing a lack luckluster homebrew - Another brew using hops to cover up. Some sweet tones in the back, honey like.		Tasted sharp and sweet - hoppy and bitter; that was nice - cascades galore, but more blanketing as a limp liquid followed.		I like the crisp bitterness from the hops - and I liked the no prickity prick of an over carbonated brew - that was easy though, cause there must have been another fuck up at bottling causing this one to come across as a beer flavoured drink.		Drinkab...aw screw it		Look Trafalgar - this is barely reviewable stuff - and I doubt this flaming review even has your ears burning - Get it together.		I will pick up your next offering, and do wish you the best - but with your continued lack of care your making this relationship trying."
"Appearance: Clear yellow, thin, fizzy head.	Smell: None	Taste: None. Maybe some off chemical taste. 		Overall: I won't remember drinking this beer in 5 minutes. Utterly forgettable. I suspect (like others that have negatively reviewed this beer) that I got a skunked/old bottle. I need ""zero"" ratings for this beer because it didn't even rate a 1.0 in any of the categories."
"This double ale was new in Atlanta so I bought a bottle from Total Wine, poured into a pint glass:		A: Dark brown color, finger-width of head with minimal lacing		S: Roasted with malty undertones, a bit of hops is there too		T: Also savory, like soy sauce with dry finish. 		M: Medium bodied, carbonation was biting enough		D: Definitely not a taste I'd like to repeat, too roasted, not malty enough, and hops only contributed to bitterness."
"22 oz bottle into a couple of tulip glasses.		Pours a dark clear ruby in the glass, with a  finger of off-white head. This retains with some thin foaminess around the edges that leaves a cascade of spotty lacing behind. The aroma is heavy with spices, along with cherries, caramel, and sugary bread. Muddled notes of clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, are all so overpowering here; it's really hard to make heads or tails of this nose at times. 		The taste is a combo of more spices, roast, and caramel, which is giving off a bit of a molasses character. Dark fruit is coming out as well, as the flavors and alcohol combine into a sweet and tangy warmth that drenches the mouth. Those spices are just as dominant as they were in the nose and come out HEAVY in the finish. The mouthfeel is fuller bodied and surprisingly sharp in the carbonation department despite the overall chewy alcohol warmth in the body. 		I can see where they were going with the different flavors here, but unfortunately the combo of a ridiculously heavy spice profile and overall high alcohol content rendered this a pretty much undrinkable mess. A rare drain pour for me."
"Thanks to jmpizzo for sending me this one!		Pours an almost (like 99% here) opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to a thin film. Random blotches of lace stick to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oats, sour dark fruits, and an alcohol scent. Taste is of dark fruits up front with some malt/oat flavors on the finish. There is also a sour flavor that is coming through on this one that I am pretty sure is not intended. Perhaps an infection? This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, I am disappointed in this beer. I think there is an infection or age issue going on with this one. The sour smell and flavors are pretty off putting in my opinion."
"650 mL bottle purchased in July, BB 10/10. Bought for my wife, but now that she's pregnant this is a bullet I was not wanting to take. Poured into a pint glass strongly.		A: Amber, sometimes more of a reddened macro lager look to it. Little head, on the first pour I turned my back and before I had an opportunity to consider it, there was none. When poured strongly for my second glass where it gave a white head with little retention and no lacing.		S: Macro lager aromas. Corn, vegetal. Maybe hidden under all that is a hint of medicinal cherry... I would never have noted nor said that had the bottle not advertised it as such. Some sweetness in the nose too as the bottle warmed.		T: Abysmal. Macro lager (they claim this is an ALE?) . A wisp of cherry initially, became strong (faint still though) as the glass warmed. It went from a 1.0 to a 2.5 maybe, although still not enjoyable in any sense. If I wasn't cheap this had drainpour written all over it.		M: Um. It was carbonated and didn't leave any odd off flavours on the palate. I guess that's a plus.		D: As I said, almost a drainpour. Admittedly an old bottle, but I doubt it really fell off that much being refrigerated for the past 7 months instead of sitting in a warm warehouse..."
"Presentation: Tappered 0.5l brown bottle. No freshness date. On the back label: ""In 1525 the Polish king Sigmun the Old granted the exclusive beer brewing rights to Lezajsk Brewers. The law was not a royal whim. It was a token of respect for the mastery of Lezajsk Brewers. A true flavor of the legend of Lezajsk 1525.""		Appearance: Pours a pretty pale straw golen beer with big carbonation bubble and a big white foam head that quickly settles to a weak transparent lace.		Smell: Musty grain and faint herbal in the aroma. Veggie-ish.		Taste: Smooth and very light bodied with a near watery consistency. Malt sweetness is more veggie sweet, with an odd corn flavour. Grain flavours are very tannic, semi-astringent and unpleasant on the palate. Light herbal hop spice flavour that tries to save the beer, but fails leaving behind a light floral flavour tucked beneath, and eventually aiding to, the ""malt"" mess. Finish is dry, bitty, full of tannins with strong -- near overwhelming -- metallic and mineral flavours on the edges.		Notes: By far one of the worst pils lagers that I've tasted out of Europe. Adjunct City, baby. Save your money. Steer clear of this beer."
"Appearance: coppery brown, good clarity, thinnish layer of frothy light tan foam that slowly compacts to a thin cap		Aroma: malty-nutty brown bread, dates, herbal hops		Flavor: dryish malt backbone with a rye-crisp quality; grassy hop flavor with an early, raspy bitterness; finishes dry, leaving a vegetal, bitter aftertaste		Mouthfeel: medium body, fine carbonation, slightly astringent		Other comments: Not very balanced. The bitterness is a bit sharp at first. You really need to nibble some pretzels or peanuts to level things out a bit."
"The beer was served in a Imperial Pint glass. 		Appearance: The beer pours a ruby opaque dark brown coloration. The head is approximately 2 fingers high with a light tan coloration.Webs of lacing remain on my beer glass.		Smell: The beer has a small amount of smokey roasted notes from BORIS. The beer has a fuzzy hoppyness from Hoppin To Heaven. The hops bring a bit of citrus and pine resin hops.		Taste: This beer honestly doesnt work for me. The hoppyness from the IPA come across like citrus and pine rolled in an ash tray. The BORIS flavors are weakly represented. 		Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is the result of mixing two very solid beers. I really like BORIS and Hopping to Heaven is no slouch either. The individual beers are much better than this mixture. The beer seems to be thin on the mouthfeel. The smells and flavors of this mixture dont do any justice the beers components. The beer is barely ok to drink. Stick to the beers individually. Nice try but back to the drawing board."
"A- An opaque black with a small dark brown head that becomes patchy with a ring around the glass. 		S- Dark roasted malt accompanied by dark chocolate and hints of coffee. Slight bitterness chocolate notes pick up towards the middle of the beer and accompanies the smell towards the end as the roasted smell finishes out the beer.		T- The taste starts out much like the nose, a smooth chocolate complexion brings your taste buds to attention as the roasted malt and coffee taste develop towards the middle of the beer. A hot alcohol taste pushes aside much of the chocolate and roasted malt as a bitterness is the only other taste that continues into the aftertaste. Has a lot of potential, but this one still seems hot and should sit for a while. I'll probably pick another one up and put it away for awhile. 		M- A great think and chewy mouthfeel, very smooth and refreshing and is definitely the highlight of the beer.		D- The hot alcohol taste makes this one a little difficult to put down. Something I hope would improve with some time as well."
"Bomber	Appearance- Looks more orange than amber		Smell- It's hard to smell this beer with all the foam. If you enjoy huge foamy beer head then this is your beer. It seemed a tad out of control to me.		Taste- This beer may have been tainted or a bad batch. It wasn't skunky but it was hard to detect any floral or carmel notes of any kind. Just a bad beer taste. I would never recomend this beer to someone who wants to start drinking beer, if they did they would would swear off beer forever. 		Mouthfeel- Too much carbonation felt like soda pop		Overall- I really wanted to enjoy this beer because it is a local brew, but wow sad to say it was a bad beer."
"Tasted alongside the urbock. Pours a deep brown with a finger of quickly dying head and wisps of lacing.		The aroma is pure campfire smoke. Waking up at 7 am after a night of drinking by the fire hair smell. Some coffee grinds in there as well.		The flavor is a bit lighter on the smokiness. Somewhat watery actually underneath the initial layer of smoke. Not as deep as the urbock and truthfully not really noteworthy. No ""off"" flavors at all which is a positive, but not really many ""on"" flavors either.		The body is medium and a bit watery. Carbonation is high but not stinging.		Overall this is a decent enough beer, but not one that I would really feel the desire to drink again."
"A - Bright nearly flourescent yellow, carbonation bubbles raging, gigantic white foam head. Odd gray sediment making its way to the bottom of the otherwise innocent glass.		S - Right fresh malty smell. Reminiscent of the smell at a macro brewery.		T - Sour, sulfur, metallic, fresh green peas and grassy. That's just from the first swallow. Second taste yields a ton of metallic taste with added sulfur fun.		M - Greasy with not too much aftertaste. Thankfully.		O - The name says it all. One of the few drain pours I've had in quite a while."
Was about to type in my review of this beer before the shred of paper with my scribblings completely disintegrated in my pocket, but the first line of the previous review caught my eye. Maybe I should just say ditto and be done with it. I was about to write about how Ive tried this beer several times and from different bars, restaurants and six-pack stores and in different towns (in case the problem was the distributor), but its always quite skunked. It pours a clear, medium gold with a touch of amber and has a very small, white head that quickly diminishes to a very thin film. But the smell. Yikes! I was hit by the strong skunk as soon as I popped the cap on this bottle. I poured it and let it sat, knowing that sometimes the skunk will subside just enough that you can concentrate on the other qualities of the beer, but this one didnt. All I got was skunk with a little bit of floral hops and light grain sticking out behind it. The taste was more of the same. It has a medium-light body, dry texture, and low carbonation. Drinkability? Im rather stingy with my money and didnt want to waste a beer that cost as much as it did, but I couldnt do it, and half of it went down the sink. The burps of skunk for the next half hour made wish I hadnt even had the 6 ounces I did. Some of the other bottles of this beer I've had have been slightly better, but never good. Total disappointment, and I doubt Ill be giving this another chance, not at that price. But I agree with Hero27 that maybe I would give it another chance if it were on tap somewhere.
"Review from notes 06/03/10	Poured from bottle to perfect pint.		Did my best to find this beer hidden in a dark place with a far out expiration date given it is bottled in green glass (ultimate culprit in skunking). 		The beer pours a golden straw color. No head, low ribbons, excellent clarity. Alas, my attempts at finding a fresh bottle has eluded me, nose is skunk-tastic. I struggle with the allowence of skunk on a beer, given how well known the issue is, and it's a CHOICE to refuse to package in a format which would preserve the beer's freshest flavors. Makes you wonder if they think the American palate just prefers skunk. Either way, this beer comes across as very, very mediocre. 		Not a fan. Although, I imagine the beer might be better on tap given the packaging."
"Group tasting notes from 2-18-11	Poured out of a bottle. 	Served in oversize wine glass.		A- DT pours a light gold color. Not too much head or lacing at all.		S- One taster said it best: ""it smells like citrus-scented pine solve"". That's it, you get a little citrus, then an entire forest of pine. It's aggressive, it attacks the nose.		M- The mouthfeel is smooth, but it definitely coats the mouth, dries the mouth out.		T- Tastes like pine solve. There was a little citrus taste at the beginning, but middle and end tastes are all pine. Not balanced at all, or maybe balanced perfectly for pine lovers.		Food: We paired the DIPAs with spicy pork tacos and spicy chicken wings. This actually overpowered the pork and made it taste bad. The spicy and sweetness of the wings actually brought out the citrus a bit more.		Overall: This didn't win over our non-ipa testers, everyone finished their glass but didn't want to kill our test bottle."
"Appearance: clear despite the deep dark amber colour. The head is beige to light brown, moderately large and creamy. It seldom persists and presents little lacing.	Aroma: caramel and some roasted sweet malts.	Taste: not so strong roasted presence, sweet malts, molasses and fainty bitter taste. 	Mouthfeel: moderate level of carbonation, moderate alcoholic strength and light body. Watery.	Finish: burnt bitterness aftertaste. Not very long.		Overall: I did not appreciate this one. Too watery and characterless to deserve a higher grade."
"Ok, I am making a HUGE change from my prior review based on the fresh 2011 bottling. Do not know if my palate changed or the beer, but I find it strange that I would find something so much more bitter two years later considering all the IPAs I have had. BTW, the original review was July 2009, not November 2009 as listed, so it was also fresh:		Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Pint.		Appearance: Burnt reddish-copper with thin head and slight lacing.		Smell: Sweet fruity malts, onion, pineapple, pine, grapefruit and citrus hops, some alcohol noticeable in the background. Odd and dank, but distinctive.		Taste: Hop onslaught - definite grapefruit and citrus. Some pineapple and onion. Complex sweet malts, with caramel, toast and fruit. Extremely bitter at the finish - to the point of distraction. Somewhat boozy tasting, which does not mesh well with the bitterness and flat out odd hop taste.		Feel: Thick and chewy, smooth, low carbonation. Too boozy, but otherwise the mouthfeel is not an issue.		Original overall comment: Excellent slow sipper (I took an hour). Overall, great balance of hops and malt but the relatively low bitterness makes this seem more like a hop-forward Barleywine than an Imperial IPA.		New overall comment: Comes across as an extremely harsh Barleywine. Interesting flavors, but very hard to drink, even as a sipper."
"Appearance - opaque black, not even a little color on the edge. A thin layer of mocha bubbles on top. Some spotty lacing, rather random.		Aroma - very dark roasted malt, with definite scents of chocolate, espresso, and charred oak.		Taste - an intense play of the oak barrel with the chocolate. At times the char almost tastes peppery like chipotle. Not much else gets through besides the alcohol on the swallow. The burnt, charred flavor is more intense at first and mellows with temperature. It's basically a chocolate and bourbon experience, but it is so over the top that it's a bit of a chore to enjoy. Some intensities of flavor I like, but this bourbon influence tends to take over the profile making it hard to pick out and enjoy any other flavors.		Mouthfeel - not as heavy as I expected but still silky smooth. Good amount of carbonation and still lays down a serious layer on the palate.		Drinkability - this is a very intense beer, and while I like some of the bourbon barrel styles, this one is a little too wound up for me."
"Sampled this at an epic tasting hosted by EinWeizenbitte. Thanks a ton Todd!		Appearance: Dark brown-black body with lighter brown around the edges. Creamy khaki head sits on top and retains pretty well. Great lacing for a barrel-aged beer!		Smell: Smoke, rum, some whiskey and vanilla characteristics. Having trouble getting much else out of it, especially with the barbecue going outside. Still, it seems like the nose should be much more pungent on this one; it's pretty weak for barrel-aged beer.		Taste: Smoke, charred wood, and whiskey, but pretty mild on the whole. Some vanilla and estery alcohol. Barrel-aged eh? For a couple weeks maybe? Tastes like it was run through a barrel on it's way to being bottled. Weak.		Mouthfeel: Dry and medicine-like. Oily I guess, and kinda thin. Low carbonation. Just not good.		Drinkability: This was the weakest barrel-aged beer I've ever had. The barrel-aged flavors that do come through even taste a bit artificial. Not feelin' it."
Bright crystal gold pour with a sustained creamy but thin bright white head. Aroma is loaded with solvent, plastic, chemical, fusel alcohol, raw honey, sweet malt. Lots of sweet/tart, boozed soaked granny apple skin. Flavor follows suit. Very little hop presence, lots of sticky, chewy honeyed malt. Loads of barrel/brandy presence, but does little to add to/enhance the flavor of the base beer. Sticky body with a surprisingly dry finish. Blech. Tap, Haute Dish.
"I tried this one after a long trip round the supermarket with the wife, so I expected anything wet at that point would have probably pleased my pallet. This was on the whole a very disapointing beer.		The beer was a pale amber and very clear throughout, but produced very little head when poured into a glass. There were only faint hints of aromas from the beer, slight hint of hops and a wheat and tiny hint of fruit, but I had to really try to find these.		The taste was similar to the flavour, not horrible simply non existant. There was no overwhelming taste to speak of and it actually felt like drinking a lager, very watery. I dare say that if I enjoyed the taste it would have been a very drinkable beer given the light feel of it. This would probebly be a beer that any lager drinker would enjoy, however I prefer a bit more flavour and body to my pint."
"A: Golden with no head at all.		S: Toasted malts with a very sweet fruitiness. There are hints of booze throughout.		T: Pretty clean considering the style. It's a husky type faint taste with a boozy hint throughout and some slight bittering in the finish. Way too much about the booze and not enough about the taste.		M: Smooth with little carbonation.		O: Not terrible, not good either."
"Paid $3.49 for a 12oz bottle from Discount Liquor in Milwaukee, WI. I pour into a snifter to review.		A thick brownish orange elixir pours from the bottle. No head or carbonation. 		Bourbon-like boozy nose with candied raisin, oak and caramel malt. Has an organic earthiness to it and even some slight butterscotch hints.		Taste is more reminiscent of a boozy barleywine than an old ale. A bit hot from the alcohol which is poorly hidden. Fermented dark fruits, bourbon, oak some caramel malt.		Almost no carbonation detected in the mouth. Medium-full body with an almost chewy texture and long finish.		Even taken as a boozy sipper, it really is not all that great. If I wanted to sip on booze, I'd go for some fine bourbon on the rocks, not a boozy old ale."
"Sampled on-tap at the brewpub on 6/3/06..	According to their blackboard right above the bar: 3.5% ABV, 50 IBU's...what the hell is with the weak abv??		From their beer menu: ""Flying Aces Pale Ale - Four large hop additions to the boil of this brew give this one its characteristic hop finish; every hop head's dream!"" 	I mean, how could I not try it with a write-up like that..		Hazy amber color. Head looks like soap suds..bright white, huge bubbles. I thought I had ordered a beer, not dishwater...disgusting.	I can pick up some hops in the aroma, but the metallic copper smell (like the kind you get when you handle a bunch of pennies) pretty much overshadows the hops here. Taste follows suit, with a metallic element that makes this very hard to drink. Old/bad batch possibly? Let's hope so for the sake of this brewpub's future...		Overall, I'm hoping that this was the last bit in a very old keg, and that the glass had dishwashing liquid in the bottom before it was poured..otherwise, this is a pretty sad excuse for a beer. Maybe I'll give this one another shot next time I stop in...then again, maybe not."
"Reviewed from notes from Early December 2008.		A - Very Dark Brown to almost black. Thin with little head present.		S - Alcohol is very present. Bourbon. Clean and crisp. Quality in the smell. 		T - Strong Alcohol Burn for a 10%. I have had better in which the alcohol was greater but its taste was hidden. I was expecting more from the smell. Also, I wish it was thicker. Hard to get in Minnesota so I am greatful for trying. Some Coffee and chocolate taste but overpowered from the booze taste.		M - Thin but very smooth.		D - Not really. Not found in Minnesota. Also, because of the high alcohol content, a sipper at best. Just not my favorite."
"Doesn't look red by any stretch of the imagination to me. More like a murky golden color. Champ of a head though, left lots of lacing and it's still around after almost an hour.		Smells like dirt and honey. Rather gross really from start to finish.		The taste is still dirty, but in a toasted cheap malt kind of way, rather than actual soil. Also has a fruity tone, a bit of light flower and a sweet taste on the back end.		The mouthfeel is thin-bodied, but thanks to the long-lasting head also smooth and creamy too.		Too dirty smelling and tasting to have more than one or two (ever) unless it was all that I had."
Iam not sure if I got a bad bottle but Iam gonna review it now and get another in the future,this was not very good at all.Poured a dull burnt orange with no head to speak of at all,just looked flat.Heavy spice in the nose with cinnamon,and clove being most prominant over mace and cardamom.Overly spiced flavors with cinnamon and cardamom being way overdone.I had high expectations for this beer,Iam not sure if its off, or really this bad.Just sweet boozy and overspiced.
"I loved Nemesis 2009 and have been looking forward to this since it's oops early relase last month. Picked up a 4 pack today. 		A - Deep deep brown on the edges but near black all around. A vigorous pour into a DFH Signature glass leaves a sticky beige head		S - Sugar, malt, alcohol then fruity hops in that order. The malt lingers in your nose which is remeniscent of an english barley wine.		T - Alcohol on is huge here but it mixes well with the piney hops on your toungue. There must be a huge malt backbone here but it really gets lost in the mix due to the sugar and piney hops.		M - Rich and creamy which is intruiging as it's so high in ABV. I do think this will get better with age because the body is there.		D - A slow drinker for sure. Huge sugar, malt and alcohol here.		I'm a bit disappointed in this latest offering. I visited Founders while in MI and had some tremendous barrel aged beers. I sure hope Nemesis 2011 mimicks some of those beers! This just falls short for me in the American B-wine category."
"A - A nice, sap-colored, golden amber or copper. Big three-finger head that almost completely disappeared after about 2 minutes. Not much carbonation.		S - Not much to the smell. Mild orange-sweet citrus, if anything.		T - Much like the smell. Maybe a little wheat as well.		M - Good mouthfeel. Medium-bodied even without much carbonation. This is my favorite part of the beer.		D - Not bad. This one was given to me, and I would definitely drink another free one. Not enough to make me go out and buy one, though."
"A: Nice color, couple fingers of nice fluffy white head. Decent lacing considering the level of hop oils. Cloudy with lots of floaters, especially the second half of the bomber.		S: Pine sap and spicy pepperiness smack you in the face. It smells like a a big pile of hops. There are also some alcohol esters and actually a decent aroma of biscuit-like malt.		T: Hops dominate. Bitter, pine, lime zest, pepper. Just tons of hops. If you don't like hops, avoid this beer.		M&D: This beer attacks the palate, very bitter. Medium body. The bitter aftertaste lingers for a while. This beer is definitely one and done.		While not a bad beer, there are definitely better DIPAs out there. I am glad I tried it but will not be seeking it out again. It is just too extreme, too bitter, to be anything more than a novelty beer."
The aroma is sweet and malty with a floral hop and a hint of lighter fluid (strange for a 5.2%). The appearance is pale gold with a thin head. The flavor is like the aroma but thankfully very weak. The palate is watery. I am quite sure I don't want to taste it again.
"a: deep brown color with ruby red highlights, little head at all	s: roasted malts and alcohol	t: started off well with mix of roasted malts and alcohol, but didn't finish	m: medium body to start but finishes almost watered-down, little carbonation 	d: this brew seemed to be half-done with a good start that turned watery and unfinished"
"Appearance: dark amber, good clarity, not much head development		Aroma: lush malty backbone w/ just a hint of dark malts and roast, very light woodsy hops, strawberry fruitiness, angel's foodcake, hazelnuts		Flavor: subdued malt sweetness, predominating flavors are dark malts and a pronounced hop bitterness, hop flavor is definitely ""English"", wood, finishes dryish with resiny hops and a hint of corn (weird!) in the aftertaste		Mouthfeel: medium body, mild carbonation, a bit astringent or ""dry"" feeling		Overall Impression: Pretty good all around. Full-flavored, but the hop bitterness is a bit too harsh for my taste. Not too bitter, just a bit harsh on the pallate."
"heineken light. it pours to a light golden color with a limited head. smells bitter like a heineken. 		the taste is lacking, but it is bitter with some malts to it. it really does not have too little flavor for a light beer, but you know how it goes. the carbonation is also not overpowering which i find pleasing. you can drink it easy."
"So he goes for another mixed sixer of the best of the worst from the grocery store this weekend. I grabbed six more ""gems"" and did my best to get them all down. served cold and poured into a pint glass, this one was consumed on 08/22/2010.		and here we go with the winners of the night. i have ha this one more times then i can count and it just never gets any better. the classic light golden almost water colored pour with a small fizzy head and lots of carbonation.		aroma is light grains, muted hay, just a watery almost none existent taste and smell, really just not at all what you are looking for in a good beer. clean and crisp, it really is just about like water from beginning to end.		overall not the worst tasting, just the least tasting i had this evening."
75cl bottle. Pours a hazy golden amber with a medium white head. Lots of sediment as this was the bottom half of the bottle. Smells overwhelmingly like honey. Quite sweet with lemony, herbal notes and a bit of tang. Tastes somewhat citric with a good deal of malty sweetness. A bit of mineral/dish soapy character (it's not the glass). Light mouthfeel with medium carbonation. A bit too sweet/phenolic to be enjoyable.
"Pride of Milford Special Ale		Bottle into Pint Glass		Appearance: Dark amber with very little head, even when forced.		Smell: Caramel malt with molasses hints.		Taste: Caramel again with slight hop bitterness.		Mouthfeel: Okay mouthfeel, very little carbonation and a week body.		Drinkability: Maybe it was old or just not to my liking, but it's a no-go for this one."
"I picked this one up at the ABC store on Baymeadows in Jacksonville. The label is kinda cool with the Monty Python motif, ""tempered over burning witches.""		I poured mine into a standard pint glass, and a white, big bubbled head rose up about two inches. The beer itself was a clear, plain amber color. The nose was lightly hopped and pretty lacking of much character at any level. The beer itself is very lightly hopped initially but thin and lackluster in both body and flavor. No real malt backbone there and really kind of simple, overly so in my opinion. I know my pallette is used to American, overhopped styles of ale, but I remember being more impressed with Bass the last time I drank it.		Notes: I found this one appears to be all about the marketing and label, and could use more substance behind it."
"Poured from a 50cl bottle	A - Clear golden yellow with a fluffy white head that quickly dissipates. no lacing.	S - Very bready, a little alcohol and a little caramel.	T - Quite sweet from away. Taste follows nose.	M/F -Medium body. Beer is a little sticky. Carbonation is a bit light.	D - It's OK but a little too sweet for my liking. Will not seek out."
"A - Poured kind of flat, didn't see a whole lot of action going on, has the hue of a cranberry-apple juice color.		S - A bit of a cinnamon? malt. Some sort of spice. Otherwise very malty.		T - Typical winter ale. Malty / hoppy. Neither is too overwhelming.		M - Has a surprising carbonation. Otherwise not a whole lot else going on. Doesn't have much of a lingering taste on the tongue, more on the back of the pallate.	 	O - Not a fan. I think this is my first Stoudt and unfortunately not too impressed. I still have hope for the Tripel, Double and Kolsch. 		**NOTE** I'm drinking this late April... and I'm not entirely sure when these came into my work as they were there before me... wondering if age has ruined this beer for me."
"Basically black as it sits in the glass (especially in low light) but magenta-brown highlights can be teased out with some concentration. The head is squat and sandy, and doesn't last very long.	The nose is a bizarre blend of Dr Pepper, prune juice, cherry skins, band aids, manure, and black tea. Roasted note peek out as it warms, and just add to the chaos. 	It's equally arcane inside the mouth. A quick notion of chocolate covered peanuts is quickly shattered by a dousing of sour cherry juice, heading into balsamic vinegar territory. Yeast moves in and strews barnyard notes (complete with cow pies), and gauze bandages, and iron-rich blood. Small amounts of clove and vanilla pop up as it warms. Cola emerges from the tail end, and rides long into the finish, with a resurgence of black cherry. Hops are virtually shut out, but a bit of grassiness dots the swallow...but may well be a continuation of its farmy qualities. Alcohol doesn't really show up either.	Thick and flatish in the feel, though some struggling carbonation persists throughout. More than one 12oz bottle seems like a dare for someone else.	Weird shit, this. It's like a Sour Brown mixed with Mr Pibb. It's dangerously close to ""hot mess"" status, but I really don't hate it, and actually find it a bit intriguing. Wouldn't recommend it, though.		As a note, I've had the bottled version as well, and it's more of the same, with a couple notable differences: less barnyard funkiness, a touch less cherry sourness, and more cola sweetness. The numbers would stay roughly the same... as though it matters any."
"Batch2. Thanks to my bud Alex (Rhinos00) for hooking me up! This sample however was a casualty in shipping. The cap was loose and 1/3 leaked out so I cracked it the same night I received it.		Poured into my duckrabbit snifter. Beer looks very black and dead flat. The cap could have leaked all the carbonation. A few bubbles are on the rim, but it was wishful thinking that they equaled carbonation.		Smell is bourbon, but not overpowering, lots of vanilla, chocolate, clove and almost a cinnamon note. Fantastic!		Beer is flat thanks to the leak. Some prickles are felt when I swirl the beer in my mouth. Finish is roasty, chocolately, and dark fruits are mingled in. I like the sweetness from the bourbon and vanilla. The stout is not dry, so the palette stays refreshed, but the flatness gets to you.		Points come off for mouthfeel (flat) and drinkability (flat). Its a good thing I have more."
"A/ this bottle poured a scant head that disappeared after a second, otherwise had a dark, chocolate-like body		S/ the smell was its best characteristic with a sweet, roasted malt earthiness 		T/ disappointing due to being overly carbonated and having a sweetness that lingered too long		M/ flat		D/ discarded the majority of this bomber down the drain		Given some of the positive reviews, I wonder if this bomber was severely out of date. As it was, I would not purchase it again."
This beer has character. It leaves a lace but it smells better than it tastes. While I appreciate that it has more complex flavours than many beers it leaves a sickly sweet aftertaste. I prefer a more bitter hopped experience however and lean towards flavourful pale ales.I could easily skip this one next time around.
Lobster Lover's Beer? Ya, well, maybe. However, I love lobster an this isn't the first beer I'd think of to accompany by a long shot. Poured wth a small, white head that mostly faded fast and no lace. Color is a very clear medium yellow. Aroma is malt, hop, leather, bark, earth, and funk. Flavor's similar. Body's a bit chalky and ok carbonation. Finish is short and unremarkable. Session beer if your choices are very limited.
"Pours a slightly hazy, dark golden orange color with a two finger frothy off-white head. Decent retention only slowly fading into a lasting ring. Streaks of soapy lacing left behind. 		Slightly spicy aroma with sweet malt notes and faint hops. Brown sugar and cinnamon with caramel, toffee and biscuit. Kind of weak really. All of these elements are subtle. 		Medium bodied with a prominent autumnal spice character up front that lingers over the sweeter notes into a dry finish. Slight crisp hop presence compliments the spices but doesn't overpower. Not bitter. Sweet malt backbone is kind of watered down with caramel toffee and nut. Mediocre."
"If you like head....well this is for you. Huge almost root beer float like top on this one. Murky orange body with a lot of lively bubbles. 		Spicy hops with a hint of citrus opens it. Followed by and mingled with a LOT of bready elements that adds a lot of grain elements. This is followed by a lot of sweet malt notes. I'm expecting a very english pale ale flavor.		This is a well balanced beer, a good bit of hop bitterness at the end but the beer is well balanced as it goes through. Bready grains mixed with a lot of floral citrus notes. These notes never pass the sweetness of the malt beyond a touch of hops at the end. The finish has a good bit of soapy flavors that I'm not digging.		Given the AMAZING head, the carbonation in the glass seems marginal at best. 		This isn't my style of beer. The english elements are iffy to say the best. It isn't a great beer and I won't go back I have to say."
"Looks almost clear with a slight yellow tint and no head at all.		Smells like a skunk, even with the brown bottle. At least it had some sort of aroma.		Taste is awful. Watered down hops with a strangely stinging mouthfeel. This was not good at all.		At 3.5%, if low alcohol is your aim get a bitter. I will never ever touch this again. Guess the comercials are right by saying the ""Lite beer drinkers lite beer."" I guess I'm not a lite beer drinker."
"Thanks to sweemzander for busting this one out of the cellar for us to share.		Poured into my tulip the beer is pitch black with a modest mocha hued head. Tiny bits of soapy lace fight to stay on top of the beer.		The aroma is full on whiskey. It's hard to pick out the other smells with the whiskey so pronounced. After some warming i can pick out hints of chocolate and coffee. I'm not sure if it's the barrel but I'm getting a solid dose of play-doh. This totally throws me off.		The flavor is pretty much all whiskey all the time. Hints of sweet dark chocolate and roast coffee are present but they keep getting pushed aside by the damn whiskey.		Full viscous body with very light if any carbonation.		Overall this bottle has at least a year on it and yet it was hot as hell. Too much whiskey for my taste. I will have to let my bottle sit for another year or so."
500 ml.glass bottle- color of amber , with a small white head - nose of malt , oats , corn , and slight hopps  taste of sweet malts , yellow corn , and iodine - body high carbonation , and sweet acidic - aftertaste of sweet , caramelized , and sour
"Got this as a Christmas Present. Poured into a pint glass.		A: this is far and away the lightest Double Bock I have ever seen. I was convinced upon the pour that the beer was in the wrong bottle. Pale gold/straw color with good clarity. Thin head with minimal lacing. This scores really low since it is not to style.		S: the nose quickly confirms that this beer is in fact a double bock. Deep sweet malts up front with grainy, corn like notes in the middle.		T: sweet malts up front, candied dark fruits, bready grains, notes of caramel. Many flavors I associate with a double bock, but also an adjunct lager-like character that throws things off a bit.		MF: medium body, relatively light for the style. Medium to high carbonation.		D: this beer represents the Double Bock style in a very interesting way. The taste comes close to representing the style, but the appearance and body are much more similar to an adjunct lager. I would not try this again."
"A - Golden colored beer with a bit of a plane white head that left some decent splotches on the sides of the glass. Little wattered down looking.		S - Malts, little bit of skunk smell, touch of hops, mostly sweet malts.		T - Taste is pretty bad. Sweet malts and some skunked hops. That's really about it, not good at all. Kind of like a macro gone bad.		M - Lighter side of medium boied with moderate carbonation.		O - Pass, maybe I got a bad bottle. Kind of doubt it though as I was in Tennessee and they go through this stuff like water."
"Pours a very dark red hued brown body. Has almost no head.	Smells big and fruity with lots of hops and hints of caramel and chocolate. Some nice roasted malts underlying the hops notes.	Taste tart and full of dark crystal malts at first but it over whelming with piney hop notes. Very bitter on the end.	Mouthfeel is very smooth and thick with a sharp abv finish."
From a clear 22 oz. bottle. Pours a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malt and corn. Taste is rather yucky. Flavors of corn and alcohol. Not very pleasent in the mouth either. Drinkability is also low. Not much to recomend about this beer.
"750mL bottle served into a pint glass.		Pours murky, septic shade of brown. Ugly body. half a finger of tan head with adequate lacing. Tons of sediment all throughout the body, even on a careful pour. This does not look like something you'd want to drink.		More malty than hoppy. Apart from a distant floral astringency there are not any hops on the nose of this ""IPA."" Stale brown malts smelling mostly of breadcrust make up the vast majority of the beer's aroma. Terrible for the style, just terrible.		The taste follows the nose, only majorly improved. It is still more malty than hoppy. Some ashy, leafy dead flowers make up the hop flavors, while the malts are vaguely nutty and toasty. It sort of tastes like Diet Barleywine. Littlefoot, if you will.		The body seems pretty thin on the tongue. It is around medium bodied for the style, it's just that the lack of hops makes me think the beer would have been thicker than it is. I am glad that it isn't. Drinkability? Terrible. I would rather drainpour this than have another glass. But I guess that if you can appreciate it as a Diet Barleywine than you might be able to stomach the whole bottle. It isn't offensive nearly as much as it is boring.		Mind Numbing Ale? I suppose so; my mind is numb trying to figure out how this beer got onto the market labeled as an IPA. This is an affordable bottle but don't even waste your time with it."
"Smells ok and for the first couple of seconds after sipping it actually tastes pretty darn good - smooth and creamy - chocolaty! But immediately after that, it left a real nasty-paint-thinner-like-vinegary after taste. Couldn't finish bottle - I was VERY disappointed and decided to stick with mojitos the rest of the evening (Christmas Eve). Just for kicks, I decided to give it another shot today - no change - starts out super delicious to the palate, but finishes with a super vinegary bitter bite which literally makes you shake your head and wonder ""WTF? What happened here you dirty bastard?"" To each his/her own."
"Appearance: (3.0)	- Pours a rather clear copper. Perhaps a bit darker than a new copper penny. After seeing that it didn't have much carbonation, I immediately started a heavy pour into the glass. Perhaps a touch of off-white fizzy head appeared, but it quickly settled to the smallest half-ring, and some very small traces of bubbles on top. 		Smell: (3.0)	- Big smoke. Wonderful woody smoke, salty smoke, light grain and sweetness. Like that smell that sticks with you if you hung out by a fire burning old pallets all night. Very woody smoked scent. It is pretty much all that dominates this beer. While it smells very good, I feel the smoke dominates the smell much too much. 		Taste: (2.5)	- Huge smokey salty woody flavor, but I think the aroma might twist what one would think the true flavor is. Light grain, slighty wheaty flavor. Small touch of caramel. Bit earthy, burnt, sweet.. not much hop. Overall very smokey, and interesting... but really isn't overly good. 		Mouth Feel: (3.0)	- It's basically medium bodied, slightly syrupy, but lacks a good amount of carbonation. I feel it is kind of flat, and does wet the palate a bit because of its pallet burning presence. Eh..		Overall: (2.5)	- If you like burned wood, and massive smokey character.. this beer is for you. I feel it is way undercarbonated, may have a decent malt backbone, but is just not hitting high marks with me. I like some good smoked oak etc, age, and unique character.. but holy smokes.."
"After trying (and loving) Founder's Dirty Bastard, I decided to give this beer a try, given that it's basically a Dirty Bastard aged in bourbon barrels. I bought this beer wanting to like it, but I wound up disliking it. Here's why:		A: The appearance is the best thing about this beer. It appears opaque, but upon holding it up to a light one can make out a faint, light, ruby-colored hue on the edges. The center is still dark, however.		S: The vanilla and molasses are overpowering (emphasis on overpowering). I don't mind hints of vanilla in my beer (or molasses, for that matter), but I certainly don't want it to wreak of vanilla beans. And, rather than compliment the vanilla, the molasses winds up producing a sickly-smelling sweetness that can only be equated to old cough syrup.		T: Yes, bourbon is clearly present. Therefore, it's reasonable that the beer should taste of oak and vanilla. However, the flavors are not balanced well, and, rather than compliment the Scottish ale, the vanilla and oak (i.e., the bourbon) wind up totally masking the presence of good beer. The alcohol content - which is quite heavy - also takes away from the ale's original flavor. I like Dirty Bastard far more than this beer.		M: The mouthfeel is OK. The excess sugars give the beer a syrupy composition that lies heavily on the tongue, but the taste was so bad that I just wanted to gulp the beer down and be done with it.		O: I would avoid it, but a lot of people like this beer. I would just recommend getting bourbon, since the bourbon in this beer is so overpowering that it hinders much of the ale-taste found in Dirty Bastard."
The 2nd beer i have tried from the Trafalgar Brewing company. Again the apperance leaves much to be desired. Color was ok, a light amber/copper but the head was small & thin and gone in the blink of an eye. Smelled kind of mediciney, tastes watery and really not that great.
"Had this at the airport in Aruba		A: This beer pours a pale, translucent, straw yellow with a one finger of white head. Head recedes quickly leaving minimal lacing on the glass. 		S: Nose is mostly of a malt sweetness, perhaps caramel malts but some what different, notes of grain are also present.		T: Taste is all sweet graininess. Starts with a sweet malt flavoring that holds through the entire beer and really sticks in the finish. Middle has notes of grain and grassiness. 		M: Light bodty, moderate carbonate, crisp and clean.		D: Goes down ok, not much of a kick, nit a great representation of the style. I would opt for other choices."
"Pours a foggy mahogany color with a small, but heavily creamy tan head. Smells like sweet bourbon whiskey...oak and vanilla frosting. Some leather and dark brown sugar too. Super heavy flavor...dark caramel, lots of bourbon, vanilla woodiness, and sugary sweetness. Creamy smooth, heavy, and warming.		Super sweet, lots of whiskey...not as complex as it should be since the bourbon flavors pretty much mask most of the malt. Too sweet to drink more than one."
"The holy grail of sorts poured a bronze/honey color with a moderate head which had pretty good retention. The clarity was very good. 		The nose had about as much presence as a mute man at a yelling tournament. Some euro lager tones, lighter diacetyl, and cereal grains rounded it out. 		The flavor was very controversial IMO. Buttery flavors clashed with an almost berry like strangeness. It tasted a lot like alcohol tastes, without feeling like alcohol feels. I don't think that's how things were meant to be.... Watered down whiskey was the verdict.		The body was the highlight of the beer, not that that's saying much, but the sharp creamy body was nice. Other than that.... I'm not impressed. It's probably safe to say my quest for the Holy Grail ended in disappointment."
"A: Clear, dark orange-ammber with a small white head that quickly fades to nothing. Minimal lacing.		S: Smells oaky and malty. Almost a spoiled grain smell. Musty.		T&M: Medium bodied up front with a soapy carbonation. Some malts and hops, but nothing definitive. Watery finish.		This is definitely one of the worst craft brews I've ever tasted. I've had it on tap and in the bottle before, but nothing's changed."
pours a very dark amber color with some sediment floating around in the brew, has a big head on it. as soon as i pop the top i notice strong the smell is, its unbelievably strong, it smells like 10 year old jerky, it truly is nuts that they can make a beer like this, without adding slim jim wrappers during fermentation. the taste though is not impressive at all, the smell overpowers everything, but the taste is not very impressive. i'm not too impressed with this beer overall.
"500 ml bottle - best before 7/31/07		Pours golden yellow with a large white head. The head descends to a lasting cover. Some broken rings of lacing stick to the glass.		The smell is of grass with a chemical-like, sulfurish sweetness.		The taste is of sweet grain and hints of sour apple. Chemicalish. A slight hint of oily cedar in the finish. Hints of alcohol notes come through - more than expected for a 5.5% abv.		It has some watery thinness, though it doesn't fall apart. The drawback of the feel is the carbonation, which is a bit too much. Rather slick.		I'll pass on this in the future. A bland Euro-lager that has too much sulfur going on, and to annoyingly astringent to make it passable."
"Poured this 12 oz. brown bottle into a Sam Adams glass. No date. The body was cloudy and the color of brown leather. The modest head faded to a filmy ring.		Smell was bourbon. Only bourbon.		Taste was a bourbon smack in the face. There was a lingering sweet aftertaste.		Mouthfeel was medium to full in body. I have to say I ""don't get"" this one. Seem one dimensional to me. Too much up front bourbon flavor. I prefer muted bourbon notes, not feeling like I'm drinking a mixed drink."
Another weak pea colored brew with a white head of small to large bubbles that leaves very little lacing. It has a low quality aroma that reminds me of getting sick to my stomach. Oh not another one of these brews! It has a very small hoppy flavor smooth and with no fore or after bite. Its low alcohol content is also not a plus for me. Can I have a stout please! GF rating said it smells like cheap beer, looks like cheap beer, so it must be cheap beer! LOL.
"Sampled at The C'est What? Fall Festival of Beers. Off the bat, this drink seems to be all about alcohol. It dominates the nose, the flavour and the finish. Appearance in the glass is very dark brown, almost black. with a wispy head. the very fact that there is a head present makes me ecstatic. These guys simply cannot get a head to form, so perhaps I've over generous in my appreciation of this, but it actually looks to style.		Aroma is port mixed with rocket fuel. Shitloads of fusel alcohol. Smells worse than most things I've come across, except the hideous Church-Key creation I followed this up with. Flavour contains hints of fruit, and I say hints because again this is all about the alcohol. Some brewery's can do big beers well - these guys can barely do small ones, and this is an absolute trainwreck. The texture is standard crap from these guys...syrupy and barely carbonated. Oddly, the finish was actually very pleasant, but that was probably the buzz more than anything.		I think I'd only drink this beer in a sample size...anything bigger would be too much."
"(Served in a tulip glass)	#27-29 scratched on date of bottle 		A- This beer pours a slightly hazy orange body with a bubbly thin cream head that last a bit. There is a slow carbonation of big bubbles that glide to the surface. 		S- The soft light melanoidin note has hints of pot caramel and a soft diacetyl finish that grows as the beer opens up.		T- The slightly sweet pot caramel flavor is light and clean with a alcohol bite in the finish that leads to a melanoidin note that lingers.		M- This beer has a medium-light mouthfeel with a tight fizz and a soft alcohol bite that grows with each sip. 		O- The caramel flavors are a bit artificial tasting and the only other support is the alcohol and the fizz. It starts off ok but as it opens up it really gets an alcohol burn and fake caramel flavor."
"Elora is a place I have been to and I know they can do better than this. The can (I know a can) plays the micro brew game with ""Dry Hopped"" and ""Craft Brew"" prominent on it's cheaply designed label. it then has a difficult to read ""OCB"" emblem that on closer inspection stands for Ontario Craft Brew. Does that mean anything? To me it means pretentious crap. They then claim this is filling a gap as a ""refreshing lager for those who would like some flavour with their beer."" 	No it's not. it's not refreshing and it's no more flavourful than a puddle on the lawn. And it's not actually from Elora. it's brewed in Oakville Ontario, which is about a 100km drive away from Elora. 		They should just call this lousy lieing packaging lager and be done with it. i know I am.		Addendum; Apparently I reviewed this beer in a bottle 3 years ago and gave it a 'B'. Well neither time nor dumping it a can has it improved it a mote."
"Sweet, heavy, amber ale.		Nice amber color but head flattens out. Not much in the mouth feel. It's all in the sugar and heavy-weight flavor. Hint of dirty, earthy flavor that doesn't go well with the malt. If only this were a barley wine, you could give it another shot of hops. ""Dude, did we forget the hops?"" Which give me an idea. There's a cold bottle of Yakima Glory in the frig. This is a one-note low-fi strike down the middle. Only Scotch in this is Butterscotch.		This one is a lumbering bear of a hot, sweet drink. I'm a big malt fan but maybe this needs some crazy oriental flavors to go with it, or some seriously hot spice to cool down."
"This was the eighth most sold strong beer in Sweden in 2004 (#24 in 2003). It is also the cheapest beer available in Sweden. 		Colour is pale gold, the head is almost invisible but there are some white laces on the glass. 		The smell is watery with a curious smoked touch, some sweet malt and an overall artificial feeling. 		The taste is on the lighter side of the scale: It is almost watery. There are however frowzy notes of anonymous malt (some sweetness), a touch of margarine and some synthetic hops, the bitterness is very mild. Aftertaste got a touch of wheat flour and apricot candies.		The carbonation is plain (but not stale). Small bubbles. 		A cheap lager, in all ways. Unpleasant.		Oh yes. ""Pilsner"" in Demnark just means a ""lighter lager"" and got nothing to do with the German or Czech pilsners."
"Light, crisp and macro-clear diluted honey color. Thin, dish soap-bubbly head.		Slightly skunky aroma...standard for a Western European higher-end macro. Can smell a little Pilsener-style hop presence.		Very dry on the palate. Carbonation and hops bite in tandem for a tinny aftertaste that mellows only slightly with warmth (the skunkiness takes over after that).		Crisp on the mouth but a tingly aftertaste of industrial style hop, light malt and corn (?) mass-production.		It is what it is - a Euromacro. Tastes like it has some class but nothing I would seek out."
"650ml bottle	5.0 ABV		I tried this beer on March 19, 2008 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a translucent orangy-red colour with very little head, and a lot of effervescence. The aroma was primarily sweet malt. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, somewhat dry, and with a lot of carbonation. The flavour was mainly malt with very little else. I didn't get any rye or hoppy feel from this brew."
I purchased this bottle from my local binny's. After reading all the great reviews here i was really looking forward to this. I have to say upon trying it i am dissapointed, not a terrible beer but for the style i am dissapointed in it. It has no bourbon flavor to it, and i much prefer the goose island bourbon county stout. It lacks that creamy bourbon flavor that i expect from this style of beer. It has really strong roasty coffee flavors but that is really all it has. It has a slightly bitter and flat ending. It is extremley dark and has a brown head, which dispated pretty fast. Overall the only way i would try again is at the brewery on tap. I would still like to try some of their other beers though.
"Beer served in an imperial pint glass out of a bottle. Beer is yellow and clear, very light. Appears to have moderate carbonation, head is thin and white of medium and small bubbles. No lacing on the galss. Looks like beer.		Aroma is strong like boiled vegetables and corn, really strong a little gross.		Does not have a flavor, except for a slight after taste. Kind of gross really. Thin mouthfeel, harsh almost stringent mouthfeel. Really gross."
"Appearance: Pours a clear, orange-gold body with a thin, white head.		Smell: Aroma smelling sweetly of faintly toasted pale malts with a large note of green apple. Hmm.		Taste: Sweetish, lightly toasted malts with a minor hint of grain. Big, tangy taste of acetaldehyde coming across as crisp green apples throughout. Light hop bitterness. Still a bit of sweetness for the abrupt, apple-burdened finish.		Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium carbonation.		Drinkability: Even considering all those pesky apples, it wasn't outright terrible, but not a beer I'd ever repeat."
"From the tap, served in a pint glass.		Poured a dark cola brown with a thin foamy tan head, settled into a fine lacing, no sticking.		Too faint a nose for a porter, light scents of cocoa powder mix, toffee, a sweet fruitiness, lacking any caramel or coffee malt aromas, unimpressive.		Thin and watery tasting, medium-light bodied, dry, but light on any malty crispness, the malts are way too thin for a porter, watery cocoa and coffee beans, and I do mean watery, like if you dropped some beans in a cool glass of water and then drank it, not very appealing, a subtle, but again, watery sweet fruitiness, even for a below average porter, the hops are completely tasteless, no presence at all, a dry, watery coffee malt finish, this is disappointing, barely drinkable.		I had the Riverboat Porter last fall (2006) and it was so much better than this. O'Griff's hired a new brewmaster in the beginning of the summer and I am praying this just an oddball batch, not one of his brews. I will try this again in the late summer or early fall and re-review if necessary. A porter this bad could kill off a brewpub."
"Bottle received from bamadog in a recent trade. Thanks for the beer!		Poured into my pint glass. Pours a very cloudy dark copper with a thick beige head on top. Decent retention. Left some pretty sip rings on the glass. That was the best part of the beer. Scents of toffee, bread, and earth. Not what I would expect from an IPA. Hmm. 		Decent body on this beer. Nice mellow smoothness with a touch of carbonation play on the tongue. Flavor is weird. Dull earthy bitterness, caramel, and a slight tart funkiness on the finish. This is strange. Not sure what I think of this beer. It's interesting, to say the least. I wouldn't go out of my way to grab this one again. Too bad, I liked the other BBC brews I've had."
"poured from bottle into dimpled glass mug, served at around 48 degrees;		A - soot black with half-inch head that lasted		S - wet charcoal and smoked meat		T - smoked bacon and nothing else, boring		M - medium mouthfeel, creamy		D - none		definitely not a fan of rauchbiers, this beer's strong points are the pour and the mouthfeel, flavor is ok if you like eating your bacon off the bottom of your grill, not recommended"
"WOW...		I mean, wow....		W.T.F.		I just bought this a month ago from the brewery directly (actually my friend bought it for his non-beer-drinking wife). These are my notes:		""Tastes like cheap cough syrup and old stale Brett. Reminiscent of those old-grandma strawberry candies (with the red and green strawberry colored wrapper) except not sweet at all. A light ginger color.""		I seriously could not believe that this was the creation of Hoppin' Frog. I also couldn't comprehend that they actually were selling this AT THE BREWERY. Have some pride. Have some respect for your customer. A world-class chef wouldn't send out inedible food to a patron; I would think that a world-class brewery would operate on the same premise. This was so off-putting I was gagging after the first sip. Smelled bad, looked bad, tasted bad... awful. 		I was previously annoyed that HF didn't put some sort of bottling date or freshness date on their beers, now I'm outright pissed. Who knows how old this is... The ""berry"" flavor was clearly not from real fruit, had to be some sort of extract.		Can't believe it came to a HF beer, but to date, this now has the title of my lowest rating ever. Damn. 		Guess I can at least see why it was retired (wish I'd known before I let a friend spend good money on this though). If you come across this, don't... just don't... morbid curiosity isn't enough to warrant the waste of money this beer turned out to be.		Yack."
"I like bacon, and I like beer. But I don't like bacon in my beer.		The first thing I noticed while pouring this brown beer was the overwhelming smoked smell. This was my first smoked beer, and I was taken by surprise. Hickory bacon and barbecue sauce dominate the nose.		The taste was extremely smoky. Again, bacon, and lots of it, cooked over a campfire. Am I drinking beer or having a drunk cowboy's breakfast? I just needed to slap on some spurs and start telling folk stories around the campfire.		I couldn't finish this beer. I'll be sure to keep away from beers labeled ""smoked"" in the near future. Maybe when I'm older I'll revisit them. And maybe I'll look for ones in smaller bottles."
Poured orange amber color with a small off white head. Aroma is of super fresh hops and caramel sweetness. If this tastes the way it smelled it would be great. This is way too bitter. 168 IBU's? What the fuck. You can't taste anything let alone the caramel that you smelled in the aroma. Feel is slick and slightly watery. No this is not drinkable.
"I noticed this one on offer in the local Aldi and picked up a few bottles. The beer poured an amber - yellowish colour with a thin off white head, quiet pale for a beer.		The smell was very bland: mainly of malts and a faint hint of sweet butter scotch / toffee, difficult to tell as it was very faint.		This faint theme continued onto the taste, very watery, hardly any real taste to this beer whatsoever. A slight hint of malts and hops with a taste of fruit that was too weak to identify.		The beer was like a soft drink in the mouth, very lite and just plain unsatisfying. I finished my first bottle and gave the rest to a neighbour (who himself panned them onto visiting guests).		I may have bought a bad batch, I would like to try this beer on tap, in bottle it tasted watered down. I felt I overpaid for a drink of juice."
"Thanks to zealot for this suprise beer in a trade, I think.		Pours a thick Honey Brown with lots of floaties in this bottle. Didn't know or look out to see sediment. 		Smells like an old ale but kinda boozy. Like the drunk at the bus stop.		This might not be fair because all those yeasty floaties are giving it a very bitter taste??!! Not too good in my book. 		I think this might not be too fair because the beer may have been poured wrong, but good beer should be idiotproof. The more I drink the worse it gets, so it might not be me. No soup for you!"
"This is it ladies and gentleman, the cheapest beer on earth. 99 cents for a 51 oz plastic flip-top.		It struggles to form a head as it pours a super-pale orange.		The smell isn't that bad, it smells like maltose syrup, alcohol, and honey.		The flavor is also not garbage for the price. It is a bit flat though. It is mainly just sweet caramel and booze overtones. not any worse than a Mickey's.		This is what college kids should put in there crackpipe and smoke the living shit out of it... err their beerbongs."
I really want to like this one. Smells and looks so good. Definite pine aroma, and initially I get a solid malt sweetness balanced by the citrus (but the alcohol isn't as well hidden as some might suggest). But then the citrus changes, almost like instead of getting the zest, I got the really pungent white part between the zest and the flesh. And I can't shake the aftertaste that reminds me of a bad cigar. It lingers too.
"11.2 oz brown bottle. Best before NOV 10.		It pours a vibrant gold, the head is very adjunct lager-like and unpleasant to the eyes. It leaves some lacing.		The smell is super skunky, funny because it is a brown bottle that is also within it's due date. Do they purposely skunk it?		The flavor is watery, there is some typical macro flavors here, a slight bit of hops, not much.		Pretty bad."
"Almost black. Big Huge fizzy brown head. Good retention. Head forms craters as it dissintegrates. This beer appears to be very charged up by its appearance. Coffee bean, soap and leather are present on the nose. There's something wrong with this beer. (Actually, many things.) Mouthfeel is way too carbonated. I get so damn much gas in every gulp that a burp is always the aftermath. The taste is astringent. Husky. Tannin like. Soapy. Stale. No stout qualities to speak of. I haven't dumped a beer in months, but I just don't feel like burping 20 times by the time I finish this one.		Thanks to Davo for the sample (and burps). No fault of yours though."
"Once poured from its green bottle one has a light gold lager, with slight lacing and.	 a small head that quickly dissipates. 	Its appearance is pretty good lit by candlelight, and that's its best point.	The aroma was slightly skunky and the taste grainy. There was little carbonation.	The finish was kind of flat and dry.	Overall, not pretentious or very good. Yet this seemed to be the beer everyone was drinking, albeit the choices were very limited.	It was thirst quenching and maybe that was the real reason why I never finished a bottle."
"A: Pale golden. Typical euro lager.		S: Malt sweetness and nothing else.		T: Sweet malt and some strange fruity character which gives an unpleasant feeling back in the mouth.		O: Not what I had expected as it tastes more than a beer which some tv-character drinks. But still, the taste is not good."
"A - Poured a clear golden color with a thin white head that leaves some lacing		S - Is of sweet grainy malt		T - Has a pretty sweet taste thats not all that good		M - This beer has a light body with high carbonation to it		D - Not good I don't know how this stuff is popular with some people I guess marketing goes a long way"
"A: Mahogany in the glass; red when light shines through. Low head crouches atop my full pint, then rings the glass as I drink.		S: Mild roastiness, hints of molasses cookies. Low hops.		T: Strong flavor up front, with a grainy astringency. Some roast, but not much. A splash of chocolate in the finish, but also a licorice and a syrupy medicinal quality. None of the peat flavor I had wished would be present. Not balanced, as I had hoped--too medicinal, too syrupy, too much licorice.		M: Full mouthfeel, but harsh.		D: I only bought a single, and I'm glad I did. The flavors are all over the place, and the ones that predominate aren't pleasant. I detected slight hints of chocolate and toffee, but was overwhelmed by the harshness of it. If it weren't for the other (rave) reviews on BeerAdvocate and the fact that this beer is named as an exemplar for the style by the BJCP, I'd content myself to have tried just this one bottle. I'll probably try it again at some point, to assure myself that I didn't just get a bad batch. I suspect this beer, at 8.3% ABV, will mellow well with age."
"Stoudts focus seems to be on ales, so maybe it's not such a good idea for them to try to make a Marzen. Suffice it to say they just don't seem to be very good at it.		Had this on tap at Mahaffey's the other day.		The beer pours a brownish copper color with fair at best head retention and virtually no lacing. Frankly, the beer just looks as if it will be light and watery. I get pretty much nothing on the nose, just some light bitterness from the hops and a whiff of sweet malt. On the palate this beer tastes nothing like a German marzen. In fact, it sort of makes me think of a blend of a mediocre dunkel with a mediocre amber. The beer is pretty light and dry, with some bitterness in the finish. There's almost a burnt toast flavor to this beer.		I guess this is an attempt to make a hoppy version of a marzen. It's an interesting idea, except they didn't get the marzen part right. This beer is very light and watery, and is not very enjoyable to drink. The finish comes across as a bit short, and ultimately I just put the beer aside. There are too many other great beers in the world to waste my time with something like this. It's certainly not what I would call poison, but it just seems like a very weak effort from Stoudts, who typically make much better and more interesting beer.		Disappointing."
"Can into Whitewater brewery pint glass in low altitude Galway, Ireland. Expectations are low. I bought this because after a trip to Belgium, I noticed my average review was going up, and I figured this would be shite enough to bring it down. Will I be correct? Oh, the suspense... 		A: Pours a crap no-cream head of fair thickness. Bubbly likely overcarbonated clear dark yellow. Looks a bit like sheep piss. Four finger head of decent retention. Not terribly excited to give it a go. 		Sm: Light barley and a bit o' cream. Not particularly delightful, but not shite either. Wnderbar. 		T: Nice cream on the open and a mixed barley/malt body with maybe some crystal hops to tame her down. More complex than I expected based on the appearance and smell. Far better than American macro lagers at the same price. Finish is flat and uncharacteristic of quality. Balanced and built decently. 		Mf: Lumpy and too thick. Very poorly executed. Not watery like American macros. 		Dr: Affordable, but garbage. Don't waste yer time with this one, lads. Grab a Pacifico instead, at this price range."
"12 oz. brown bottle into a glass stein		A - Dark brown penny coloered. It took me 10 minutes to pour this beer due to the insane amount of reddish root beer-like head that would not go away.		S - Beef broth, celery. Very smoky. 		T - It would make a decent veal stock substitute. Just add some salt. I can't really detect any blackberry flavor. Unpleasant		M - I didn't really want this in my mouth for very long. If you ignore the taste, it feels alright.		D - No.		Couldn't really finish this one. Not sure what the point was."
Pilsner Urquell has a very nice in appearance in the glass, coming off with a good looking bright, golden hue. However, unless you live next to the Czech Repulic, getting one of these that is fresh and non-skunked is tough. Every time I have tried this beer, I have been disappointed in its bitter, skunked taste. I think Czechvar is better, it must be the brown bottle vs. the green.
"I had a swift half of this whilst waiting for a friend in my local in UK. 	I have not drunk this stuff since I left the Navy. Now I remember why!		A: Golden body. Heavily carbonated with a thick white head. 		S:Nothing much here. Certainly not a ""beery"" smell. 		T - Sweet malt with an unpleasant sourness. Too sweet to be a lager. no aftertaste. 		M - Extremely gassy. 		D - No thanks. I would sooner stick a needle in my eye."
"Another beer from Trafalgar and I will admit they are improving ( slowly mind you). It pours a dark black with some ruby colors as well. Has a light brown head, not the best retention for a stout and some lacing.		Smells of molasses, fruits, roasted malts and a bit of smokiness.		The taste is unbalanced (IMO). There is to much sour fruitiness ( something that I am used to by now). Also has notes of sweet malt and just a dash of smoked malt. Nothing I would drink again but still a good effort."
"I recall seeing this as a poorly rated beer in the past, but wanted to test it myself to see...		A - Pours a medium copper colour with a red hue, thin layer of head, no retention and no lacing.		S - Sour cherries, quite metallic and a bit woody. Not impressed.		T - Cherry is noticeable, but not sweet and rather sour. Caramel malts sweet corn and a bit of grassy wheat all come through as well. Not the cherry flavour I was looking for.		M - Pretty light, and a little on the watery side. Could use a bit more carbonation.		D - I tried to approach this with an open mind but was rather disappointed. I've tried better cherry flavoured offerings and I would easily recommend one of those over this one."
"Offered to me by a friend after a looong Friday at work. I needed a beer - ANY BEER - and leapt at the offer.		Started out okay. Maybe the serving should have been colder. This is not a beer that holds up well to room temperature.		Novelty of vanilla taste wore off after two or three sips. From there on out quite unpleasant, like drinking cough syrup that had a vanilla Tootsie Roll dissolved in it. 		I would not buy this beer. Gimmicky and half-baked - The Harmon should stick to the meat and potatoes instead of dopey schemes like this."
"Well first of all, I'm not a rauchbier fan, so take this review as a review from an outsider. 		The beer looks good. A little thin dark brown pour. Smells decent. If salty had a smell, it would be it. The taste is tough to swallow. Salty smoked sausage? Maybe some bacon. Tastes like beer made with day old breakfast meat. Mouthfeel comes off the same way, like you've got old liquid meat in your mouth. As a result its not very drinkable. 		The weird thing, I love grilling, bacon, sausage. Just not as part of my beer. Who knows, maybe I'll try this again when my palate is more developed. Heaven knows SN porter and stout were tough for me 10 years ago, now I love them. . ."
"Appearance: Pours a clear, faintly yellow body with not much in the way of a head beyond the horse mug on the bottle label.		Smell: Sweetish cereal aroma with vague, indistinct notes of malt and dull, limpid hops.		Taste: Faint malt character with a light cereal sweetness. A few drops of lemon juice. Light hop flavor and bitterness, but it's got a somewhat stale quality to it, too. Drying, though wholly empty finish -- it doesn't finish so much as it vanishes like a disappearing wizard.		Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied. Medium-low carbonation.		Drinkability: As I'm sure others have mentioned, it just seems like a gag beer, like something you'd purchase at Spencer's Gifts right along with a t-shirt riddled with fart jokes and a plastic stein with the word ""HO"" emblazoned on the side."
"Red color, with a lot of floating corpuscules. Decent head, almost white, quite compact.	The smell is on the floreal notes, with tea, lemon, camomile, spices. The some fruitiness, something like peach. But after all, it is really light, and not very interesting. Though, the alcohol (8.5 ABV) is not perceptible.	The same for the taste.	Nothing remarkable.	Drinkable, no more."
"Presentation: 12 oz bottle with no freshness date to be found.		Appearance: Good frothing and great head retention, the pale amber hue shows an active carbonation and a brilliant clarity.		Smell: Odd sweetness, mild fruitiness and musty husk aroma.		Taste & Mouth Feel: Lots of husk and mildly astringent tannins in the palate right from the get go. Musty husk and a dirty malt flavor, the sweetness is a bit too much. Hops stay herbal with a harsh bitterness middle to end, faint solvent alcohol shows off the 6.0% abv.		Drinkability & Notes: This brew just does not come together well, flavors seem all misplaced and it tastes like too much protein made it into the boil  add that to the herbal hop and husk and it just does not go down well."
"Poured from the 473 ml. can pictured.		To sum this beer up in one word: sweet. In more words, sickly sweet. Poured a beautiful colour with a thick head, i was initially impressed and looking forward to a taste. The beer did have a nice creamy mouthfeel, but the taste just did not work for me; too much toffee/caramel flavour and not much else. A beer that was indeed too sweet for my tastes and not for me, however I would recommend anyone to give it a try, as I think it is a beer a lot of people would like."
"Bottled on 2/3/10. 		I've had several of these over the last year and this is the last of them.		Purchased @ West Lakeview Liquors, Chicago Illinois		Price - $5.99		Appearance: Pours orange in color with a faint white cap that disappears quickly to an equally faint ring around the glass. Not quite clear, definitely has a slight haze with some fines in suspension.		Smell: Alcohol right up front, no disguising this one. Notes of bourbon, vanilla and oak come to mind. 		Taste: Just as it smells, an almost medicinal flavor. Not very good. If you like straight booze this ones for you.		Mouthfeel: Has a decent enough body with a somewhat oily residual feel. Low carbonation if any.		Drinkability: Not in my opinion. A definite sipper, probably could have had it on the rocks. I struggled to finish the bottle each time I experienced it.		I appreciate the effort in producing it, however it just isn't for me."
"On cask at Flying Saucers firkin friday, served in a shaker pint...		A- Pretty damn black, slight brown edges. Absolutely zero head or anything. 		S- Cherries are there, but not in force. Roast hits before the fruit, but overall its slightly sweet and faint in aroma.		T/M- Well, not what I expected. Bland, dull, watery. What, did they put 1 cherry in the cask? Doesn't even resemble regular Onward, let alone the wonderful concoction it could be with cherries. I guess there is a slight cherry cough syrup flavor left over on the tongue that doesn't mix well with the minimal roast. On cask its much more medium bodied than regular Onward, but still its just bland and missing a lot.		O- Even for a cask this beer was dull. Just disappointing. Its a giant black hole in a glass; nothing is there... Yazoo- thank you for trying, but go balls to the walls next time, please!"
"Opalescent deep garnet color on the pour with a head that is frothy in ture, the size monstrous and the lace in thick clinging sheets. Toasted grains with light chocolate tones also noticed. Starts a bit sweet, mostly malt, the top cadaverous, finish is pleasantly hopped, potently acidic, the aftertaste quite dry. ""Stout in name only, way to watery, little malt to speak the only thing that even makes it drinkable is a pleasant hop bite. Riverside beers, et al have been Habeas Corpus Beers as in Wheres the Body?"
"A- Pours a really dark ruby red. Pretty much no head just a few bubbles. Same goes for lacing.		S- Smoke everywhere here and can't pick up much else. 		T- Again smoke everywhere on this one and that's all I taste. 		M- Medium in both body and carbonation.		D- Read about the style and it says acquired taste, well isn't that the truth."
This flat, insipid, straw blonde pilsner showed not a shred of suds and was watery with minimal expression in any direction. Someone was clearly not paying attention to details here. Though the flavor was not overtly corrupted, the beer was all but comatose and shouldn't have been served publicly.
"The colour is deep brown-red; the head is pale brown airy and finger thick. Almost no lacing. 		The smell is malty with some sweet roasted notes. A light metallic bitterness and a touch of alcohol are rounded by a note of dark rye bread and gravy. 		The taste is quite mild with notes of nuts, wet paper and dark bread. Although lots of flavours, it kind of lacks complexity and depth. The aftertaste got flavours of gravy, boiled meat, bread, buttery hints and an anonymous bitterness. The finish is short and simple with some butter.		The carbonation is medium strong; very small bubbles. The liquid is light. 		A simple beer that tries to be a microbrew. Not very impressive."
"I had high hopes for this beer when it poured out of the bottle into the glass. It was gold-amber with a nearly brilliant body and great head formation with bubbles that seemed to swirl in the glass in the 2 inches below the head in a way that was reminiscent to me of beer from a beer engine. Sadly, that is where the good times ended. Aroma is pretty lackluster, with some maltiness and faint hop notes. Flavor is more malty than hoppy, but really dominated by diacetyl and a weird metallic taste.		I'd counsel you to avoid this one. Life is too short and alternatives too plentiful to drink APA/IPA/DIPAs that are at best mediocre."
"Thanks to either Dan or Tim for sharing this bottle. 		I could go on about the spices of this beer and how it wasn't well balanced but honestly, all I want to say in this review is that this beer smelled and tasted like your old great aunt Mildred's Christmas Potpourri, you know the one with the pine cones, cinnamon sticks, clove studded oranges and dried flowers covered in a shiny red glaze and sparkly glitter. The brewers of this beer must have dry-hopped with this stuff, how else could they have nailed it so perfectly?"
"Bottle to pint glass. Bottled on 5/19/10, reviewed on 7/10/10.		A: One and a half foamy fingers accumulates on a vigorous pour. Cumulus cloud white in color. Diminishes quickly but the film is long lasting and so is the collar. The body is vibrantly clear, light orange with a hint of crimson red. Pretty. Spare splatters of would-be lacing try to stick but can't. Small, dark particles have settled at the bottom of the glass. 		S: Toasted malts of indistinguishable variety with a light grassy hop contribution. The nose is dominated by sour cherries. Fermented fruit funkiness as well.		T: Fresh Michigan tart cherries were added at 5 different stages throughout the brewing process, which was about 4 stages too many. The flavor is overwhelmingly cherry dominant. I expected more subtlety from Founders. Barely recognizable flavors of grenadine, strawberry, pomegranate, cranberry and cinnamon flavored candy come in to play.		M: Medium-light body with a thin, slick, syruppy, cloying texture. Not good. At all. Fine fizzy carbonation is of average intensity. Heavy sweetness is only withstandable because the tartness begins to cut through it.		D: My first drainpour. I'll put a bucket next to my bed tonight. Just in case."
"Brown 0.5 litre bottle, BBD is smudged so not sure if the beer was in date or not.		Poured into a pint pot (glass).		Dull, deep old gold colour, typical of an O'fest bier. Good white foaming head sat on top.		Cut grass is the first aroma followed by bad Body Odour, then I wanted to smell hops, yeast and malts. Sadly I didn't although a none discript beery aroma did appear.		This beer (according to the label) won some accolade at the Beer world Cup in San Diego 2008. whoever voted for it has different taste buds to me.		The richness I remember from O'fest biers and the depth of flavours were not present in this version. A weak attempt of the style in my opinion. Dry and bland throughout."
"A- Pours an odd reddish color with nice creamy head. Head has ok retention and leaves very little lacing. 		S- Smells very sweet. I picked up the cherries right away and know I was in trouble. Also picked up a bit of booze and wood. Not a fan of cherries. 		T- There it is the ultra sweet fake cherry taste that I hate. I can't really taste too much else here and not really picking up any booze at all.		M- Medium in body and carbonation.		D- I couldn't finish my glass. I'll pass on this one."
"A friend gave me a bottle of this for Christmas. I have my doubts, but I'll give it a try... Decanted into a pint glass. Lots of foam on the pour, which descends quickly, and leaves the beer a mostly clear pale yellow. Only a very thin white ring of lace left.		Smell is pretty simple: bread, honey, and a musty quality. A little chemical-y, too. Like formaldehyde.		Taste is not good. Starts out with a touch of honey sweet, then quickly becomes a mash-up of sour bitterness. Like a really sharp sourdough bread, but not in a good way. Fortunately, the flavors fade quickly. But they leave a sort of chemical coating on your tongue - at least it feels that way.		Mouthfeel is just really fizzy, but only briefly. Then it's just watery.		I can't really drink much of this beyond the sips it's taking me to review this beer. Just too many bad flavors at work. You can pass on this one."
"Appearance: brilliantly clear golden amber color, fine white head.		Aroma: fresh grassy hop aroma, slightly piny. Otherwise cool-smelling, not a lot of malt in the nose.		Taste & mouthfeel: chunky hop flavor kind of burns the tongue, exacerbated by the high carbonation level. Body is a bit thin, but in a refreshing way. The above-average alcohol content actually doesn't burn at all, which is nice.		Drinkability: the hop aftertaste is actually a bit sour, and would definitely hold me to a single quaff of this run-of-the-mill amber ale.		[From notes]"
Much better than the ghastly Light version. Poured with a huge foamy, frothy, sudsy, fluffy, white head that lasts and lots of lace. Color is a clear yellow gold with some bubble trails. Aroma is a mild skunk hop malt. Flavor is more bitter than sweet, but still not a lot there. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and short. Drinkable beer if other options aren't so good.
"despite the relatively high reviews for this beer, i was not impressed. granted, i may have had a bad bottle, but when it settled out in my glass, there were a lot of suspended solids in the brew. granted, i don't think they changed the taste or mouthfeel of the beer *too* much, but something just isn't right about seeing little brown flecks in a glass of beer.		the beer pours a deep amber color and settles into a medium-dark copper. it's smell is sweet, but rather fruity and light. the head over the ale is chalk white and seems to stay on the beer for virtually as long as you'll leave it sitting on the counter. the beer itself starts smooth with a slight hoppy bite. it is medium bodied with a gummy texture and a hint of spice. this ale finishes crisp with a distinct weight to the aftertaste. it is somewhat drinkable, but it doesn't quite match up to other pale ales i've tried.		overall not a bad beer, with an enjoyable kick, but not something i'd pick out of a lineup again."
"A: Pour is a cloudy amber with a thin head. Limited lacing.		S: The nose is of some citrusy hops, but not all that pleasant.		T: Piney hops leading to heavy malts. Again not an example of my favorite blend.		M: Body is fine.		D: Not a great beer for the money, sorry."
"It appears an orange red color with almost no head. There is just a thin lining of off colored white foam. 	Smells strongly of nutty caramel malts. There is also a strange cinnamon smell to the beer. It smells similar to a strong double bock. There is something weird about the smell. 	After the weird smell I am a bit afraid to actually taste this. The strange cinnamon taste dominates the taste there is a bit of caramel malt flavor. This is not as sweet as I thought from the smell. It's very weird tasting. Only malts are noticeable in the taste. There is a slight metallic taste to the beer as well. I am not sure I want to drink all of this. 	The carbonation I guess is very low because it has the mouth feel of water. The mouth feel just makes the flavors seem nastier. 	Due to the nasty mouth feel and weird flavor its drinkability is not very good.	Overall a weird malty beer that is quite repulsive. It was quite cheap but it is still quite nasty. I might be able to finish this but it will be a struggle."
The pour is a lovely pale straw. There is little to no head to speak of. Flavors and aromas are grainy/husky and a touch sweet. In the mouth the beer is nearly void of flavor-just a mild kiss of that thing called beer. If served ice cold in Yuma Arizona on a hot August night it might just hit the spot. But, here in Chicago Sept 11 2004 the beer is simply a tasteless yellow fizzy.
"Appearance - Dark looking double IPA. A dark amber color with an orangish tint to it. Head was very thin and only came to a half finger head. White halo crowns the top of this one.		Smell - Very crisp and piney at first, but after a while a definite thick malt comes through. Sharp and citrusy as well with a flashing spiciness.		Taste & Mouthfeel - Like an oil spill in my mouth! Very slick with a medium carbonation. This beer has a puckering tang to it that over powers your taste buds most of the way. Sweet caramel malt combines with a citrus fruitiness for a little taste of something else. Alcohol is somewhat pronounced with a tiny bit of breadiness.		Drinkability - This is not my cup of tea. Way to oily and pungent for a double IPA. Was expecting more of a hop bitter than a sour bitter. I'll pass on this one again as there are far better double IPA's to be had."
"Golden color. Light perlage, creamy head on the top, not very compact on the sides. Quite thick.	In the smell an annoying sweetness, and note of soda.	The taste is sweet too, poor, with a clear metallic note. Heavy, not inviting. Quite carbonated, too.	Dominant sweetness in the aftertaste, and even here, a clear metallic taste."
"A - Clear and copper in color. Barely a thin little head.		S - Mostly cherries with a malty backdrop.		T - Cherries, watery and slightly sour with a bitter finish		M - Highly carbonated with an aftertaste reminiscent of an artificial sweetener.		No. Can't see myself trying to drink this one again."
"Weird mix on my reviews. I wanted to grade this beer for its intentions and I think other reviews were unfair.		The apprearance is a brown with a thin tan head that fades fast but leaves ok lace.		The aroma is amazing. It smells like the cordials my grandfather gave my grandmother for Valentines. It smells exactly like they intended. Milk chocolate and marchino cherries. A slight vanilla hint.		The taste is totally disappointing. Hints of chocoalate are nice in an overall average amber beer taste with cherry extract. Nothing complicated and very imitation tasting.		The mouthfeel is average. Not watery, but thin enough.		Overall, I won't buy again."
"So they call this the ""Beer Drinker's Light Beer."" I'd have to say that there is no such thing. It's a fairly clear brew, not really skunky, with very little head( which disappears quickly without much lacing). It beats all other light beers in terms of flavor, but then again, when you're drinking a light beer you really don't want much flavor, cause you either want to get drunk or are eating a powerfully heavy meal. Very mildly hoppy, and I'm told quite lame when compared to the real Amstel lager. If you're looking to step up to something better, or on that Atkins diet plan, this would be a good choice."
"500ml bottle	6.90 % ABV		I tried this beer on March 12, 2008 after purchasing from one of the local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a very dark translucent (when held against the light) reddish brown. The head was tan-coloured. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and medium carbonation. The aroma and the flavour were both grainy malt in all it's glory. Almost a chewy maltiness."
"This is my first time reviewing a beer. I have read the reviews from other Beer Advocates and maybe I'm missing something. This one rates an A average.		From the moment the cap was removed, all I could smell was smoked ham and beef jerky. Not appealing to me when I am thinking of a beer. 		The color was very appealing, but that was all.		When I gathered the nerve to take a drink and really sink my teeth into this beer, it felt like I was drinking a beef jerky smoothie. It literally made my stomach crawl. 		I actually poured this one down the drain and grabbed a reliable ""Arrogant Bastard Ale"" to bring my taste buds and sense of smell back to normal. 		I do not recommend this beer. Sorry Germany...It's a no for this beer fan..."
Bottle: Poured a deep clear golden color ale with a medium pure white foamy head with minimal retention and not much lacing. Aroma of sweet adjunct is not too strong but not that pleasant either. Taste is also dominated by sweet adjunct with light cardboard notes. Body is slightly oily with medium carbonation. Not something I really cared about or that I would need to revisit again.
"Sample at C'est What's fall festival.		A: Hazy straw, white head, some retention, good lace.		S: Grainy wheat, tart, spicy, acidic, vanilla.		T: Grainy wheat, some acidity. Very little sweetness, the vanilla doesn't seem quite right.		M: light body, very dry, moderate carbonation.		D: I prefered not to finish the small sample."
Standard pale fair here. Smell of veggies and corn, bit of skunk. This a basically a light version of a Heineken, but with less skunk. Flavor is dominated by corn, not as 'adjuncty' as domestic light lagers. Avoid if you can, if you must go light and you're not paying for it, go for this one.
"Citrus and too bitter. Could not finish my sample. Hop aroma, nothing else. Where's my malt? Medium bodied. Wood, grass, I don't know what other particles, bad herbal tea. In fact, took a tea to clean the palate after this one.	Hooray! Hooray! Another IPA. Radekfest 05 sample 31."
Raspberry juice in color with a small and quickly diminishing head. Medicinal fruit aroma, raspberry mainly, but a hint of cherry as well, with light hints of malt and hops barely showing through the fruit aroma. Flavor is overwhelming with raspberry and although it is quite vibrant, I cant say I enjoy the malt and hop combo. Light caramel and cookie-like malt is present on the palate as well. Overall, I found it to be a nice alternative to American wheat beer
"Poured into a snifter. Pours a jet black with a light mocha, oily head of about two fingers. Head is quick to drop to a wisp, with some light lacing and some legs.		Aromas of dark roast malt, dark roasted coffee, some dark cocoa, week vanilla, and some oakiness. 		Flavors of light roast, vanilla, oak, dark cocoa. Finish is short, with vanilla, oak and roast malt on the linger. Some alcohol evident as it warms.		Mouthfeel is relatively thin. Some oaky astringency dries out the mouth with a decent level of carbonation.		Overall, not much to set this one apart. No real flaws, just nothing to really grab you, smack you around and introduce you to its mother."
Why do breweries bother with light beer? I know, for the executive on the go who doesnt want to feel filled up. Have a club soda instead! Appearance of this Light beer is almost clear water with a drop of yellow, not much foam and no lace. Aroma is that of the usual brussel sprouts and eau de skunk. Initial taste consists of watery malt, some grain, metallic alum in the middle, and a hint of some hops that strayed here accidentally. Way too expensive for the bitter aftertaste it leaves behind.
"I was excited to get one of these along with two other craft beers for a kate the great (yes it was a legit and great trade..abyss and sexual chocolate) I was going to save this for a while but after much consideration.. I needed to try it. Bottle is from 2009. Initial pour gave way to relatively no head what-so ever. Copper in color. The smell is absolutely amazing. Smells of sweet fruit.. almost like a fruit roll up.. oddly enough. There are also scents of caramel. At 12 percent the alcohol is rather non existent in the nose. knowing it was aged in maple bourbon barrels i am able to smell undertones of bourbon. Taste.. pretty good..nothing to really write home about. I felt as though the taste did not really reflect the smell at all. Its rather bitter and woodsy. As for mouthfeel... slightly carbonation.. finishes kind of rough.	I could drink maybe one or two snifters of these then sadly i feel id get bored with it.		Do I suggest... ehh."
"Tasted in Taba, Egypt.		Typical lager appearance, pale golden with bubbly head that quickly disappears. Level of carbonation very high.		Start spritzy, sweetish. Body light, malty with a growing hoppy note. God knows what kind of hops it is. Finish bitter, aftertaste somewhat stale.		Not recommended to assertive travelers. Will pass as a thirst-quencher only."
"A random pickup from the LCBO. Best before date of November 2010.		Pours a dark amber with a finger of white head. Plenty of lacing. Color is disappointing. I was expecting something darker.		No discernible scent whatsoever.		Tastes like an amber ale with maybe a hint of cherry. If it was a blind test, I probably wouldn't have noticed the cherry. Amber flavoring itself is subpar.		Overall, a very poor beverage. It was just so unappetizing that I couldn't be bothered to finish it."
"Horse Piss Beer from Bluegrass Brewing Company poured straw gold and slightly hazy topped by a tall, rocky, white head. Citrus aromas of lemon zest and lemongrass. Flavors of hay, with a corn sweetness. Sharp bitterness comes and goes. Body is fairly light with high carbonation and a dry finish.		I got this bottle from my cousin. He was amused by the name and was impressed with the beer. I am not as impressed."
"A- It pours a nice head that leaves vary quickly and leaves no lacing. It has a pitch black body.		S- I get just a faint smell of coffee and a little bit of a bourbon to it.		T- Tase is vary dissapointing it's a real bland taste. I taste coffee and maye a kick from its ABV. It's also has a little metalic feel too. There is jut not alot going on with it.		M- It's a real light feeling beer it dosn't feel like I'm drinking a stout.		D- I could drink it again but I wouldn't want to. I'm sure I could find something better. This could be a really good beer. They just haven't found the right combination fot it yet."
"12oz bottle consumed at work (I have a cool job).		This beer pours the same as anyother beer of the style: straw yellow. The moutfeel is very thin, but there is substantial hops (again for the style) to go along with an upfront sweetness. This is not a good beer, but it is not a bad light lager."
Single finger head, no lace on a clear golden body. Aroma is mostly malt and breads. The aroma doesn't forbids the flavor which is smokey and burnt toast like. Otherwise typical lager yeast in the background. Light body and moderate to high carbonation. Very unique beer. More like a rauchibair but not as drinkable as a typical helles lager
"A - Clear, but very dark, red. Big spongy head that doesn't retain well.		S - Sweet malty aromas with a touch of toastiness.		T - Very sweet up front. Roasted bitterness is present, but not so much with the hops. Seems a little too sweet, even for the style.		M - Heavy/chewy. Very viscous mouthfeel. Medium carbonation.		D - High in alcohol and overly sweet. Not the most drinkable beer. Limit is probably 1 or 2 per sitting."
"bought this growler at the Party Source in Newport Kentucky. They had the Avery Mephistopheles lable on the growler station but it's actually this. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have bought this.		A vividly orange/red liquid with little white head that has less retention. Not much in way of lacing either.		Sweet peach, nectarine, belgian spice, freshly cut grass, other sweet summer ripened fruits. Lacks in any depth of aroma but the sweet fruity-ness is quite nice.		Very alcoholic, with trend towards spicy, belgian yeasty approach. Very unbalanced however. Little in way of a floral hop, with a one sided sweet malt that doesn't lend it's hand towards depth.		Thin and weak. Not the best BBC beer out there."
Poured out a murky shitty peach color, like rotton peach color, with a thin off white head. The nose has bitter prune, alcohol, some light malt, and sherry. The taste is tastes a bit like a dirty ashtray, rotten fruit flesh, and obvious alcohol. Mouthfeel has adecent carbonation, but also a little bit of a cloying, lingering feel. Not what I would consider drinkable.
"Appearance: Hazy. Slight head. light tan colored. not too appetizing		Smell: Best part of this beer. Nice hop and malt aromas.		Taste: Astringency. Very puckering Hops taste of tea. This is a sorry IPA. 		Mouthfeel: Puckering. Light for an IPA.		drinkability: Stay away. Much better IPA's out there to try!"
"I remember this beer having a head when it was fresh, but 6 months later it disappears quickly and completely. Not really an issue though.	Not much maple in the aroma. Butterscotch, fusel alcohol, and bourbon most apparent with a little fruitiness. Tastes about the same, which is a little disappointing because I was really hoping for heavy maple and mild bourbon. Wheat is absent. The alcohol overwhelms the rest of the flavors, but not so much it drowns them out. It's actually quite tasty, though it looks bad in print. This beer feels good on the palate but is just a little too thin to support itself.		This is a good beer, and if it were not so damned alcoholic, it would be a great beer. I'm afraid that by the time the heat dies down, the flavors from the oak will be quite faded. To age, or not to age? Apparently neither."
"It's more copper than bronze, and the two-finger head has lasting power. I must admit I'm skeptical about this one. Perhaps it's too many ""Hop___""s here recently that have tried (in vain) to be Hopslam or Hop Stoopid. Thus far, nothing's close. Only after the pour do I realize it's a doppelbock. I guess it's appropriate to give a dopplebock a hoppy name? I judged from the name that I had an IPA--it surprised me by looking more like a red, but I'll chalk that up to the beer style misunderstanding.		Smell offers nothing of significance. Skepticism grows. It doesn't smell bad, but it doesn't smell good. It smells like an amber. I still feel like I'm dealing with more of a red (my ignorance about dopplebocks might be rearing its ugly head) and, quite frankly, I'm disappointed. A ""Smooth Hoperator"" with no hop aroma? I feel like I'm giving this beverage the benefit of the doubt with only an average rating.		I taste roasted malts. It's nothing to write home about. Even as I try to disregard the disappointment associated with my flawed expectations, I struggle to embrace anything in the taste of this beer. I take another sip and wonder how/why in the world this beer has earned an A- on this site. I detect maybe a tad of caramel sweetness that I figure is owed to the style. Though I haven't had many, I rank this lowest among the dopplebocks I've tasted. It's not sweet, not sour, not hoppy...there's nothing distinctive about it. In my book, that makes for a subpar beer.		The mouthfeel is a dry, malty one. Though I've divulged my knowledge on the style is limited, I'd guess this beer intended to be somthing it's not. I keep wondering how/why it got its name. As I look for positives, I offer that the carbonation level seems appropriate.		Drinkability is where I'll let the beer have it. ""Smooth Hoperator"" is a stupid name for this beer. If there's a pun worth associating with this beer, it should involve ""malt"" instead of ""hop."" It's not tough to drink, but it ain't smooth either. This might be my first Stoudts review and I know fans abound, but I've yet to encounter something worth remembering."
poured a nice enough copper with a khaki head with average dissipation. Smell was of apricots with alcohol notes. Taste was grains and alcohol, kind of like whiskey in carbonated water, it had an alcohol finish. I'm sure some will like the 8.2% abv and the artwork on the bottle, but these do not a great beer make.
On tap at Lynx Pizza just outside Denali national park. The color is a reddish copper with minimal head and a bit of delicate lace. Do they use lace on kilts? The smell is rose hips and smoky malt. Now we're getting more Scottish. The taste has a nice hops bite followed by a sharp malt. Very dry finish. Not at all sweet, which surprises me a bit. The mouthfeel is nice but with minimal carbonation, although that could be the tap. There is some silkiness there to keep it all together. The drinkability is limited by the bone-dry finish but the malt balances that out as best it can before it is overrun. Not my favorite style but an interesting example of it. The alcohol is well hidden.
"The brewers tried too hard with this beer and came up short. Pours a fairly turbid pinkish red with no head. In fact there is hardly any carbonation at all. The flatness greatly diminshes its drinkablity. Smells very fruity. Tastes almost like raspberry juice; a bit overdone in my opinion. There was a lot of flocculance in my glass, again distracting. The lack of carbonation really kills this beer."
"A: Pours a dark brown color. Nearly opaque. A one finger white head forms, but recedes to nothing in a second. Not much lace is left behind.	S: Sweet malt for sure. Moldy wood and cooked veggies. I can't get anything else.	T: Sweet malt. Lightly toasted. Some grainy flavors. Slightly astringent, and some cooked veggies that follows the nose. 	M/D: A medium body and carbonation. Though on the lighter and watery side. Not something I am coming back to.		Sub oar in any regard. Not a DoppleBock, and not all that enjoyable. Not something I would recommend."
"Appearance - Crystal clear, light gold with a frothy white head that quickly dissapates. Some lacing. Maybe a notch above average for style.		Smell - Stronger than most lights, i.e. you can actually smell this. Aroma itself is nothing special - regular macrolager maltiness. Slightly above average simply because it's detectable		Taste - Very crisp and dry because this is very watery. Just a hint of malty sweetness and just a little lemony hops - balanced. Malt tastes toasted or maybe just corny, different from American macrolager. Almost seems like this could be a quality lager if not so watered down. Definitely tends toward the low-carb, low-flavor side of the light lagers.		Mouthfeel - Watery and highly carbonated like one would expect. 		Drinkability - This one loses a point for being pretentious. Pretty decent light lager, especially considering how low-cal and low-carb it is. Several notches above Michelob Ultra."
This poured into a pint glass with a thick chug. The head was thick and foamy and the color is dark copper unfiltered with large bits of yeast floating around. The aroma is of flower blossoms and sweet malt, a little alcohol and sugar starch. The taste is bitter up front followed by a rush of sweet unfermented starches. A big slick mouthfeel make this one a definite sipper. Interesting @ best. Not unpleasent, but I like others much more.
"(Served in an American pint glass)		A- This beer pours a pale straw yellow body with a slight haze and tiny bubbles gliding through it. There is a spongy white head that last for a few sips and then is gone. 		S- The faint smell of leaves and raw grain are soft and the overall smell is pretty clean. 		T- The light pale malt flavor has a slight sweetness to it with a slight tart note of buckwheat to follow. There is a soft dry sulfur note at the finish with a slight herbal quality. The herbal note increases as the beer warms. 		M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with a clean finish.		D- The smooth but slightly tart flavor has a nice start but the whole flavor and aroma is a bit dull. The flavor and aroma are very clean and need a little something to add interest."
"(Re-review 07/10/07- A/3.5 S/2 T/1 M/3 D/1) From the tap, sampled in a pint glass. This batch is different from the last time I tried this, and it has turned for the worst. Had a reddish golden appearance with a foamy white head, not a bad start. The smell is an overly sweet candied strawberry and not very subtle, no wheat malts scent at all. Plenty of carbonation and a medium-light body, but the taste is repellent, an cheap, tart hard candied strawberry flavor that dominates everything with an artificial flavoring/sweetner twang, just hideous, nothing from the wheat malts, no balance in the taste, no real ale flavor, more like a bad soda, which for me, makes this undrinkability. O'Griff's has just hired a new brewmaster and I'm hoping he didn't brew this, awful, just awful.		(A/3.5, S/3, T/3, M/3.5, D/3.5, Rating/3.2, sampled on 04/29/2006)	From the tap, served in a standard bar pint glass. Made a decent appearance, poured a hazy golden hued orange with a small foamy white head that settled into a thin foamy lacing, moderate carbonation overall. Had a sweet fruity wheat malty nose with a subtle strawberry aroma. A crisp, smooth light bodied mouth feel, above average drinkability. Sweet fruity wheat malty taste, light strawberry juiciness, not too sweet, a nice crispness from the malts, and a dry softly sour fruity, malty finish. 	Light and refreshing, a good balance between wheaty ale flavors and the strawberry fruitiness."
"A - Orangey/Amber... little to no head to speak of. Slight lacing.		S - Love the hoppiness, but not digging the intense malts. Reminds me more of a barleywine than the listed ""triple"" IPA.		T - Pretty complex and alcohol only noted in the tummy. Complex hops ride a malty wave right down, with a slight burn on the finish. Tasty, but a little too overdone. Mostly fruity, citric overtones with a sweet malt undertone. Resinous and leaves a great coating.		M - Syrupy and thick. Medium carbonation.		D - It's pretty heavy and high in alcohol. A sipper. I'll drink this one and probably not revisit this until next years batch."
"A very novelty of a name for this beer. 		Straw colored body hosts an inch of off white head that only stays a couple of minutes. Wow... the nose does have a hint of... well piss, or at least ammonia, and notes of stable wet straw and wheat. As it enters the mouth I think of chewing on a piece of straw during a hay ride. Hop notes are very under developed and mellow. Mineral notes are plentiful. Mouthfeel is soft with clean rocky notes. Notes of raw beans come through on a second run through the palate. Overall easy to drink but hard to enjoy."
"Bottled in July 2010, consumed in December 2010.		Pours from a 12oz bottle into a fluted pint glass. When I popped the top, there was a loud fizz sound and that generally doesnt bode well. Pours a thin looking, very carbonated pitch black color with a thin and infected-looking tan head. As a homebrewer, I have seen beers with infections and this one doesnt look promising. 		Aroma was mild mannered and luckily, without infection. Smells salty and battery-like. A bit of roasted frain with minimal bouron aromas. Slight vanilla.		Pretty decent flavor. Good roastiness, burnt grains, chocolate, vanilla, oak. The bourbon flavor slowly exudes after this one warms up, making this barely passable as a bourbon style stout. 		The mouthfeel on this one was the worst part about this beer. Way overcarbonated and chalky. Thus, this beer is tough to stomach. I can feel the gasses expanding in my nether regions, and it aint pretty. Not worthy."
I liked this more than the Zagloba but it was still a slightly below average beer. I had the can version and it poured a golden color with a thick white head and lively carbonation. Faint hops aroma. A little on the weak side flavor-wise, it was mostly hops and metal. Dry finish. I won't bother with this one again.
A light golden appearance, arctic-white foam and long lasting lace. Aroma is of grass, toasted grain and hops. There may be a hint of malt, but not much. Initial taste is grass, grain, some skunky hops and malt are present but only moderate. Too much carbonation. Not much flavor, but leaves a less than great taste in the mouth. There are better pilsners out there.
"Purchased in Durban South Africa. 340ml bottle poured into a Guinness glass.		a - Pours a pale straw color, clear with medium head.		s - Smells of grain, very faint.		t - Grains and a hint of hops. Clean finish but not much more flavor than the generic adjunct lagers.		m - very light bodied and medium carbonation, crisp.		o - Drinkable but forgettable. Marginally better than the standard SAB lagers available in South Africa."
"12oz bottle - Small & local, the way it should be - No idea of freshness - Poured into a pint glass...		Pours a slightly hazy golden amber with one finger of soft white head which vanishes into a cap of haze...		No idea of freshness, damn. I hate not knowing when I beer was bottled...smells pretty fresh though. Slightly citric hops with a bit of sweet malt. A bit floral. Pretty good...		A bit soapy at first, dry and bitter. Floral and earthy with a citrus twist. Bitter. Dry. Not much of a presence from the malts. Still a bit soapy. Not bad but could use a bit of a sweet malt boost...Is it fresh?		Medium bodied and well carbonated. Full amount of flavor and relatively easy drinking. Bitter and dry lingering...		Pretty good beer from a local place. But breweries, PLEASE DATE YOUR BOTTLES! At least Pale Ale's, I hate not knowing if I am drinking a fresh example of a beer. This day in age it should not be difficult for all breweries, small and large to date their bottles (or at least give us a range)...Drinkability score suffers because of this..."
Pours a clean pale yellow color with a small white head. In the aroma, faint sweetness to a standard European lager. In the taste, dry malt and a small bite, but thin and not much going on. A small bite and light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry standard lager kind of aftertaste. Nothing too exciting here, I guess that is why I don't golf!
"A - Clear Amber with ~1 finger of head. No lacing.		S - Little bit of butter and alcohol. Mild skunky smell, not all together pleasant.		T- Buttery (in a good way), lots of alcohol, sweet, sugary, grainy almost.		M - Light for the alcohol content.		D - I finished the pint but it was a lot of alcohol. Will not be having again."
"From the 40 ounce bottle no. Sep0709-DO5112102. Sampled on July 30, 2009. 		Ah St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor; the last beer that did me in...made me hug the toilet...and caused me to pass out. And that was ages ago. I have not touched it since but I figured it was time to rate it so I had to twist off the top and dive in. It was unimpressive then and it is unimpressive now. It pours yellow with about two fingers of bubbly, white head and decent clarity. It looks like it is supposed to so I rate it average. The aroma emits a scent of corn, malts, and strong alcohol. The mouthfeel is a bit better than water but still pretty weak. It tastes like a sour, metallic shot of alcohol and leaves a bad aftertaste. It is a cheap way to get a buzz if that is what you are in the mood to do."
"The pic up for this beer currently isn't the most recent label, no longer do they say what kind of beer it is directly, but instead only say: ""roasty-chewy-robust-judicious-creamy-bold-complex-immense"" and leave you to figure out it's a porter from that. 	into a snifter at around 60f.		Thin head that fades very quickly over a dark brown body, leaves just a thin collar around the edges.	Aroma and flavor both have a light chemical presence to it coming from under the other flavors. Not super strong but it takes away from this beer. They used a decent amount of roasted malts, this doesn't hit campfire status. some powdered chocolate.	feels kinda thin in the mouth with a moderate amount of carb.		This one is a bit under par in a few aspects.	this was my last bottle of the 6-pack. wont be getting more. to many other good midwest porters out there."
I would have to say that this is a beer one could get drunk to really fast, lets say 3 of these along with a couple of low point beers would get you shotally titfaced. I cannot say I would buy this one again. but I dont remember too much of the night when i started it out with this one.
"Let's se. the G and R are crossed off on the label to suggest that this is Monty Python's Holy Ail...well, that's not promising, is it? Let's drink away, anyway...	Clear, amber color, decent thick froth atop.		Aroma: nothin'...a light fruity, citrusy-ness, but so mild, that it's really nothing...didn't I say that?		Taste: ever-so lame...sorry, nothing to recommend here...in fact, it feels like a joke. Not much of an ale, certainly not the type that the knights of the round table would make a fuss over...the citric/sour qualities take over, and it's not a pleasant drink at all....if they make the effort to ink a deal with the Python boys, why not brew something worth drinking? this, however, is not,... worth one try, and then, regrets away, we move on..."
"Got this one supermarket in Budapest.		Light golden colour, foamy head which dissipates pretty fast, no lacing. Quite strong grassy hops, a bit skunky. Taste is a bit watery, mostly sweet malty with quite strong metallic feel.		I did not enjoy this one, it feels too bland and watery."
"A- Thin off white head. Cloudy brown body with a bit of amber in it. Basically no lacing.	S- Strong alcohol. Almost like perfume. Some rich fruits and other rich smells. Can't really pin point it since it's not a pleasant smell at all.	T- The taste really follows the smell. Not in a bad way. Light alcohol. Has the perfume taste. It's really different and not to good. 	M- Medium to full body very light carbonation.	D- Don't like this at all and don't see me making it all the way through."
"A: Deep brown red, barely any head		S: Nutty, smoky, malty, bourbon, molasses		T: Tastes a bit like a watery bourbon cocktail. Tastes sloppy. The bourbon flavor is overwhelming. Why do I only taste the bourbon and not any of the awesome base beer here? Doesn't work.		M: Mouthfeel is too thin , a bit too dry, not melded together well. Tastes like a mixed drink gone flat.		O: Overall, I really did not enjoy this beer, a rarity as I always enjoy Founders beers. I don't get the melding of flavors, they don't seem to work in my opinion. I love Dirty Bastard, but do not dig this."
"Appearance- As gold as the honey on Pooh's pot.		Aroma-Very good sweet hops.		Pallet- Thick and round. Very bitter and complex. Almost bights. A lot of hops.		Finish- Long and bitter. Some sweat candy like that creeps from the bottom.		Guzzle Factor Per Style- Can be a quencher cause you can drink a lot of it. But a lot of breweries Pil's drink easier. The pilsners in my opinion, is to serve the purpose of being a beer that it to be enjoyed at picnics and base ball games. This beer could do that in the right hands.		Texture- Round lager.		Extra: This is the second time I've reviewed this beer. I liked it better this time. I thought the complexity was very cool. Also the candy in the finish was very cool."
"Poured like a water, not a beer. I was expecting something much thicker, its not terrible, but pretty darn close. 		The smell was cordial cherries, a hint of chocolate, and dirty socks. It was that bad. The taste was slightly better, the cherry taste was more like metamucel than beer. 		The appearance was solid, but that's about it."
"16.9 oz bottle served in pint glass. 		A - clear golden color with a frothy white head that quickly disappears.		S - malty lager with high ABV		T -Mostly toasted malt but a bit of metaliic bitter taste too. 	High (9.5%) ABV is too obvious and alcohol detracts from flavor. 		M - light/medium body; low carbonation."
"Maybe it was morbid curiosity. Maybe it was interest in the style. Maybe I'm just a glutton for punishment. But whatever the reason, I did something I swore I never would do again. I bought something brewed by Trafalgar. So help me God.		The cap pries off way too easily with nary a hint of a whisper of pressure being released.		The pour is flat and murky dark brown with zero head and practically no carbonation.		Oh boy.		Aroma is mild roast.		The taste is roasty, grainy, watery, burnt and disgusting with a lingering bitterness in the finish. Tastes like a watery flat porter.		The mouthfeel is watery. There is no carbonation. Which renders this beer undrinkable.		Um. At least the label isn't completely terrible?"
"Appearance: Very light golden body with a copper hue. Thin head. Little or no retention.		Nose: Caramel malt. A faint sweetness, kind of like toffee candy. 		Taste: Malty with some light citrus. Lingering malty aftertaste. Somewhat bitter end. A little bland.		Drinkability: This is not a very good brew. Will probably not drink this again. Id take it over a Bud though."
750ml bottle. Here's hoping this one is better than the Peche... A vigorous pour yields a dark, hazed copper beer with virtually no head and no sign of carbonation. Certainly looks like an unblended lambic. Apple cider vinegar initially hits the nose. Some wet leather. Wet dog. A bit of butterscotch-y diacetyl. Then... acetone... and lots of it. Paint thinner all the way baby! Taking a deep whiff, it's actually kin of nostril stinging actually. Wow... this one smelled much better straight out of the fridge. The beer tastes like unflavored cough syrup. Aspirin. Nail polish remover. Oily apple cider vinegar... ugh. Not quite as bad as the Peche, but really close to being as awful. Greasy and oily on the tongue with a spicy, hot and damn near repulsive bile-like finish. Oh well... Thanks anyway Dan!
"Well I'm confused. When I bought the ""Extra Strong Stout"" I for some reason was expecting some in the vein of a Russian Imperial, but this would be...not that. It is not good, however, so that's something there.		Don't really know what to say. It looks sort of like pee, smells like alcohol and sweetness and grain, and tastes the same. Feel is okay. Haven't been too impressed with anything I've gotten from Eastern Europe so far (I'm talking about beer here people)."
"Smoked Porter. Why do I continue to try smoke beers? Oh well, here goes...		A - Pitch black with a thick foamy tan head. From a distance, this is one good looking beer.		S - Bacon, smoked meats, and a hint of whiskey. No hops, sweetness, or anything resembling a beer.		T - Smoked meats, cheap whiskey, and salty. Not a fan at all.		M - Rather thin, but still a silky smooth body.		D - Drainpour. I wish I could appreciate this style, but its just not for me."
"Okocim is another beer from the region with a ram / goat creature on its label. What is it with these people and goats? Apparently in the 1800's it's all the Polish marketing could come up with. Anyway, on with the beer, which I got from a Polish friend and he claims it's good. 		It looks pretty good from the pour and that's a start. A pleasing clear and deep golden colour with a head that, while diminishing, does provide some amount of lacing. Initially there isn't much smell.. but as you get deeper into the glass there's plenty of sweet malts to be had. Unfortunately it's not really interesting either.. and that sort of sums up the taste as well. Lots of sweet malts, a little bit of fruity yeast and an inadequate amount of hops to finish it off. 		This is not a well balanced beer and the longer it stays in your mouth the more you'll come to realize it. The sweetness grows far too quickly (or perhaps the hops dissipate even further if possible). Either way you're going to need some teeth brushing after this one.		Mouthfeel is on the watery side with a little bit too much tasteless carbonation on the tip of your tongue. My recommendation here is to pass. The ram on the label that's fondling the beer has clearly had too much to drink."
"A - Clear (despite the unfiltered claim) golden brew with a two finger head that quickly reduces to a haze and collar. I'm not really impressed, it looks like any macro lager.		S - Thin and weak nose that smells faintly of tangy wheat and mild citrus hops.		T - Weak hoppy taste with no sign of wheaty flavors at all. Tastes like a watered down pale ale. 		M - Thin, watery, and highly carbonated. 		D - A pretty weak and uninspired brew. I was expecting something approaching a hefeweizen, but this is more like a bland macro lager with an extra dose of hops. Not bad, but it's extremely boring."
Aiko pours a light orange color with a white head from a half liter brown bottle. The aroma is quite malty in a typical Eastern European way. Also quite malty in the flavor which is on the sweet end. There is a bit of fruitiness in the flavor. Alcohol is fairly well concealed. Not bad for what it is. Worth a try if you like Eastern European lagers.
"A- Pours a dark red color with a handful of pinkish colored bubbles. I knew I was in trouble right there. Pretty much no head retention or lacing. 		S- There it is a ton and I mean a ton of raspberries. Smells very sweet, yeast, and a light touch of bread. Don't get me wrong I like berries, especially when I run into one of the berry trees while I'm out hunting. I just don't really like them in my beer. 		T- I thought I was ready to get smashed on fruit here, but nope I wasn't ready by any means. HUGE amounts of raspberries, with a bit of booze to it and a touch of malts. Way too sweet.		M- Light in body and carbonation.		O- I'm not digging this one at all. Tastes more like a wine cooler than a beer, but to each their own."
"Purchased a bottle at Downtown Wine & Liquors in Somerville, MA.		A: Medium amber. Thin white head. Brilliant clarity.		S: Sweet malt flavor coupled with sweet dried fruit ester character. Smell is complex. Some diacetyl. Vinous. 		T: The taste is kind of a mess. Diacetyl flavors dominate and overshadow malty base and fruity ester compliments. Hop flavor is weak All of this is layered with a cloying medicinal/solvent taste. 		MF: Medium mouthfeel. Smooth. Low carbonation. No alcohol warming.		D: A poor taste and high alcohol assist in making this beer not very drinkable. I will not purchase this beer again. Hands down the worst of the Cooperstown Brewing Co. options."
"Chilled bottle into a glass. A generous gift from ramnuts. Thanks, Frank! 		Shared with alfrantzell and chswimmer. 		A: Pours a clear maroon body with a light tan head. The bubbles fill the tulip but quickly collapse into nothing. 		S: Not much aroma at all. Some nuts and orange, perhaps. 		T: This beer initially tasted like sushi. Ted narrowed it down to the seaweed wrap used in rolls, but I am convinced I picked up the soy / cardboard signs of oxidation, as well. As it warmed, those flavors receded a bit, producing flavors of orange, nuts, coffee, and some kind of spice. Somewhat disjointed. 		M: Oddly thin, with a watery flavor. 		D: Not enjoyable..."
"Notes from last night (8/10). 500ml bottle in to a pint glass last night.		A- Beer itself is dark, dark brown. Poured with a small off-white head.		S- Intense smoke. All I could think of was bottled Liquid Smoke. Some bacon fat notes as well.		T- Just a huge dose of intense woody smoke. Again I couldn't shake the association with the smell of Liquid Smoke. The smoke dies off pretty quickly, but it was so intense I didn't taste any of the other flavors that might be there. Bitter, and no sweetness at all. Finishes pretty clean.		M- Medium bodied.		D- I opened this on a day I grilled a beef tri-tip roast for optimal tasting conditions, but I still couldn't handle this beer. I only made it 3 or 4 sips in before moving on to something else. The smoke flavor was so strong that it overpowered anything else. The similarity to Liquid Smoke didn't help at all either. It was much smoother than I thought it would be so if I was really in the mood for a nice cold glass of smoke this would probably be what I would drink. Obviously this isn't a style I have learned to appreciate yet, but I do see how someone might enjoy this."
A new offering from Aruba's national brewery. The marketing seems geared towards a Corona-type vibe, and the taste corresponds. Color is a clear straw yellow with a clean white head. Slightly sweet aroma. Taste is very clean and light, a very bland corn flavor with the slightest bit of bitterness. Finishes very cleanly, since there was little flavor to start with. This beer is calling out for a lime wedge.
"Not a fan. But it's probably me, and not the beer. Beautiful dark brown, nearly black, pour with a nice medium bubble carbonation. Smell was smokey and pleasant. I was a bit startled at the level of smoke aroma and it was all I could detect. Taste was unbearably of cough medicine. I'm talking the stuff from the 60's that made no attempt to hide its medicinal qualities. I tried to pick out other flavors, but I just couldn't. A little thin on the palate. 		This is by far one of the most unique beers I've ever tried. I REALLY wanted to like it, but I couldn't. Again, ""It's not you, baby, It's me."""
A gimmick for a lager. The barrel ageing did impart a wine aroma, and some colour to the sight of it. Sourish acidic mouthfeel and on the thin mouthfeel side. Worth buying to encourage experimentation, and probably well consumed locally. crwills brought this one, so thanks craig!
"On tap at the brewery on 7/9.		A: Light pink color. A small fizzy head appeared and quickly faded to nothing. No lace.		A: not much going on here, some cherry aroma and that's about it. Not really impressed at all		T: tart cherry and some sweet malt. Not much hop presence. Really reminds me of a not so flavorful Chablis or something. 		M: light, again not much to it.		O: Really let down by this. Was hoping to get something along the lines of Belgian red, and got something that fell way short of that. Would not have again. Skal."
"1/4"" head, no retention, left no lacing. Dark brown/amber body. A nice murkiness like rusty water. I was rather disappointed by the aroma, as it was rather mild. It is a very smooth and a sweet sipper. Some hops, caramel, candy sugar and oak. Not much bourbon. Maybe I'm just missing it. I was way excited to try this and actually find it to be rather average."
Poured a very slightly hazy light gold color. Head was about half a finger thick and vanished almost immediately. Smell reminded me of a macro lager. Taste was also macro...only worse! I got an aftertaste that reminded me of licking an iron pipe, certainly some metallic tastes here. It just wasn't good. Nice thing was that the aftertaste did not linger whatsoever.
"This one forms a nice firm head, no lacing surprisingly and has a very lively body. It certainly looks a lot like a dark hef.		Sweet almost artificially sweetened smoke. The wheat elements are certainly showing. 		I expected something so different.my first taste of this was some head that was over powering and it had some good sweet creamy hef like qualities with smoke tones. The first sip of the actual beer is rather odd. Smoke is suble but very present. The malt has a sour like flavor that Ive gotten in some less enjoyable dark hefs but no cloves or bananas or strong sweet elements. Instead there is some kind of smoked meat (ham?) mixed with a sour malt. 		The body on this one is awful. It is just so thin so weak and the carbonation isnt that creamy hef carbonation or even a good pale ale, but instead it is sharp and bites the tongue. It has the kind of carbonation that makes you burp and I frankly cant think of a worse quality in a beer.		It seems this style is much like bourbon barrel ales. It isnt a style as much as a finishing element, but because of tradition it has a style. I like the smoke flavors, but some element of this process isnt working with the hef. I really think there is potential for these two to mesh, but either a touch less smoke or a touch more malt is needed to get things going in the right direction."
"Free bottle from work, bottled 4/23/10 haha! Poured into a pilsner glass.		A: Hazy orange amber with a pink hue. Minimal white head with lots of sticky lacing.		S: Musty malt aroma, some candy sweetness, and just old skunky aroma. Smells like fruity dust.		T: Super sweet and mildly tart cherry flavor mixing with funky skunky malt flavor.		M: Light bodied yet syrupy, with a decent amount of carbonation.		O: I had to pour this out. It was just horribly unenjoyable. Then again this bottle has been light-struck on a sales floor for 1.5 years. I would love to try a fresh example of this beer because I do thoroughly enjoy fruit beers, lambics, and sours."
"Sweet fruitiness numbs the palate.		Presentation: 750 ml brown capped bottle. Lazy label with Founders branding in soft faded scarlet hue with the name of the brew and a cut out of a raspberry and faint images of the fruit in the white background. Shows vintage 2001, and 9.2% Alc. by Vol. Poured into a snifter.		A - Deep crimson pour, short pinkish head with moderate to low retention, and little lacing.		S - Intense raspberry nose, heavy and sweet. Quite mono-chord, faint yeasty touch in the background.		T - Ouch, the nose was actually a shy advanced of the things to come Brutally sweet raspberry. Hefty sweetness destroying any nuances that this brew might be riding on. Imaginary yeasty touch in the distance, cloying sweetness screaming raspberry, and screaming annoyingly loud. 		M - Medium-full body specially after the intense sense of the brew, moderate if fair carbonation that does not entertain much the brew beyond its hammering identity.		O - Not a horrible brew but the overwhelming and mono-chord fruitiness seriously compromises the drinkability. Two or three ounces as a curious taste are actually more than enough.		Notes: Founder's brews some of my all time favorite brews, and then stuff like this It is not as bad as their Cerise but the experience with their fruit brews This one lacks the complex boozy punch of say DFH's Fort, or the tart nuances of a good lambic. Quite surprised by the hype generated by this brew, and that this one was selected as the first release in big bottles."
"Pours an attractive sunset-orange color with thick head. Head dissipates fairly quickly into a light ring of lacing along the sides.	Scent is odd; fruit such as plum and apricot with an overall musty aroma. Somewhat like fruit which is going rotten. Off-putting.	Flavor isn't any better. Begins with dried dark fruit and tangerine and kicks in with a yeast which tastes dry and dusty. Finishes hot, isopropyl-style alcohol and a sweet fruity aftertaste. Interesting, but not necessarily tasty, mixture.	Thin, hot and dry in the mouth.	Whew. This one attempts to be a Belgian strong ale with the fruitiness and high ABV, but they got the elements all wrong. I'd rather have a malt liquor.	Drain-pour."
"Another bomber from Trafalgar. I'm always a bit apprehensive about these brews, but what the heck maybe this one will be good...		Not a lot of head on this. Managed to get a half inch or so by pouring from about a foot above the glass. Looks like a bit of haze in a mostly clear copper liquid. Nose is fruity, some citrus, some roasted grain and cideriness.		Tastes soapy, buttery, watery, woody, oakey, astringent, very dry, slightly tart and there's slighty coarse bitterness in the aftertaste.		Overall, it's not too bad. There's really no wow factor at all and there are too many rough edges. Not impressed."
"Poured a pale yellow with a thin white bubbly head with little retention. 		Mild sour grain aromas. Not much here, and what there is isn't that enticing.		Thin light grain, some boiled corn and a bit of sugar fights its way through, but this is such a watery brew that anything good is lost in the dilution. No off notes, but nothing exciting either.		Fizzy and clean, it is a refreshing pizza beer. Won't overpower anything, but stand out on its own either. 		Sad, as some of the Amstel beers available in the Netherlands aren't bad -- but this watered down swill is just not worth having."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into nonic pint glass.		A - Murky, but not quite opaque, reddish brown. Two fingers of light tan head rise with moderate retention. A thin film remains with some moderate lacing.		S - Nice caramel aroma with some buttery notes. There's also an aroma of sour fruit with a touch of anise. 		T - Nothing too impressive here, way too dry for the style as far as I'm concerned. There's a slight brown sugar flavor early on with suggestions of butterscotch and toffee, but overall boring and attenuated. A huge dose of alcohol takes control mid palate and doesn't let up. Immediately there's an almost numbing, earthy bitterness that wipes away any trace of sweetness the beer had. Alcohol taste and bitterness prevail through the finish and long into the aftertaste.		M - Medium bodied with a soft carbonation. The alcohol makes this brew seem thinner.		D - Not a huge fan of this beer, and the bit alcohol flavor is a major deterrant. The bitterness is also on the crazy high side for the malt bomb that this should be. I doubt I'll bother getting this again in the near future. Plenty of better examples."
Bottle: Poured a golden color pilsner with a nice foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of corn and light floral malt is kind of disappointing. Taste is also dominated by some medium sweet corn malt with limited hops presence. Average body for the style with good carbonation. Another bland and boring euro-lager.
"This particular sample case has been contract brewed up in Utica with 400 other recipes. Costco usually just rebrands things(albeit, quality name brands) so I'm wondering if anyone can guess what this stuff is yet.		Best by June 28 2010		Poured into a Carlsberg Pilsener glass. Generic honey amber color. Just a bit milky, so I probably disturbed the sediment some. The yeast falls out pretty quickly though. Thin eggshell white head, but not much of it. There's too much wasted space up top, so I cap the glass off with 4-5 more ounces. :)		Smell is white bread, honey, subtle white pepper, & just a touch of citric acid. Shy, leafy hops. Boring & stale.		Taste has more going for it. Little bit of coriander, little bit of caraway, lots of starchy husks & hulls. Grainy. Grassy hops. No real pungent phenols like banana or clove that I'd associate with Hefes. No aftertaste besides a little glass.		Carbonation is almost right on, but is still a little thin & irritating like a force-carbed draught beer, & doesn't deliver that creamy feel I was expecting.		A bland American Hefeweizen without the hop bite. That is what this is. I drank two without flinching though, so it's not terrible. If CostCo can get stock it for a bit less(I think it was $21/cs), then maybe I'll give it another shot."
"Pours a brilliant, chestnut-amber in color, topped with a darker-tan head. Head exhibits good lacing and average duration.		Nose is very lightly hoppy up front, but there's more interesting things goin' on with the malts: sweetish and fruity, but also with notes of hazelnut and very light caramel and toffee.		On the first sip there's a sour, tangy, vegetal character that is almost completely off-putting*. Nut and toffee notes from the nose are here, but they are buried beneath the sour tangy, almost completely obscured. Sweetish, but not in a way that I was expecting. Lingering sweetness sort of saves the day, here, and although I'd been tempted to drain-pour, this one improved as it warmed.		Mouthfeel is average.		Not a great beer, but not altogether terrible, either, and worth a shot -- thankfully, this one was a stray single ; )		* No production or best-by code found on the can."
"What a creepy-looking label! Someone get that rotten lobster off that person.		Appearance: Pours a clear, golden body with a small, frothy white head.		Smell: Sweet-smelling pale malts with a faux floral waft of cleaning solution.		Taste: Strongly sweet malt flavor with an odd, industrial-strength astringency and some questionable flowery hints. Pair that with the hot alcohol taste and the whole thing becomes off-putting.		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.		Drinkability: The kind of beer that just begs to be drank straight from the bottle wrapped in a brown paper bag."
"Pours like a typical american macro, Golden to pale with a variety pack of carbonation bellow a fizz head.		The smell is where the euro lager comes through with its difference. A bit of a saaz or hop variety that has that earthy type kick to it. Sweet malt base. 		Its what you would expect from the style to be honest. Refreshing and fairly easy to pull down just nothing to crack any interest. Some will say its great sessioning this or good lawn mower type beer but there are much better offerings available that don't come from across the pond."
"Brewed with five hop additions, this alleged IPA has a slight cidery aroma, zero carbonation, and not a shred of head or lace. It is simple, clear amber.			Unfortunately, Harmon really dropped the ball on this fall seasonal. It is green tasting and oddly devoid of even the slightest hop aroma. The 68 IBUs of Glacier hops really dont shine, making this hard to reconcile as a single hop showcase beer. One Hop Wonder is not a completely disastrous ale, but the body is lifeless and the beer remains conceptually undeveloped. Nothing in the taste or aroma remotely resemble an IPA. It tastes like tired yeasts unable to pull their weight, and the finish is deathly. 			Not up to Harmon standards."
"Got talked into buying this last winter at a bottle shop I frequent in Richmond. Got it mainly for the stupid novelty of the label. Spent the summer in the beer fridge and just unearthed it during a recent excavation.		Hazy orange gold pour with 2-fingers of light beige foam. No retention. No lace. Bubbles clinging like crazy to the outside of the glass, though.		This is no doppelbock. This is straight alcohol. Light banana/clove nose, with extra emphasis on abv. A bit of earthy depth shows up, but mainly malt liquor.		Taste is all malt liquor too. Strong alcohol. light clove and a bready malt backbone define what is there. This beer is all about delivering a punch. Doesn't taste bad, but doesn't have much character either.		Feel is very thin for a doppel. Also very uninteresting.		Overall I bought it for the label for 3 bucks, got some laughs out of it for our holiday party, but wished I'd left the cap on the bottle."
"A - Beautiful orangy amber color. Only a little head but it sticks around for awhile.		S - not a super strong hoppy aroma that you get from powerful IPAs. A little citrusy too.		T - at first sip I got a strong bitter taste. So much so I was worried my glass had some residual soap in it but after trying a 2nd one in a different glass it tasted the same. Too strong of a citrus taste for my palate - almost like biting into a lemon.		O - I'm a certified hop head and love the Founders Breakfast Stout but this one disappointed me.		Maybe I got a bad batch b/c everyone seems to love this brew?"
"Thanks to schmoopsbeer for sending this can out my way. Served in a tulip.		Pour yields a transparent golden-hued brew with a good off-white head with some large bubbles of foam. Good staying power and a bit of lacing as it goes down. The nose is light and grassy with some citrusy hops coming through on the back-end. A bit of tangerine, as best as I can describe. The flavor profile is a bit grainy at first, followed by some grassy hops, and then there is a touch of bitterness in the finish. However, there is some grain tannin there as well. Not terribly pleasant. Light body with moderate carbonation. Can't get past the graininess of this. Not all too drinkable."
"got on tap at the Brewery with my meal.		Nice amber/copper/rust color with about a half inch head and a fine bit of lacing. Flavor of nice toasted grains, slightly malted with a nice little hop punch at the end. Made for a nicely balanced beer, though a litter lighter than I hadbeen initially expecting."
"A: brilliantly striking bold copper. almost red. a fine and dense head doesnt have the best retention. thing rim around the side. 		S: pineapple. that's legitimately the first time i've wrote that. melon. when i revisit it moves more towards a floral aroma. maybe a little bit of heat towards the finish.		T: hot, hot, hot. wow. this one needed some time. hop characteristics certainly make their way in there, citrus and a puckering bitterness. a little ganj.		M: very tingly on a very full body. 		D: i like the concept, actually love it, but this really needs some more time. maybe it got too close to room temperature to let the heat shine through too much? who knows, but it feels like im drinking a fine scotch rather than a beer. very mixed feelings right now."
Part of our shipment from Liquid Gratitude. Beer poured very foamy and was cloudy. A very slight hop aroma with some malt. Flavor was initially malty followed by some hop citrus flavors. Finished bitter. Low carbonation, flat mouthfeel. An OK beer, however I probably wouldn't buy it again.
"Beer pours a very nice golden color, a little lacing in the head, maybe a little watery though, doesn't stay around for long. Smell is yeasty and malty, reminds me of a halfway drinkable macro, maybe MGD. Taste follows suit, nothing that good about it, leaves that macro feeling in your mouth, bleh. 		I realize that a lot of breweries feel they need to make a beer like this to attract the BMC crowd, but for me, it turns me off from this brewery. I bought all of their regular brews and am hoping it gets much better from here."
Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Don't get any nose. Starts sort of sweet mild hops come through near finish, can't put a flavor on this one. Only bought it because it was a new country. $1.79 for a 330ml bottle from John's Market Tigard, Or.
"The beer is clear pale straw colored, a white quickly settling head, no lacing.		A faint smell of sour straw, corn and lemon.		Tasting of sweet corn flakes, some lemon and green apples.		Medium carbonation, a watery and fresh feeling, little body and a slightly dry finish.		A standard, slightly sweet euro lager, not really a german pilsner mesa thinks."
"A: Pale amber in color. Nice head, diminishes to a fluffy 5mm, and then a thin lace.		S:Very reminiscent of bananas. Odd, but pleasant.		T: A little odd, but I am not going to say I do not like it. The banana flavor stays in the nose. Once the beer warms up, a vinegary taste approaches.		MF: This beer lacks the body it should have.		D: I will finish this one, and probably not seek this one out again. I like the other Black Sheep offerings though.		It should also be noted that I bought this beer along with a Fullers 1875 that had a freshness date of 2005, so this beer may be old too. Take this review with a grain of salt, chips, and more beer."
"12oz bottle into SA perfect pint.		A: Pours a clear honey-amber with a fuzzy, lively, bright white head that quickly faded into a thin fizzy film. 	S: Salty soy sauce dominates with notes of wood, nuts, caramel malt and light spicy hops.	T: Honey, caramel malt, nuts, dry grains and tea. Tastes like a brown ale, along the same (bad) lines as Newcastle, but with a lot more honey sweetness. The soy sauce scent I smelled shows itself near the finish of the swallow, and the aftertaste is full of residual sweetness. Hard to pick out any hops. I only detect a slight peppery bitterness.	M: Carbonation is low, body is medium, and feel is very slick and syrupy. Finish is a tad watery. The sweet flavors in this beer get more synthetic and syrupy tasting as it warms.	D: Tried this one for the bottle. It tastes far too much like a bad brown ale for me to want to drink it again. Much too sweet and slick for my tastes."
"Black Sheep Riggwelter		G- INAO Tasting Glass		A- Bright, clear amber-brown. Heavy persistent lace.		S- Inviting aroma of malt. Hint of metallic minerals, stone.		T- Thin malty flavor with dominant hoppiness. Touch of apricot, peach. Bitterness too far forward of maltiness. Thin, empty, watery finish. Fails to entice.		M- Insufficient viscosity/gravity to hold interest for long. Thin on substance.		Serving- 12oz bottle."
"This is a relatively flavorful malt liquor beer, easy drinking, and respectable.  St. Ides pours a peachy-amber-gold with a white head, of a good inch, with some retention.  The nose is stale metal, sweet malt/corn, and fairly strong apples.  The taste is sweet, applely, with some malt undertones.  It is decent tasting and the mouthfeel is fulfilling.  The high alcohol content is not noticeable.  Again, this beer is not BA worthy but it is a good malt liquor beer.  This is a getting drunk beer.  If that is what you are looking for then have at it.  		I have no need to drink it again."
"The good news is that you can get beers from what i assume is a small brewery at somewhere like Northmead, in their extensive Euro range. Not expensive, either. Several medals on the label!!!!		The rest of the news isn't quite such a cause for 'Celebration'		Pours ok, one finger head that recedes quickly, looks darker than a Euro lager.		After that, sadly, it neither has the fresh taste nor does it refesh like a Euro, or more accurately of course, Czech lager should.		Earthy, dull flavours predominate, some bitterness but not a lot, and it is light and watery in the mouth. Would be OK in summer, but hell, there are so many better.		The bottle had six months left on the bb date, as well.		Move along folks, nothing to Celebrate here, sadly."
"I choose to interpret this beer's award of a medal at the 1996 GABF as a sign of the improving quality of American brewing, and not as a sign of meaninglessness for these awards. In short, I didn't find this beer to be all that commendable.		Aroma was a sort of brass colored tan with minimal head. Aroma was virtually non-existent. Flavor was thin, and the predominant characteristic was an ash-tray like flavor. Mouthfeel was thin.		I wouldn't recommend this, and in fact I resent the Microbrew of the Month people a bit for sending it to me."
"I was rather disappointed with this beer.		Pours a dark brown red that obscures most light. The head is a nice light brown that fades quickly to nothing. No lacing.		Smell is light raisin and prune with some light clove and vinegar. Not very pleasant.		Taste is a lambic like sour bite with a raisiny aftertaste.		Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated with a tannin-like drying effect.		I'm drinking the whole bottle, but won't buy again."
"12oz bottle served in Stella tulip.		A: Deep amber with some ruby red highlights. Off white head is small even after an aggressive pour and doesn't last very long.		S: Exactly like a cherry cordial. Low grade chocolate, maraschino cherry, and sugary liquid filling. It doesn't smell like beer, but its spot on for a chocolate covered cherry.		T: Mirrors smell. No real genuine malt flavor and certainly no hop presence worth mentioning. Vague chocolatey flavor and cherry liqueur. Mostly sweet, but not quite cloying. No real beer flavor.		M: Sharp carbonation. Thin feel.		D: Not very high. I expected the flavors to be too much, but I could actually have more than one of these in a sitting.		This is not a good beer, but I think it accomplishes its mission. The label says Cherry Chocolate Beer, and aside from the beer part that's what it is. I've given a pretty low rating, but I might grab a single of this here and there because sometimes being a beer nerd gets old and I need to cheat a little. Worth a shot if you're looking for a new guilty pleasure."
"Maybe, one pint bottle or something? Poured into a pint glass. Not sure how long I've had this in the fridge, but probably a long time.		Pours clear yellow with almost no head. Smell is a spicy lager smell that, for some reason, made me think of fruit loops. Smells a little lemony. Taste is sweet, not terribly exciting, somewhat lemony, at first impression it's not as bad as I was expecting (but also definitely not very good). However, the aftertaste evens out into something rather bad. Gym socks and lemon tea, maybe.		Mouthfeel is flat, thick and sticky. Overall, I think I'm not finishing this beer."
"A - Poured a copper color with a thin off white head with no lacing		S - Is of grainy malt some honey and oxidation 		T - The oxidation is killing this beer not really sure it was a good one to begin with but it tastes like wet cardboard and grainy malt		M - This beer has a light body with medium carbonation to it		D - This just isn't a very good tasting beer that is taking some effort to drink therefore its not something that I would seek out"
"Chilled 12oz bottle into a glass. An extra courtesy of drgonzo3705. Thanks Paul!		A: Pours a pitch black that rubies (yes, dammit, that's a verb!) out at the edge. An inch of tan-colored head recedes over a few minutes into a thin line on top of the brew that never quite goes away. Moderate washes of lacing down the glass during a swig, but nothing that sticks. 		S: Coffee is strongest, followed by dark chocolate and a lighter bourbon nose. Some roasted barley malt and caramel. 		T: Again, mostly coffee and dark chocolate. Roasted malt and caramel provide some sweetness, and there's only the slightest hint of bourbon (why?). I expected more bourbon-dominated flavor given the name... 		M: On the thin side, actually. Carbonation is low and works pretty well to bring out the flavor. Well-masked ABV. Not boozy in the slightest. 		D: It's all right. I'd probably skip it if I saw it."
"Thanks to pimpmyporter for this beer. 		Bomber split into two pint glasses. Poured into my glass the beer is cloudy golden orange amber. Two fingers of vanilla hued head recede leaving thick gobs of lace. 		The aroma is a huge boquet of citrus fruits and pure pine sap. Like a fresh cut grapfruit smeared with pine tree sap. There is a hint of sweetness mixed in but just a hint.		The flavor is just flat out in your face bitter. There's a such thing as over the top in my book and this is it. Loads of pine and citrus give way to more hops and more bitterness. No balanced at all. The only other element I can detect is the booze.		Medium body with moderate carbonation. 		Overall a bit of a gimick beer if you ask me. One dementional and flat out hard to drink."
"A beer made by werewolves! How could I pass this up?!		Pours a rich amber color, like the werewolf who made it accidentally spilled some blood into it. I really hope that's not the case. Very cloudy, lots of sediment. Hope that's not fur. Damn werewolves. The pinkish-white head is short lived, no lacing and no cling.		Smells very sweet, bready malts and carmel. Really appealing on the wiffer.		Sugar sweet and biscuit taste. Not a bad belgium flavor. The alcohol seems to come through in the end, not really a pleasant finish but otherwise tastey.		The impact on the palate though... Damn. Hot alcohol taste, virtually no carbonation. Someone should talk to these werewolves, they need to spend less time hunting people down and devouring them and more time paying attention to what they're brewing. If I lived in the area I'd take care of it myself, threaten the bastards with some silver bullets or some shit; that's the kind of thing they respond to.		With the high alcohol content and flat taste, I don't see this being much for a session. I might drink this again if I were strapped for cash (only $2 for the 1.09 pint bottle) but otherwise I'd steer clear of it."
The color of the sand at a New England beach. Had a small head for about 5 seconds, no lace. Smell is a sandy hop leaf - just one and it is kind of a shriveled runt. Flavor is like a salty desert. Damn, I can't get the whole sand and desert idea out of my head with this beer. It is just so dry it is shocking and I am surprised light beer drinkers can deal with such bitterness. Thin body with some zip and sizzle that smooths out at it sits. Sort of refreshing in its dryness. Pretty clean, better made than most light beers yet still far from desirable. Did I mention that this is dry?
"Poured from 12oz bottle into Pint glass.		A: The light amber color of this beer is what you would expect from a Pale Ale, but the head was disappointing. Only about a 1/3 finger width was obtained and that had quickly disappeared to nothing at all within a minute. As much lacing as a glass of water.		S: Very yeasty, almost off putting on the nose. No other hints of anything can fight their way past the yeast, assuming there is anything else in there.		T: This was an English Ale that tasted like it didn't know what it wanted to be when it grew up. There were some notes of hops, but the overall effect was to create a badly flavored, slightly bitter, wash-out of the English Pale Ale style. I honestly wonder if when confronted with flavor, the brewers had beaten a hasty withdrawal yelling ""Run away, run away"" and that is where the name came from. Truly unremarkable in anyway.		M: Light and about as complex as a glass of club soda. The only thing noticeable was a faint hint that it had once been carbonated, but the bubbles decided they were better off somewhere in Kent.		D: I have never drain poured a beer as I always try to find something redeeming. I know just because I don't particularly care for something doesn't mean it is bad. But this was close. Honestly, if someone handed me one I would drink it, but if they asked before hand if I wanted them to get me one, I would turn it down. There is nothing overly wrong with this beer, but it is a constant disappointment at every turn. Honestly, I would save the $$$ for something else."
"Appearance: poured with a wonderfully massive, foamy three-finger head. As a drink it, I'm notcing some nice cling...which is pleasant to the eye and almost mandatory for an IPA. The beer is a burnt orange/copper. Looking closer, you may notice that this is a damn murkey beer. I'm gonna say this is bottle conditioned.		Smell: Piney hops! smells a bit boozey as well....also I get some orange/pear/peach smell		Taste: Malty for certain, especially for an IPA. This was a bit of a suprise. The taste estery, and smacks distinctly of pears and some orange rind....I gotta say that while I do get a ""sweet"" fruity taste...it's also a tad tart. After this, is piney hop bitterness mixed with raw heavy alcohol. The raw aftertaste does not mesh well with sweet/tart...but I'm partial to double IPA's so my score won't be too low		Mouthfeel: Slick		Drinkability: Eh, it's 10% alcohol with contradictory flavors."
"Best By 6/27/10. I'm a little worried going in as there was no hiss of carbonation escaping as I open the bottle.		A-Pours a dark brown with no head. I'm not sure what the deal is with the carbonation, but there doesn't appear to be any. 		S-Smells of sweet toffee malt and caramel with some earthiness.		T-Caramel sweetness with a breadiness and a barely bitter finish.		M-Kind of terrible as there's no carbonation whatsoever. Thin side of medium bodied. 		D-I was pretty excited as this was my first beer from Stoudts. I really like ESB's and was expecting good things, but the complete lack of carbonation is killing this beer for me. I'm hoping the other bottle I got of Stoudts is more impressive."
"Stocked up on beers I can't get in Maine, and realized that sometimes I do forget how a beer tasted after awhile. so I'm doing a lot more reviews for my own benefit.		Pours a foamy head with great lacing. Doesn't foam up too much as to require two pours, which is a plus.		Smells boozy with dark caramelized and maybe eveb German malts. Going into this blind I might have guessed it was a Doppelbock.		Taste: No, definitely not a doppelbock. That was dumb.		Sweet, but not sweet enough to hide the alcohol. That's fine- sometimes I like when a beer is honest with me. This is probably the booziest, harshest Scottish ale I've ever had. That's not a bad thing, but it means this is a sipper if there ever was one.		Medium bodied despite all the sweetness. I bet I could drink 2 of these in a row."
No head, slightly cloudy amber. Nose has citrus, pine, a hint of diacetyl and maybe banana(?). Very bitter and mouthcoating. Grassy taste and not much else. I generally like DIPA/IIPAs and there's nothing I'm enjoying about this. Drain pour. Wondering if this was a flawed bottle.
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Best before date March 2008. Purchased at BBC S. 4th St, Louisville.		Pours a dark brown coffee color, small tan head recedes to a ring, some tiny wisps of lace left.		Aroma is pleasant, chocolate and roasted notes. One the palate, all roasted bitterness, cocoa, both hop and char bitterness in the finish. A bit too much bitterness without a lot of complexity...certainly a decent beer but does not thrill. Likely better on tap, worth another try when at a BBC brewpub."
"Pale yellow, slightly veiled. Average white head. It has a color more from a washed pils.	At the taste a lot of wheat, grainy, few spices. Some orange peel.	In the taste too, beside the wheat and a light hint of spicy, it doesn't taste really like a blanche.	Quite fruity (tropical fruit and orange), and a lot of wheat.	Really light body.	Wheat, fruitiness and some orange peel in the aftertaste."
"Crikey! I finally did it I found a new beer to the web site.		The bottle states the beer is 6% alcohol by volume. This is a traditional German style unfilterd wheat beer with a lively flavor. Although no fruit or spices were used in the brewing... Wild Frog Wheat can be served with a slice of lemon or orange for a crisp, refreshing experience.		The beer was served chilled in an Imperial Pint glass. No fruit garnished my glass. Perhaps at another time I will fruit the glass but not today.		Appearance: The beer pours a hazy cloudy orange yellow coloration. The head is a biege coloration approximately 2 fingers high. The head quickly resolves itself into a ring of foam. Streaks and whisp of lacing remain behind on my glass.		Smell: The beer has a passable lemon citrus and banana clove bread aroma.		Taste: The beer has a dominate lemony citrus taste intially. Then the beers flavor goes off into an astringent wicker basket sort of flavor. 		Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a slightly bigger than light body. I think this would improve with a bit more carbonation. Frankly the astringency of the finish messed this beer up for me. I have a second bottle on hand. I will try the second bottle in a few days and update the review if necessary. I was looking forward to this beer and now to say the least I am a bit disappointed and unsatisfied."
"Old Ales brewed in America tend to be little more than Barleywines; alternatively, British Old Ales taste more like sherry than they do beer.		This offering is a hybrid of the two styles, and it is most unusual. There is a noticable hop presence, not overpowering, but unmistakably there coupled with strong nutty, oxidized notes.		The end result is actually vaguely whisky-like.		It tastes like somebody mixed Bigfoot Barleywine with Sandeman Oloeroso, in about a 50/50 split.		A bridge between the two beer worlds of America and Britain. Leave it to Founders to find a unique twist on an old style.		Interesting though it may be, I'm not sure I could see myself buying this again."
"I tried this beers Urbock cousin last year, and thought it was the worst crap I have ever had. However, I drank it without food on a cool afternoon, so I decided to try again.		This time, I had the Marzen with grilled brats on a hot summers eve, complete with spicy mustard and kraut. If Im ever going to like it, nows the time, I figured.		Unfortunately, the intense smoky aspect totally dominated the aroma, flavor and finish, to the point where I was alternating bites of Brat with sips of beer, just to get it down.		I have somewhat enjoyed beers with a smoky tint (Great Lakes Engine 20 comes to mind), but the smoke is much too dominant in this Aecht Schlenkerla line for me.		 I REALLY tried on this one, but it can best be summed up like this:		Set a pile of old clothes on fire, extinguish it with a bucket of water and drink the runoff."
Bottle: Poured a deep clear brown color ale with an average foamy head with some average retention and no lacing. Aroma of grainy malt with no discernable hops and some dry malt notes. Taste is also dominated by some unrefined grain notes with a somewhat dry finish. Body is a bit thin but with some average carbonation. Not as bad as some other beers form this brewery but too plain and boring for my taste buds.
"This beers can has a slogan ""pure yorkshire"" but the fact that COORS had something to do with it. made me rather suspiscious (although unfortunately I only looked at the fine print after i'd bought it). Tastewise it is an ale that aims high but achieves low due to the probable cheapness of its ingredients. It has a metallic taste to me although another flatmate described as having a barley sugar taste. Its kind of a half-arsed beer really it tastes like there is something quite good hidden under the crappy tastes although I suspect that in reality i've got that sentence the wrong way around. The dodgy taste overwhelms this attempt at an english ale..."
"Purchased a bottle at Julio's Liquors located in Westborough, MA.		A: Amber hue. No head. Good clarity. This beer has legs.		S: Dark fruits and fusel alcohols dominate. Very sweet. Somewhat one dimensional. 		T: Ridiculously sweet taste, which gets in the way of the other flavor characteristics. Dried fruits and alcohol. Not very good. 		MF: Cloyingly thick due to sweetness. Low carbonation. 		D, notes: Far too sweet to be drinkable. Not impressive in the least."
Nice, really dark red color for a Pale. Little to no head, some moderate off-white lacing. I don't know if it was just the bottle I happened to get, but the scent and taste of this one was really flat. I don't mean that the beer itself was flat, the carbonation and all seemed fine, but the taste was just not there that night. There were some obvious citric notes in the scent, but nothing too specific. The flavor and mouthfeel were horribly off balance, all bitterness with nothing to smooth it out. The bitterness just overwhelmed any flavor that made an attempt to get to the palate. I don't mind bitter beers, some of my favorites are IPAs and Double IPAs, but this was just way off for the style and it didn't offer much to make it a worthwile experience otherwise. I'd try it once more (at the brewpub next time) just because I think it's not impossible that there was something wrong with the bottle I had, although I have no reason other than the flavor to think so, but if it came out this way again it'd be my last Pike's Pale.
There really isn't much difference beyween Okocim Lager & Okocim Mocne. This is a very flat looking lager with little head. Reminds me of apple juice. The mouthfeel is smooth/flat and lacks body. The taste is bland....light malt, not really any hoppiness. Some alcohol aftertaste. A boring beer experience.
Pours deep opaque brown with a dense off white head. The aroma is malty and the flavor is more porterlike than anything. Roasted, chicory, unsubtle. There is a flatness on the finish. The label promises coriander, but I don't see it. The mouthfeel is prickly.
"Pours a copper color with a huge head with nice retention. 		The aroma was a bit of a disappointment. Very light aromas of caramel and bread make an appearance, nothing special.		Much like the aroma the flavor is lacking. The bread and caramel flavors from the aroma make another appearance in the flavor. There's not a whole lot to this brew, almost tastes like a botched homebrew.		I expected more from this brew, guess I got suckered by the pretty lable."
"Source/Serving: 500mL bottle with expiry date of 2/16/2011		Smell: Old sponge, musty apple, wet towels, slight nondescript hops.		Taste: Creamy artificial caramel and apple at first. Vapid bitterness, very thin watery mouthfeel, but plenty of bubbles. In no way harsh, rather its oddly creamy. Devoid of much flavor in the middle... just a touch of dry bitterness with continued caramel and a mineral edge. Finish is dry, soapy and very metallic. Quite watery and coats the tongue unpleasantly making you need another sip.		Note: A real disappointment."
Not to be be confused with the unremarkable Wisconsin-based beer of the same 'Horse Piss' name, BBC's entry pours a faint urine yellow - appropriately enough, with almost no nose. Smells like a mainstream beer, and tastes very plain and watery. This is a lager without much personality. But at least there's no pretense here - what you get is exactly what you'd expect from the name. Methinks the consistently top-notch BBC Brewery is pulling one over with this novelty brew.
"Appropriate for dancing with the devil, its color's on the darker side of IPAs--a light brown, yet translucent. Oddly, the carefree pour provides basically no head. A thin line of fizz circles only the edge of the cap. Lacing is evident.		Like the look, there's nothing remarkable about the smell. It actually lacks the hop wave characteristic of hop bombs. Instead, you definitely sense a malty balance. It neither looks nor smells overly malty, but both provide proof that it's more than a hop monster. A hint of charred wood, like roasted, malty oak lingers on the nose. 		It tastes good, but it's like I taste more ethanol than hop. Instead of a IIIPA, it tastes more like a light but strong amber. Again, I sense the wood--this time with alcohol on it. It's a big Michigan beer, but it's not as tasty as its West Coast counterparts. It's a different beer, obviously, but I miss pine and grapefruit...I miss more hop appeal. In the inevitable intra-state argument, this is no Hopslam. Perhaps that's an unfair comparison, but to what else should I compare a Michigan Triple IPA? I realize Founders can't copy the honey recipe, but the amber-like barley malts don't as effectively balance the hops. I like it, but IIIPAs aren't supposed to taste so plain (but strong). In attempts to consider the style while rating, I guess it is the average Triple IPA.		I want to give the beer a good score, and mouthfeel is the best realm in which to do it. It tastes plain enough to swallow down, but the alcohol makes me hang onto it for a minute. The ethanol gives my cheeks a raisin-like tingle, like a hop- or barleywine...even like a merlot. It's like the beer's got complexities that merge into a simply strong amber. It's nothing like I expected, but the malty mouthfeel complements the big alcohol nicely. 		Drinkability is a relative weakness. It's strong, yet (seemingly) so plain, and those characteristics do not a Bud Light commercial make. It's drinkable like an amber, and that's not really good. Even among hopster counterparts, this wouldn't be your go-to choice. I'd prefer 3 Hopslams over a Devil Dancer...2 Hop Stoopids. 		I'm coming to the conclusion that Founders rules the darker stouts (read: KBS and double chocolate oatmeal), whereas Bells brings hop reign (read: Hopslam and Two-hearted). I'm okay with that...and proud of Michigan."
"I had this one at 1492 which is a very good tapas restaurant located in downtown Chicago. I figured Spanish beer & Spanish food should go well together. 		Beer poured a nice bright gold with a decent head . Some lacing. 		Beer smelled of malt and grain with a slightly musty odor as well.		Taste was similar to the smell. Lots of husky grain & some subdued malt. Just slight pinpricks of hops. The musty odor was also in the taste, perhaps this was an old sample, but I dont think so.		Mouthfeel was fine, drinkablity was hindered by the lackluster taste. Three other people with me ordered this beer, not one ordered a 2nd."
Picked up a single bottle of this at Liquor Barn in Louisville. Pours a medium amber color with a very light tan head. A bit of lacing on the glass. It smells nice. Seemed to smell a bit more hops than the usual Oktoberfest. Mouthfeel is very thin and watery to me, with mid/low carbonation. The taste is a bit more bitter than the usual Oktoberfest, like the smell, with a lingering bitter aftertaste. The bitterness does calm down some as the beer warms up Overall, I was not very impressed with this beer. BBC puts out better stuff than this.
"Labeled as Doppel-Doppel Bock, therefore the World's first Quadruple Bock from this Czech brewer. On the back label there is a a German designation ""helles"" = ""pale"" added to the beer's denomination. 500 ml, BB date reads 10. June 2011.	Pour into tulip results in deep golden to coppery/amber body a with good clarity provided by lagering, topped by short, frothy off-white head that slowly recedes to a stable cloth. Aroma is strong malt with some melanoidins and toasty notes, caramel sweetness, plum & grape-like fruitiness from the malts used and evident alcohol. The flavor is strong malt with a rich caramel sweetness, warming, slightly burning alcohol and toward the finish prominent hoppy bitterness with a spicy touch probably originating from noble hops. Tends to coat the lips with a sweet film and although on the sweet side still gives an impression of attenuation. The body is medium-full with moderate carbonation.		In short: A sweet-bitter and alcoholic Doppelbock."
"Poured from a bottle into a Tulip.		A - Beer pours a transparent orangish color with and eggshell head a a good bit of lacing.		S - Hoppy. Citris is the main suspect here. Despite what a few others have said, I'm not getting any pine. It also smells very sweet at the same time. Interesting on the nose, this beer.		T - The citris hops flood the mouth initially with a fair amount of vigor. Soon after, the sweetness on the nose comes across, but no in a way that I like a lot. It seems a bit cloying.		M - Full bodied with a nice amount of carbonation.		D - High abv and cloying sweetness hurt this one a bit."
"I have never tried a beer that I couldn't finish. My brother is the same. Well, yesterday we tried Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen and neither of us could drink it. 		What an experience! I must admit I am not a big fan of smoked food and I realize that this beer is probably an acquired taste but I will give Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen credit for initiating a lesson in recognizing excessive hubris on my part. I generally pride myself in my ability to eat or drink things that would make a billygoat sick but this stuff slapped me hard and put me in my place. 		We did, however, put the beer to good use as a marinade for our barbecued chicken. Now that I can handle."
A beer for getting drunk with. It poured with a bright straw coloered hue, Its head was active, clinging well to the glass till 1/2 way through the review. It aroma was very malty, and burnt, which both carried over into the taste. A beer I don't think I would like to experience again.
"200ml bottle: One time brew..this is an ESB ale with natural cherry fruit added.		Poured a clear burnished copper color with ruby highlights into my goblet....small cap does not last or lace. Softly carbonated.		Aromas of musty grains and sour fruit and a light sweetness.		Fair malt presense, nedium-light body, soapy mouth feel.		You get to chew on some decent rye bread tastes in the front then the sour cherry and goldings combine to balance with a fruity bittering. This bittering continues into the wet finish which is abrupt but clean with a slight metallic-sour aftertaste.		An interesting use of fruit here...the cherries are picked for their sourness which seems to compliment the goldings.	Not a bad ESB but I would like to see more malt body and then there is that signature rotting yeast taste ."
"Another one that I Picked up from the brewery, Thought I'd give it a try.		This interestingly did not pour a ""red"" as it was supposed to but more a dark brown with no head to speak of. Smell was of strong malt, a sweetness existed there too. This is carried into the flavor as well, sweet but tolerable malt character with almost no hops. This I found tasted very flat and not terribly appetizing, With some carbonation this wouldn't have been that bad, however the way it is, not that good.		I thought I just got a bad bottle, But it doesn't seem anyone else's opinion of this brew is much different from my own. Unforunate, really."
"12oz bottle into my Darkness glass...Pours a super dark copper with no carbonation at all...A light grassy aroma with a hint of hops and alcohol on the finish. An unappealing aroma but not strong enough to detract...The taste is really harsh and bitter, metal, hop bombish hops bitter. 		This is a hop head dream in a pale ale. Not the proper taste profiles, skip this."
"Appearance: light amber		Smell: not much of anything really...some prickly sweet husky is kinda detectable		Taste: grains, sweet malt, plum, sour hops...it just doesnt add up to something good		Mouhtfeel: syrupy and flat		Drinkablility: sigh....not that drinkable when you factor in below average taste and high alcohol"
"From bottle to oversized wine glass. Bottled 5/17/10, consumed within 3 weeks. Dry-hopped for twenty-six days straight with a combination of 10 hop varieties. Even Mr. Calagione would be impressed with that.		A: Scant one finger of creamy/foamy light khaki colored head with above average retention. Reduces to a creamy collar and a thin film remains. The body is dark by DIPA standards (although of course, the Devil Dancer is the fabled TRIPLE IPA). Caramel colored with orange and red highlights. Transparency is low, except when held in front of light, where the clarity improves dramatically. Even still, a bit hazy. A few small smatterings of lace end up on the glass.		S & T: Heavy malts of caramel, bread and grains, all toasted. Huge pine backed by resin aromas dominate the hop bill. Interestingly, these are the only evident aromas and flavors despite the 10 different varieties used in dry hopping. The 112 IBU's are completely evident (even on the nose) as this will undoubtebly be a bitterbomb. Way too much alcohol comes through on the nose and palate.		M: Very much like an effervescent digestif. Slightly syrupy with mouth coating cloyingness. Minimally sticky with soft carbonation. The finish is heavily bitter which rounds itself out as the beer comes to room temperature. Slick texture.		D: Not very drinkable, definitely demanding small sips. Drinkability is low; SIPability however is high. Serve this one at 60 degrees or higher. I bet Devil Dancer ages nicely into a barleywine. If this is the case, I understand now why my bottleshop offers older vintages.		Having had this on draft first, I imagine my overall rating would be closer to 4.5. This brew performs considerably better in all categories on draft. It is actually a completely different experience."
"A: Pours a clear yellow with a fizzy white head that leaves little in the way of lacing.		S: Like most light lagers, there really isn't much of a scent to this beer. All I can detect is a little bit of straw, with some grassy hop and biscuit aromas behind it.		T: Fleeting notes of grass, lemon, straw, biscuits, minerals, and honey disappear after a couple of seconds in the mouth. The finish is virtually nonexistent, with only the faintest traces of grass and mineral flavors lingering in the mouth after the beer has been swallowed.		M: Very light-bodied, crisp, and dry.		O: This is a pretty standard light lager. Fortunately, it's better than Coors Light and Bud Light, but that's still not saying much."
"A - Nearly crystal clear golden amber. About a half-inch white head that lingers quite a while, leaving a fair amount of lace in its wake.		S - Citrusy and grassy. There is almost no malt to speak of in the nose, just hops. 		T - Pure hops. Grass and citrus with very little malt to speak of considering the amount of hop bitterness. The bitterness of the hops encompasses the entirety of the finish.		M - Medium bodied, nothing really worthy of note.		D - A little below average for the style. I would expect a bit more character from the malts to even out the hops a bit."
"Sounded interesting enough...	Appears a hazy red with a lush, off-white head that retains well. Scattered lacing is left all around the glass.	Smell is of an old batch of Dr. Pepper that was poured into a thermos back in 1985 and forgotten about until now. Slightly odd aromas of brown sugar, clove, cinnamon, along with a whiff of cherry cola.	Taste is of the same aromas with a weird spicy, cloyingly sweet mix that really does remind me of Dr. Pepper that has fermented from bacteria and gone awry.	The mouthfeel is spicy, sweet, and different. An odd mix that isn't awful but certainly not to my liking.	Drinkability...you be judge. I guess it's somewhere in the middle if you're in the mood for this kind of stuff."
I had the can version, which probably didn't help much. I found this to be pretty weak and watery. Unattractive gold color with a thick white head. No real lacing to speak of. Slight hops in the aroma but that was about it. Very dry finish and really lacking in the flavor department. I hope the Mocne is better...
"Light gold body. Nice fluffy white head. Good retention. 		This beer had a weird wet hay smell. Reminded me of a horse stable. Not good.		Taste was average for a pale ale. Solid hop profile with a medium malt background. Clean and distinct on the palate. Finishes with some citrus notes.		A below average APA. I will not look out for this beer in the future. I would drink it again only if it were the last beer in my fridge."
"Missed out on this one last year so I grabbed one before it disappears this year. 12oz bottle into a Founders pint glass.		Pours a reddish golden color with a healthy couple fingers of white head that quickly dissipates to a thin layer on top.		Aroma is of malt and cherries. The cherries don't come through in the aroma as much as I had expected.		The cherries that were hiding in the aroma take over and steal the show when this one hits my tongue. The cherries deliver some serious tartness that borders on being sour. Finishes with a mild bitterness that seems a bit out of place.		Mouthfeel is thicker than expected and pretty slick but features some nice prickly carbonation on the tongue. I could probably drink another, but I'm glad I was able to buy a single and don't have to worry about consuming a whole four pack."
"Rich honey with the slightest suggestion of orange when backlit. The two finger cap is a few shades darker than bright white, while staying well away from dingy white. It's reasonably long-lived (given the ABV), but doesn't stick to the glass well at all. 		The nose is reminiscent of cheap vodka-soaked grain with a modest amount of stale noble hoppiness. There isn't as much ethanol as there could be, so that's something. While I'm not offended, I'm not impressed in the slightest.		Zaibo is a different soft of Euro strong lager than its 8.0% brother (Birzieciu). It isn't nearly as good from where I sit. This beer is more typical of the style, with its American malt liquor-like pale maltiness and its up-front booziness. Musky hops are as apparent on the palate as they are in the nose. They're still overwhelmed by sweet grain and ethanol, Zaibo's twin towers of terror.		The mouthfeel is full, slick and borderline syrupy. There's quite a bit of carbonation, but it's so fine-bubbled that it doesn't lighten things much at all. Actually, I can't think of any mouthfeel change that would improve this experience. The flavor profile just doesn't have enough going for it.		The brewery's website says that Zaibo 'is often used as a synonym for a strong beer'. That little fact is the most interesting thing about this lager. I can't imagine that anyone (outside of Eastern Europe) loves beer of this style. On the off chance that there are a few, I can think of a handful that are vastly superior to Zaibo. Not recommended under any circumstances."
"First off, just let me start off by saying that I cannot believe--CANNOT BELIEVE--that this beer has thusfar obtained a C+ rating on this site. It almost makes me lose faith in the system completely. It makes me wonder if those people giving this beer B's were somehow tricked by it's absurd alcoholic content.		I picked up this beer for exactly $1 at the local liquor depot. A buck. A dollar for a 9.5% abv. beer. That does not bode well in any language.		Appearance: A frothy golden color that surprisingly doesn't clear. The color of cloudy urine in the toliet bowl.		Smell: Indescribable. My friend compared it to the smell of toe fungus.		Taste: I wouldn't know, but presumably also close to the taste of toe fungus. Upon drinking an american lager later in the evening, it occured to me that if you magnified the funky taste of say, an MGD about a dozen times, this is probably what it would taste like.		Mouthfeel: It invaded my mouth like a Lithuainian army. The aftertaste was even worse than the present-taste.		Drinkability: Drain-pour."
"10/27/07) This was once one of the better brews from this brewpub, but now, it's just awful, an incompetent beer on any level, homebrew or especially, an brewpub amber/red ale. Everything is so off in taste to the extent that I wondering if the lines and keg barrels have become infected. O'Griff's house brews have gotten so bad that I imagine the brewery will close soon. The owners either need to get a new brewmaster, or just stop brewing period if they are unwilling to take any pride in their house brews.		(Original review 04/30/06, A/3.5 S/4 T/4 M/4 D/4 3.9 overall) I had this from the tap many times, but I am reviewing from a growler within 24 hours of purchase. From a half gallon clear glass growler with O'Griff's logo on the front and address and phone number on the back. Made a decent appearance, poured a chill hazy, reddish amber with a pale tannish white foamy head that settled into a thin lacing, medium carbonation. Had tea-like and herbal hop nose with a toasted grainy malt background. A crisp, smooth light-ish medium bodied mouth feel, good drinkability. Very tasty, fresh brew tea, toasted graininess, a mild rolling on the tongue hop bitterness, a nice alcohol warmth in the palate, and a dry, sweet tea, toasted grainy finish.	One of the better brews at O'Griff's, tasty and balanced, this is one that is well worth trying."
"A big, white, meringue head develops quickly, leaving nice lace as it works its way down the pilsner glass over a crystal-clear, pale yellow water.		A skunk walked by, followed by a dirty skunk dragging wet cardboard. THIS is a bad omen. Seriously, this smells like a frat house the day after an all nighter.		Slight bitterness leads one to realize this is not filtered water. Rather, it is similar to light, mass-brewed, American lagers and deserves to be consumed very cold, thus killing all flavor that is present.		The mouthfeel is thin and watery, just not good. And where is that alcohol?		Looks simply don't make for a good beer. Maybe this was disrespected before I found it, but why waste money to find out. Even the drain tried to reject this one."
"A: thin pale gold with near clear watery edges. No head and no lace. I caught a glimpse of white fizz after the pour and that was it		S: watery grains of corn and barley with a light sugary syrup sniff. Soft metallic whiffs as well		T: in most regards I would say ""artificial."" There is some cooked grains with maybe a dusting of hops, or so I like to think. Hops may come across with a vegetable type flavor		M: bubbly with a somewhat medium style body within the light category		D: not really much to this, I mean nothing at all"
"Thanks to Jw347 for this brew.		Before pouring this one you can already smell the coffee, which makes way for the bourbon. Some chocolate thrown in.		Looks a dark brown not much of a head for me. 		Hops, coffee, bourbon, in that order. The bourbon is too strong for me. Its not a beer anymore. Its a bourbon with brewers yeasts.		Lingering bourbon aftertaste. Warms your cockels.		Great if you love bourbon, I dont like it though. Maybe aged it would be better. For me this beer was like the rape scene in deliverance, some people think its a classic, for me it leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
Poured beer out of bottle into a pint glass, beer is a crimson-dark amber color with a slight creamy head. The smell is overwhelmingly of grapefruit and pine, interesting. The taste too is of grapefruit and pine, with a hoppy finish and alcoholic bite. The mouthfeel was enjoyable, full bodied with a creamy consistency and adequate carbonation. Overall, I have to say that this beer is not very drinkable due not only to the very high alcohol content, but also because of the overwhelming sweet and bitterness. I love IPAs, but this was not what I was expecting. Worth trying though.
"drank on 9.30.08 at home, poured from bottle into wide mouth glass. 		good looking pour, hazy dark orangy copper, great head, almost 2 fingers, nice tan off white color. head sticks around as I wrote this, great high lacing as it dissipated. good hoppy smell, very oily smell. the resins almost coat your nose. there is a slight sweet smell underneath.		obvioulsy quite a hoppy beer with the mega IBU's in this brew. flavory spreads nicely until you swallow and realize the hops pretty much kill everything left in your mouth. besides hops, there is a piney undertone, but the hops are too strong and ruin the palate. don't drink this beer if you expect to taste more beers after it."
this euro lager was poured into a tall pilsner glass and produced a pale yellow color with weak head that lead to weak lacing. their is a super skunky smell to this brew upon opening of the pop top. tatse is weak on hops weak on malts and weak on flavor. clean and crisp as water, a little grainy. not bad to wash food down, not good for much else.
Poured cloudy gold with thin head and thin spotty lacing. Smell of hops. Taste is sweet at fist then pretty bitter. head remains throughout. Almoust a sour feel to the mouth, not very pleasant. This Beer wasn't too impressive, not something i would get again.
"Burnished, medium-dark amber with a multitude of fine particulates that I assume are yeast. All bets are off on the slightly larger particles. Not a bad look for the beer, but the cap leaves a little something to be desired. It's off-white, stiff and exceedingly unsticky. Needless to say, there's no lace.		Some beer of this style manages to surprise and actually smell like malt (grain at least) and hops. Bogemia isn't one of them. It isn't offensive, but it isn't any damn good either. It smells unnatural somehow, chemical, vegetal, not really like beer at all. I'm having trouble describing it. Frankly, I've stopped caring.		This is lousy beer, plain and simple. First of all, let's get the style thing out the way. No way, no how is this beer anything other than a Euro strong lager. Even though it doesn't smell very alcoholic, the flavor shows every bit of the 8.4% ABV. It tastes like Russian moonshine from a rusty still. I'm beginning to be worried that if I drink the entire bottle, I'll go blind.		Bogemia tastes like a garden variety Euro strong lager right out of the chute. Grain alcohol quickly takes the upper hand and then the whole shebang collapses into a metal-flaked mess and makes me want to gargle with an IPA. There isn't even any malt liquor corny sweetness to ease the journey over the taste buds. I'm looking for the words 'pour contents into clogged drain, let stand for... ', but the brewery has chosen to leave such helpful directions off the label.		It's difficult to be objective about the mouthfeel when the flavor is so overwhelmingly bad. Separating one from the other takes a supreme effort, believe me. The beer is firm, harsh (or is that the flavor?) and undercarbonated. It doesn't really matter in the end. 		Bogemia is the only offering listed on BA for Stakhanovitz. Either no one has yet tried the others or the brewers figure they reached perfection with this particular beer and feel no need to release any others. Do yourself a favor and stay far away. Far, far, far away. Farther... farther... there, that oughta do it."
Very hoppy aroma and taste. Excellent appearance on the pour, almost clear yellow, with a frothy whire head and good lacing. I could not detect much flavor outside the heavy hops. This actually grew on me after a couple, but my beer is how I rated it. An okay-good, middle of the road pilsner.
I know why my girlfriend drinks so much of this: It tastes like nothing and there is hardly any alcohol. I poured it into a glass. That was a mistake because the color of this beer won't change much on the way out. I taste hops (I think) but they have an artificial twist to them. The aroma is of skunky beer, I was told by the girlfriend that is what it is supposed to smell like. While not high on my list, I can still understand why some folks would drink one of these. They are easy to drink, it's one saving grace (maybe a stretch).
"I've been hoping to try this one out for awhile now; here's my review. 12 oz. bottle, thanks to ""projectflam86""...		Appearance: tenaciously-driven: illustriously tenebrous, and holds its weight solidly; looks like third-world oil... its head is reassuring and doesn't have too much of an outward flow. Impressive. Mighty-fine lace; takes a good while for the caramel-coloured froth-head to finally settle back in place, but when it does its vainglory still sits well out of reach in the glass. 		Smell: Chirst Almighty! Ever shop at a Fresh and Easy and buy some Black Mexican coffee? Initially, this is its first odor; actually, its component in my nose would have to be bourbon--straight-up; the oatmeal character is faint, so faint without trying a sip you'd never be able to recognize it fully.		Taste: first sip I got a handful of cigarettes and bonfire smoke; then some burnt-black coffee bean notes, but almost no oatmeal character; I really had to focus deeply to find it; you shouldn't have to try that hard for a flavour that's marked right on the bottle...		Mouthfeel: sticky and complex; usually stouts make a mess in your mouth and this is no exception.		Drinkability: like Guinness, you think its higher in ABV due to the fact on how bitter and thick it is--but its ABV's not only noticed, it's down-right reckless. Good, good, good, but no thank you.."
No head on dark orange tinged yellow. Smelled and tasted like apple juice, spiked. Thin and harsh acidic . A step above drain pour. Why brew this? Charity sucked me in.I'm the one to bring it all the way to the Ohio gathering, I'm the one to blame.
"On tap at Tribes Alehouse.	Served in a Bell's tulip.		A dark frothy pinkish red. Huge, thick, creamy monster 2 finger head. Looks great... Sadly, it starts to fall apart after that...		The smell is sweet. Cherries and booze-- brandy? Some oak notes come through too.		Taste has a sweet liquor and cherry note that comes off as medicinal-- like cough syrup. It tries too hard for my taste-- I like my fruit beer simple and tasty. The aging has dried it out on the finish, allowing the booziness to really come out at you.		The mouthfeel is nice- creamy and thick. Good carbonation.		This isn't horrible, but it isn't one that I'll be buying again."
"On tap 9/15/04 at Cedar Brewing Co.		Copper colored with a low off-white head. Prominent unpleasant buttery diacytyl aroma and flavor dominates over everything else. Light bodied with a biting finish.		A very poor Red Ale; American, Irish or otherwise... way too buttery and one you should ask to taste before buying... maybe this was a bad batch because I don't remeber it being this bad during prior visits...		Per beer menu: ""Irish Red"" & per CB website ""Malted barley and Crystal malt""		4.0% ABW / 5.0% ABV"
"500ml Brown bottle poured into a Duvel glass, well in date.		Will I never learn? My son lived near Hammersmith (Polish Capital of the UK) for a few years and each time I visited I'd try and find a good Polish beer from the multitude of shops selling Polish goods, this wasn't it! I have one beer left (a Porter), I hope it is at least better than this. I am sure Poland produces some great beers, they just don't export them to the UK.		Looked OK, lager gold, almost Dort in its dullness and darkness. A good white head sat on top, the head soon fell away though.		My normal score of 3 for an odourless Lager.		Couldn't even taste the 7% alcohol, no body, no presence, no reason to buy another, very disappointing."
"Appearance  This is a dingy orange in color with a decent head that went down rather quickly.		Smell  This is very light malty grain with a bit of booze.		Taste  The sugary Pixie Stix shows the drinker no mercy whatsoever. Chase that with a shot of cheap Russian vodka and there you go.		Mouthfeel  I like the body on this lager. Its big if not quite medium-bodied and heavy but creamy in between the cheeks.		Sinkability  If this was like a three ounce bottle I might be able to make it, but half a liter seems like a lifetime with this crap."
This beer was dark brown with ruby highlights. There was a good head on this beer. The smell was chocolate-malty with no hop notes, finishing with a faint coffee aroma. The taste was chocolate, coffee, biscuit malty, and nicotine. The body was very full. The nicotine flavor was strong and a put off for me.
"Sampled at Toronto Beer fest '08.		A - Clear copper with almost no foam at all.		S - Fruity with lots of alcohol in the nose. Apples and red wine.		T - Very, very sweet. Reminds me of apple juice with alcohol in it, finish is moderately bitter.		M - Light, wine-like mouthfeel. Low carbonation.		D - Basically tastes like a sweetened apple cider with notes of a light red wine. Don't like it much."
"Thanks gford217		After trying the Smuttynose Wheat Wine and a couple others that I really enjoyed, I have to admit I was pretty pumped to get my hands on this. 		Almost no head even after an aggressive pour. Its orange, barely any activity. Its sort of just sitting there.		Smells pretty good. Sugary booze, barrel, maple syrup. Potent, stimulating.		Too sweet, too boozy. Too much bourbon and maple syrup. Pleasant touch of vanilla quickly destroyed by everything that is too big about this beer. Not much of a wheat character. Sip able, but more abrasive than a decent scotch."
"I shared this 750ml bottle recently (a present from Britanny).	It poured well to form a decent white head on a red-amber body. Biere au malt tourb. I looked it up ; tourb is peat.	It smelled of roasted malts (no hops) and a sweetness from somewhere.	Tasted firstly of sweet malts (a little to sweet for me), but worse it had a cloying, clinging metallic aftertaste. Definitely more metallic than peaty. This aftertaste overpowered the primary taste.	I have never taste a Belgian dark ale anything like this (thankfully)."
"Appearance: Pours a thick looking amber, with a minimal offwhite head. Not much going on for lacing or anything else here.		Smell: Nice floral bouquet with a fantastic malt background. Seems well balanced, and is very enticing. The hops aren't quite as intense as I expected, but they're present.		Taste: I'm not so impressed, but this could be a lot worse. The hops and malts are both very noticeable, with the malt kinda stealing the show. The hops take a step back, which is not what I like in my double ipas. The caramel of the malt is too intense with the high alcohol and reminded me more of an american barleywine.		Mouthfeel: Rather bitter on the swallow, but does not linger on the aftertaste. This is a problem for me, as I always expect a good lingering, if not growing bitterness from a double ipa.		Drinkability: Wow, hard to get down and finish because of the dichotomy of malts and hops and the high alcohol."
"Another fine malt beverage courtesy of Phil.		A: This one is a golden straw sort of color with a white head that disappears almost immediately.		S: Oh goodness, this one is not good. Corn, cooked vegetables, skunk, and alcohol up front. Actually, those aromas were pretty much present throughout.		T: Not a pleasant flavor either. The first sip (and each subsequent one) was tough to choke down. Alcohol, tons of corn, miscellaneous grains, and a synthetic/chemical thing going on.		M: The body is medium, for a malt liquor, I guess. Carbonation is quite high.		D: This was just awful. This one, I am glad I cannot purchase readily in California. Just to reiterate: awful."
I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nasty cloudy color kinda rust colored. I guess you could say. The beer tasted more like like some kind of juice. It was very sweet also. I poured it down the drain after several hits. I will not buy again.
"The colour is light golden yellow; the white three fingers thick foam is quite compact. 		The sultry smell is artificial with some sweet malt, hops and a hint of yeast.		The carbonation is strong and a little sharp with medium sized bubbles.		The taste is sweet and malty with a quite small body; the bitterness is weak and sort of chemical. The aftertaste is short with an artificial flavour of mild hops. 		A Euro lager below the average that is only sold in the Danish-German border market chain Calle to a very low price."
"bottle from a bottle shop in auckland.	pours a nice black darkness with a bit of head and some decent lacing...	Nose has a lot of smoke on it, and an odd vegetable smell. Hops are subdued, which may be the odd vegetable smell, more along the lines of a pea smell...	Taste is not so good, i am looking for a date on this bottle, and it is one of the few i have seen that does not have a best by date... seems old. Hops are not really there, though they dont really taste stale either.... just seems like they are missing. possibly some english style hops in there, but the American Black Ale is wrong. A bit of coal, and some smoke on the palate as well, but the main thing this is supposed to have, it is completely lacking. 	mouthfeel is medium, well carbed, nice on all fronts but where it needs to be. Big failure, in my opinion."
"Visiting family this weekend netted me an unusual four pack. I was chatting up the beer part of my family when my Aunt comes walking over telling me I MUST review this collection of beer. Bunch of kirklands... well, here goes Auntie!		Vision	Pretty interesting finger of egg shell head rests above a honey colored body. Little bit of carbonation seen in the midst of the liquid. I was a little thrown back by how dark a body this pale ale possessed.		Bouquet	Little bit of fruit noted, mostly citrus in nature. Minor hops and partial malt character. Not much to note here. It seems interesting, but faint throughout. 		Flavor Profile	Unfortunate notes to make here. Very strong hop body that is overwhelming. Bitter enough that I could swear they got the style wrong. Faint sweetness from the malts but overwhelmingly hoppy. Confusingly so. 		The finish is moderately clean with the hops fading away almost as quickly as the drink goes down. This saves the flavors from being noted as anything worse than what it is rated.		Oral Sensations	Decent body for this. Not overly watery to note. Extremely carbonated however. Very distracting when I feel the pinch all over my tongue,.		Conclusions	I'd drink it again if it was given to me free. I'm not sure if I would choose this over something less oppressive... May even take an American Adjunct Lager over this."
"A- poured into a dimple mug a yellow straw color with a white head a bit hazy looking.		S- grass and malts		T- Hoppy with an unsual aftertaste that all Stoudt beers seem to have. Sorry Stoudts not diggin this one.		M- medium body ,decent ccarbonation		O- Not what I would call a German pilsner,,compared to the real deal."
"Like drinking beef jerky.		So this beer pushed by beer reviewing philosophy. Does one review beers based on style or based on beer as an overarching beverage? My philosophy is to rate beers by style. In this case I'm not particularly fond of smoked beers, so I'd always rather reach for a good stout, porter or amber ale. But when comparing this beer to other smoked beers (like NABC's Cone Smoker) this beer is best in class.		I'm probably not going to add much to what others have said in their well written reviews. The smell and taste remind me of meat. Being a Michigan boy I recommend drinking this beer with venison on a cold winter day. 		I have to think that drinking more than a pint of this beer in one sitting is difficult for anyone and the flavors are so powerful."
"a: Dark copper to amber, with good clarity. Very little foam or froth on the surface.		s: Grainy aroma with a vague hint of sweetness.		t: Disappointingly light. Characteristically bitter with a malty, creamy body. Fruity and musty undertones. Grassy, earthy hop flavors absent.		m: Creamy, with a wet, refreshing finish.		Overall one of the least pleasing beers I have recently had. I enjoy an American style pale ale quite a lot and this brew was not what I had bargained for."
"A- nice 1.5 finger head that slowly recedes to a thin cap. Nice ruby color with some nice yeast in suspension. 		S- Chocolate Cherry's (of course) very malt driven. A bit of caramel. 		T- Quite sour, lambic-esque/farmhouse, but not in a good way. Not really any chocolate or cherries other than a touch in the otherwise sour finish. 		M- Cloying carbonation that is rough on the palette. 		D- Not a great beer at all. If I want chocolate covered cherries, I will reach for a brother thelonius."
"Bottle shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike!		The beer appears transparent and light in orange in color. The head is approximately a half inch thick and leaves some decent lacing in its wake. The aroma has a subtle hop presence with a strange scent emanating from the beer. Uh oh. The flavor is mediocre, with very muted hop and citrus. Overall the beer just tastes a bit off kilter. The finish is rather dry, and leaves an unpleasant vegetal taste on the palate. Not my bag, baby."
"""All for one, one for all. We are one nemesis."" - Arch Enemy		Big beer weekend beer #2!		Clear, rusty, whiskey colored orange. Thin white head fades to nothing and mine glass looks like a neat glass of tequila oro. Smells of orange citrus hops, Gran Marnier, sweet maple and booze aplenty. Taste is similarly sweet and syrupy orange with sweet maple and bourbon flavored heat. 		Not sure what the fuss is all about on this one."
"This was the most bland of the Marco Island offerings.		A - Pours wit a finger of foam that settles to a thick ring and partial cap. The body is a slightly hazed dark orange-brown.		S - The aroma is slightly bready, with a few light herbal hop notes. Boring, but not offensive.		T - Tastes pretty similar to the nose - not much else to say here. It's got a bit more malt weight than the other beers.		M - Similar to all the other beers at Marco Island. Medium-light body, medium-low carbonation, and a pretty bland but clean finish.		D - Meh."
"I had to go to a baby shower this afternoon. First, it's a baby shower and second, there were two good music festivals in the Los Angeles area. At least they had Amstel Light. 		The pour is the only part of this beverage that resembles beer. It's a watery amber with a cream colored head. The nose has a faint scent of grain and a hop aroma that would be overpowered by a Pliney the Younger resting fifty feet away, up wind. The taste has much more in common with soda water than beer. Have you ever tried one of those vitamin waters? This tastes like pilsner-flavored sparkling vitamin water, only with less flavoring. 		All and all, the shower wasn't so bad."
"I tried this beer a few weeks ago and when I poured it there was absolutely no head. I drank it anyway but decided not to review it. Last night I gave it another chance and again there was no head.		A - No head. Zero. Dark ruby/brown		S - raisons and prunes		T/M - Full, reminds me of those chocolate oranges. By the end, it was quite cloying. Very little carbonation.		D - I would not drink more than one because the mouthfeel is to syruppy/cloying.		By the end it was completely flat. Overall it has some decent flavour but the lack of carb./head has turned me off. I'm pretty sure I'll never buy this beer again."
"Pours a crystal clear pale yellow water like color. A head of just forced almost fake like carbonation which is amazingly off putting. 		Sweet grain cereal, a touch and I mean a touch of perhaps bananas and cloves? This has the subtle aromas of a hef but extremely subtle. Im actually rather ok with this aroma. High hopes going from here. That said I may just be looking for aromas when they aren't there. 		Well so much for that. Theres virtually nothing to even speak of in this beers flavors. It is bland just hints of grain and water. 		Weird over carbonated.well it is a light lager I suppose.		This beer is terrible. Im not sure what a light lager can do to make itself good, but this beer made no effort."
"I'm so bummed to write this review.		In May, I visited Pike Brewery several times over the course of my trip to Seattle. I had a blast at night for a party, then had an even better time hanging out and meeting nice beer folks the next day. I even bought a bunch of shirts and glasses. The 5X was the beer that will always remind me of my trip, great times exploring a wonderful city.		Since then, I've ordered the 5X through mail order places several times, promoted Pike's product to my friends, and worn my T-Shirt so much it's starting to fade.		I was giddy the morning I saw Liquid Solutions had this up. I bought 6 bottles on the spot. Well, I'm no longer a devout Pike fan after this disgrace of a beer. Have the decency to not release a product that you know is infected, it costs a lot less than loosing your reputation!		Poured from a waxed bottle into my tulip.		Oh shit - it's foaming up. The air smells like bourbon and sour funk - it smells like I just mixed an Ommegang Rouge and a shot of Makers. Not good, this is going to be a heartbreaker. My glass is 1/4 black liquid and 3/4 mocah head that is overflowing. G-R-E-A-T.		Tastes like I feared. There is a decent enough beer buried somewhere in here, but a sour taste just makes it completely lost. On top of the absurdly thin mouth on this, it also is so damn carbonated I can't even taste all the details. Mouthfeel is the worst I've ever had for a Stout. Sharp and really feels like pop rocks on my lips.		Pike, I love your amazing space in perhaps the greatest city in this country. I really enjoy your 5X stout. But a passionate promoter of your brewery just became a disenchanted customer - all because a special premium version of your premier product was unfit to be released but you released it anyway. I'll still happily quaff your releases when I find them on tap, but I won't be paying a premium to get your products shipped to me in Cleveland, OH any more. Please do the right thing and don't release an infected beer like this again. You're doing a disservice to both your fans and those who don't know any better. We've grown to expect much, much more from you."
"Presentation: 1 pt. 0.9 oz bottle into a nonic. No freshness/best by date indicated.		A- Copper and clear. Pours with ~2 fingers of light tan head, which fade slowly.		S- Moderate bready/yeasty/butter odor. Some floral hopiness. Slightly metallic twinges.		T- Mild malty breadiness. Bitterness on the finish has an almost metallic quality, and little in the way of redeeming hop flavors. Mineral bite is extremely dry/borderline astringent. Not a pleasing symphony here.		M- Moderate carbonation, and somewhat thin/light.		D- Not good. The extreme, biting dryness gets bothersome rather quickly IMO.		Future outlook: Old bottle? Hard to say. Without any notation on the bottle from which to deduce freshness, I can't really see any reason to give this one another shot."
"One of the most unique beers I've ever had.	I was expecting something much darker, but it pours a reddish amber color but with bronze highlights.	The smell is definitely chocolate, but with a slight hint of malt and a little sweet fruit...although not immediately identifiable as cherry.	The taste is VERY unique. It's slightly sweet, not Lambic-level, but still moreso than a typical fruit beer. There's a little bit of malt flavor but it's VERY chocolatey. I've had lots of beers that claim to be chocolate flavored (a la the Samuel Adams) but this is the first one to truly capture it. It's like nothing I've ever had before. The cherry flavor really only appears as a faint aftertaste, but it's certainly there.		The beer feels very thick in your mouth. It just feels very thick/heavy and warm...no matter how chilled it might be. Personally I didn't care for that aspect, but to each their own!		The beer is a treat to taste, but I think about 1/4 of one is all I could ever handle just because of the thickness of it. I bought a 6-pack of this and I think I ended up throwing out half of it just because one is enough. They should've sold this one in bombers instead.		I think everyone should try this at least once just because it's guaranteed to be like nothing you've ever had before. Again, this really should've been in singles."
"had this suggested to me at my local tavern. i tried it as this was a new arrival.	poured into a glass, i thought someone switched my beer with their old motor oil. boy is this ever black. short-lived head. strong burnt coffee smell with a hint of something sweet. definitely tasted the malts, no bit of hops at all. tried sipping, but, i just wanted to finish this and get something else, boris the crusher had crushed every last drop of fluid from my mouth, this is extemely DRY. i'm probably not the right guy to review this as i am not a major fan of imperial stouts. i would not get this again, it is worth a try...but are'nt they all."
"Amber with hints of orange with big tan foamy head with good retention and uneven lacing. Big citrus hop aroma. Big bitter grapefruit up frony with good caramel mellowing backbone. Smooth, silky feel with a low carb feel despite the big foamy head.		A good overhopped IPA that's pleasant yet slightly one dimensional. Not worth $13.50/6 pack unless you really need a good IPA in a can."
"Upon pouring, I get a half glass of amber colored beer and a half glass of thick, frothy white head. Seems a little charged up to me. Not a good sign. Sweet grainy smell with some baked bread and a little citrus. Not a good sign was right. This one is not on. Highly carbonated and not enjoyable at all. Flavor is bland and a little off. A little cardboard. Nothing ""APA"" like in it at all. I've had 3 O'sos so far. 2 very good. 1 very not good."
"Zaibo pours a deep-golden that borders on amber. It's creamy bright white head drops readily to a wide collar and whispy surface covering. Very fine bubbles can be clearly seen rising quickly toward the surface. Large spots are left behind on the glass, but no real lace. 		The nose reveals a sweetish and grainy, almost caramel-and-candy-like aroma with a clear note of alcohol, some ethyl acetate, and perhaps, dimethyl sulphate. It becomes quite ""hot"" as it warms.		In the mouth it's full bodied and dextrinous with a gently caress of the tongue due to its fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation. 		The flavor is initially softly sweet with a ceral-like side, but as it warms it becomes more candyish as the alcohol appears. Once warm, notes of light caramel emerge, but by that point the alcohol leaves a bit of spice that rounds it off. Bitterness is present, and clearly shows at the swallow, lingering in the semi-dry finish with some residual candyish notes and alcohol. 		Fermented properly to avoid all of the excess alcohol, this might be interesting, but as it is it's flawed."
On tap at the brewpub. Kolsch works if you get it right, but it seems to be easy to get wrong and here I got a thin although appropriately carbonated sweet-sourness that wasn't intended and did not work together. Malting down of astringency could not hide the defects.
"Appearance: Very, very pale straw color. Almost looked watery. Luckily the head was a little creamy and appealing.	Smell: Like all light beers. Adjunct malts and a corn smell.	Taste: Like many light beers, but not annoying. Not much to taste, but it goes done easy, almost like water.	Mouthfeel: Light and creamy. A nice texture.	Drinkability: If I want to drink a lot, I could drink some of these."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Reddish in color, like a rose wine. The head is almost non-existent, and dissapears before you get it to your nose for a smell.		The beer gives off a bit of a fruity smell, but not much, to be honest.		You can tell that this is brewed with cherry puree, as cherry is the dominant taste. It's a bit on the creamy side as well, and you can pick up a little hoppy bitterness under the malty sweetness. Feels like a bit of lemon under the cherry, or perhaps it's just sour cherry masquerading as lemon.		I'd like to give it more for drinkability, but, to tell the truth, I didn't finish the one I had.		I wouldn't have this with more than potato chips or pretzels."
"Pours a dark golden in color with massive amounts of carbonation, but there is only about one-quarter to one-half inch of foamy white head that dissipates rather quickly, but actually leaves a medium amount of lacing down the glass. The aroma is surprisingly akin to a Polish strong lager and much less sweet than I expected. There is some sweetness, fresh harvested dry fall grain, some straw and a touch of lager funk. Only a slight touch of green apple and no metallic notes. 		There is much more sweetness in the taste, nearing cloying but just enough hops are in this to prevent cloying, barely. The taste is not as good as the aroma as an element of circus peanut sweet fruitiness enters in, and not in a good way. This is not really that good, it is borderline drinkable, but still on the drinkable side. Some high alcohol malt liquors taste so bad they are essentially undrinkable. I am glad I finally got to try the Ides, but when I am seeking out a repeat malt liquor, it won't be this one.		Considering it is a cheap malt liquor, I would give the appearance and aroma of this a 9 out of 10. However, I would give the taste a 3 out of 10."
"A- Hazy honey color with a one finger head that fades fast and leaves a thin film. Miniscule lacing.		S- Subdued/bland aromas of citrus, earth, caramel malt, and just a touch of sweet oranges.		T- Bready malts and stale grapefruit juice. Finishes with a dull and forgettable bitterness.		M- Thin to medium texture with moderate carb.		O- Maybe I'm having an off day when it comes to tasting, but this beer didn't impress me one bit. Boring, bland, and an all around disappointment. Don't worry about it Founders, you can't hit it out of the park every-time. Not recommended. Cheers."
This beer is the perfect example of pedestrian swill. I have been drinking various IPAs and stronger ales lately. I had an Arrogant Bastard the night before drinking this, and i happened to enjoy it very much. the only way to describe this beer is as follows: someone slipped me this beer, and by the time i realized it wasnt really bad seltzer water, i was finished with it. it pours with all the characteristics of ginger ale, with heavy carboatoin, a large-bubbled head, and no lace. the color was yellow, nothing else. No smell, no taste besides the worn inside of an aluminum can. Not much pleasing about this beer, but i suppose if you're on a budget... well, I wouldnt even reccomend it for that situation. at least its still alcoholic.
"From the OCB discovery pack no. 2.	341ml bottle poured into a mug.		A - Poured a dark brown with a hint of red. No head. Not much carbonation either. Looks like cola that's gone flat.		S - Toasts and malts with a hint of coffee.		T - Caramel malts, burnt toasts, coffee, and hop bitterness at the end.		M - Flat. Minimal tingling of bubbles on the tongue. Smooth, bordering on watery. It's not doing it for me here.		D - Flat burnt coffee. One is enough for me."
I must give props to the makers of Amstel light for marketing this as an imported light beer so they can charge 20 bucks a case and become popular in the states. This is a watered down beer if you can call it that. Pours a light pale yellow with NO head. Smell is grainy and skunky. Taste is of slight hops with a watered down taste. No body at all. Not drinkable, drink water if thirsty. I thought I would never say this but I would have rather had a Bud Light than an Amstel light, that should put into perspective how much I disliked this beer.
"500ml NEW TASTE LOCK CAN with a lock that has turned blue to tell me that it's cold - what will they think of next!? Poured into a wine glass. 		A: Crystal clear and radiant amber-gold body that's brimming with fizziness on its way up to the coarse, fleeting white head. It's actually significantly richer in color than I was expecting, and the fizzy head does leave a few spots of lace. Not terrible, but I just have to subtract an appearance point because of the hideously garish, gimmicky can.		S: Stale grain, and absolutely nothing else. No hops, no sweetness, no nothing - just dry, husky, boring graininess. At least there's nothing off about it, but damn this is one forgettable-smelling lager.		T: Ah, here is where the true torture begins. The staleness of the grain multiplies exponentially, bringing in overtones of stable hay and rotting grass. There's a distinct metallic bite on the tail end (although surely the TASTE LOCK CAN can't have affected the flavor negatively), and it finishes with dull dryness that some might call crisp, but I would call piercingly insipid. This tastes like a beer that worked hard to make itself as boring as possible, and in that respect it's a success.		M: Thin and prickly, just as I expected. The high carbonation level actually does succeed in adding a touch of creaminess eventually, though, although I hate to leave it in my mouth long enough for this redeeming feature to materialize. Pretty standard.		O: This is the first beer I'm having on my trip to England and Belgium, and I'm drinking it for two reasons: first, so I have nowhere to go but up; second, so I can make room in my host's fridge for the better beer that I will help him pick out. To his credit, though, this was left by another guest, so at least my friend didn't commit the heinous sin of paying money for freaking Carling. What a crappy, boring beer - it makes High Life or PBR taste positively complex and well-crafted.		Cheers!"
I tried. I really tried to like this brew, but I just don't like it. Looks great, pours like a champ, nice color great lasting head. And that's the best part. Where's the nose? I don't get a thing here. Bitter to the end, but not much else IMO, a one trick pony. A little boozy, I can taste the alcohol, and the finish leaves a lot to be desired. I'm fighting drinking this six, but I won't buy it again there are too many others out there to taste or buy. Too bad a great brewery IMO missed the mark, or maybe they hit it. It's a tribute to Centennial, so maybe it's a me thing.
The true epitome of mediocracy. What a waste. If I wanted water, I would've bought water. Poured out to a nearly pathetic yellow clear color, with little head, no lace, and rather low carbonation. Scent? I think I smelled corn and hops, but it was so damn light it could've been a dog fart. Flavor was very weak, notes of corn and malt. Finished blandly, no aftertaste or anything. This beer is like a 90 Lb. Halfback. It's just not gonna cut it. Needs more flavor, much more flavor. Could be reviewed lower, but I was not repulsed by this brew (maybe only the inflated price). Not recommended.
"APPERANCE 4.0-looked very tasty. had all the attributes of what a bourbon barrel stout should look like. the pour said alot about the beer including a major drawback which i felt took away from the beer and that is the amount of carbonation i could see and later feel/taste.		SMELL 5.0-a very delicious smell came from this beer. you can smell a varitey of smells ranging from oak,chocolate,vanilla,bourbon,cocoa. oh only if this beer tasted as well as it smelled :(		TASTE 2.5- the reason i gave this beer such a low rating on taste was how not tasty it was. as soon as i took my first drink i felt like i just wasted 10.50 on this 4-pack. it was very carbonated and taste like they made a great batch of beer than decieded to make profit by making have the bottle with water. just did not taste like a mans beer.		MOUTHFEEL 2.5- once again i would have to give this another 2.5 rating because even thought i knew i was drinking beer my mouth was telling me what a fizzy interesting soda this is. very fizzy in your mouth. could taste the flavors but could not get past the carbonation.		DRINKABILITY 2.5- overall i would have to say that is a little under average for the drink factor. the 8.5% ABV does sneak up on u though. once again i would have to bring in the fizz and watery taste in this beer."
"Reviewed from notes.		Pours a pale golden color. Quite clear with visible carbonation. Smells mostly of grain. Taste brings grain and some husks along with the faintest hint of hops. Mouthfeel is light with loads of carbonation. Overly carbonated without much flavor, not too drinkable."
"Good old Carling lager sold in most pubs across the country and associated with football hooligans and sadly for Celtic football club also sponsors their team shirts.		Carling has a somewhat unique taste to it as it is somewhat sweet. There is nothing very special about the flavour though and the fizzyness is quite about. Really quite a dull beer and too much of this and you won't feel too great for a few days. Carling is a typical persons lager and is not worth drinking if you prefer better beers."
"A: Poured a very clear, pale yellow color with a big fluffy white head. Visible carbonation was very strong. 		S: Strong skunky aroma emits from the green bottle upon opening.On the nose was some fresh buttery corn. 		T: sweet and buttery corn flavor with a light herbal hopping. There was some vegetable aftertaste. 		M: syrupy, fizzy from the carbonation, and rather bland. 		D: Don't really care for this in one serving let along several. Pass."
"Let's get this out of the way right now: this is not Okocim Porter. Duh. I knew that it wasn't going to live up to one of the best porters on the planet. I was, however, hoping for something better. Something much better. Alas, this is not a particularly good beer.		It looks nice. Pours what appears to be black until you hold it up the light, and then it's a ruby-brown of sorts. The off-white head produces plenty of lacing. The appearance is the strong suit of the beer.		The aroma is really what turns me off to the beer. This shit smells soapy. Soapy as hell. I smell nothing else but detergent. Very uncool.		The flavor is a definite step up from the smell, but it's nothing special. Mildly malty with a metallic bite on the finish.		Mouthfeel is far too thin for the style. Carbonation is where it should be, but the body is far too Paris Hilton when it should be -- at the very least -- Beyonce.		Overall, this is not something I plan on drinking again. Granted, it was a free bottle that I received due to an error, but that still doesn't make it a good beer. I'll stick with Okocim's exceptional porter, thank you very much."
"Found this little stubbie bottle at the Kensington Wine Market, and thought it may have been Morrocon or Egyptian at first. But sunuvagun, it's from Ethiopia, that makes things more interesting. 5.5% listed on the bottle for abv.		Pours out a red cola hue, looks more akin to a bock than a stout. Quick fizzle of beige head that disipates quickly, and leaves a thin spotted film on top of the beer. 		The aroma is akin to a strong dark Belgian ale, although comes very close as well to that one bad Baltic porter that I sampled a long time ago. I'm getting dates and raisins that had been liberally soaked in rum in the aroma, a little bit of chocolate and a lot of cloyingly sweet malt extract. But the overwhelming theme that I'm picking up is that of dates. 		The flavour is mildly schizophrenic, as if this stout can't decide what exactly it wants to be. All that ripe flavour I previously encountered has completely disappeared, in fact I don't taste much of anything until well into the aftertaste when some roasted malt rises up and makes an appearance. By the time this stuff reaches room temperature (can ya tell I haven't been frantically chugging away at this stuff?) a marriage of sweet malt and thick chewy dates starts to slowly emerge around the middle of the sip and stands in together at the finish. The roasted malt, as always, continues to lurk in the aftertaste.		The mouthfeel is on the thin side, but gets a bit of backbone from some carbonation, providing this stout with a curious texture. Curious as in ""what the heck is going on?"", rather than ""this is a mystery I'd love to explore and get to the bottom of, c'mon Scooby-Doo!"". 		I'm happy to have had the chance to sample this stout from Ethiopia, I'm not pining away for my lost cash that went towards the purchase of it, but I can confidently say I can't see myself buying another one of these, especially if I'm in the mood for a stout."
"I picked up this beer on a recent trip to Indianapolis to visit family.		The bottle makes me believe this is some kinda high-octane brew that will stupify my mind. Just what I need on a night like tonight with all the fire works and guns going off. 		It pours a very clear orange amber with a nicely vigorous frothy head that leaves a fair amount of lacing in my glass. The head is kind of strange it that i starts out looking really creamy, but then degenerates into a strange seafoam like froth.		Smell is unpleasant and I almost poured this one down the drain due to the unappealing and strange odor. I know I've smelled it before, but I can't quite remember where or what it was. Was it some kind of raisin and granola trail mix left in the sun to rot? Some odd dried fruit dessert concoction that was foisted on me my a cousin when I was young? Whatever it was, I have no fond memories of it. I decided to give it a try anyway.		Taste is like white grapefruit juice, but without any sweet component (and that is saying a lot given that there isn't much sweetness in white grapefruit). It is bitter without any piney or floral overtones. It is everything bad that hops have to offer. It has really no redeeming qualities except the promise of numbing my mind this evening. So I slag forward.		Mouthfeel, if one can get past the taste, isn't bad and has a nice degree of carbonation and slickness.		Alcohol is the only redeeming component of this beer."
"A: Poured a clear gold with a thin, frothy with head that soon dissipated leaving a slight rim lacing. Visible carbonation was light. 		S: There was a slight skunkiness upon opening which thankfull didn't translate to much to the actual nose. There was some light grains, fresh barley but was extremely light and had to work to get much of a scent. 		T: light, with some dried sweet buttery grains, with a grassy finish. There was some cabbage as well with some hay notes coming through as well.		M: light, buttery, with a slight sour hopping and fresh grass on the swallow with a soft carbonation presence. 		D: A pass on this one is simple enough"
"[Best served in an English pint]		Poured a clear light brown with a large frothy white head that dissapated quickly and had fair lacing. The aroma was pleasant with the scent of caramel malts, a sweet yeast and a mild grassy hop. It tasted mildly sweet in the beginning and finished about the same with a hint of caramel and hops with the flavor being very light and fading quickly at the finish. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a soft carbonation. Overall a very, very mild tasting brew. I think I like the name better than the beer."
"Best by: Oct 23, 2011		A: Pours a amber ale with brilliant clarity. Two fingers of peanut head falls over a few moments to a sheet of the same.		S: Hmmm, malt. Sweet malts. Not really getting any hops on the nose here. Lemme try again...Nope, malt and butterscotch. Fail.		T: So, still really malty. WTF. Damn nearly an amber. The bottle says 67 IBU, I can't believe it. There just must be sooo much residual sugar that the beer tastes like sweet wheat and barley malts. Man, this is the first I've had of the 24 pack my wife convinced me to buy, and I'm not really looking forward to the rest. Okay, a few minutes in and there's a hint of bitterness on the back end.		M: Medium body with moderate to low carb. Dry finish.		O: see above. Not impressive. Not an IPA."
"A: Amber with some bubbles that quickly disappear after the pour.		S: Reminiscent of Samiclaus. 		T: Sweet yet very clean with alcohol being the dominant feature. Lacks complexity. Alcohol burn in the finish.		M: A bit numbing.		D: I'm not sure cellaring would improve this, but if I pick up another bottle I'll give it a try."
"A - Chicory brown with solid black/brown core. Light rim of head with trace lacing.		S - Blast of bourbon. Hard woods, vanilla bean, brown sugar, booze. Almost overwhelming but it really grows on you.		T - Sweet molasses, bourbon. Vanilla, booze, oak, pepper, touch of smoke. Background notes of raisins and dark dried fruits. Extremely strong. Unlike the nose, punch from the flavor hits as hard on the last sip as it does on the first. 		M - Medium, almost perfect, body with a boozy dry finish. A little too much alcohol in the finish.		D - Way too powerful to rush through. It's a beer that should be enjoyed slowly, but carries so much punch you really don't have a choice."
"2009 bottle served in nearly appropriate glasses at the 28th annual East Coast Relocation Cellar Clearing Barley Wine Event.	It is dark red and ready for the fight, but the fight ends in the 1st round with an obnoxious metallic grin. The flavor mimics the aroma, but there is more. A grim robot dips his flaming arm in a cardboard bath of sin. There is an oxygenated sense of helplessness in this beer that is gripping. It is sour, metallic and wet cardboard all at once. A magnificent display of how not what to look like. This is a barleywine that has no soul. No old soul..Or if it does, a rancorous and foul one. Sad to say, this barleywine does not age with grace, at least not this vintage."
"Poured from 22 oz bomber		A - Hazy burnt orange with a thin tan head		S - Strong hop smell with hints of citrus rind, pine, and grass.		T - Hop bomb with a mix of citrus, pine, with a very strong alcohol taste. Hops for days. Not very well balanced.		M - Medium body with an almost gritty/dirty feel. good carbonation.		D - Thank god it was my last beer of the night because i couldn't taste anything after this hop bomb. If a taste bud killer is what they were aiming for that is what they got. Good for a one time try after that its all yours."
random exotic beer at my little corner grocery store. Maine= Lobster must have been the owners thinking. VERY cherry smell and almost no head on mine. alcohol became more prominent as I drank more and the last sip had allot of alcohol flavor on the mouth. overall very sweet and Malty would not buy again as I prefer hoppy beers but glad I tried it. 1 bottle gave me a buzz ( I must be getting old)
"500ml bottle 	4.9% abv 	I tried this beer on August 27, 2007 at 'Smokeless Joe's' in Toronto. The beer poured a translucent gold into a glass with a loose white head which didn't last very long. There was some hints of malt in the aroma, but not a lot. The mouthfeel was thin, with mild carbonation, and slightly slippery, reminiscent of wheat beers. The flavour was also a bit on the grainy side. Not a beer I would go out of my way to order again, but it did knock another country off my list."
"Pours a medium crystal clear orange with a short, and fast white head. 		Nose is assertive ripe fresh and pure assertive pineapple. 		Mouthfeel is nicely creamy and rich and tastes full and bold. 		Flavors follow nose and mouthfeel and are assertive, bold and distinctive. Unfortunately, there is an over riding sweet sugar/honey/syrup front end to the big malt which then goes to nice bitter lemon/grapefruit hops. However, the damage is done and the front end is just too almost sickeningly sweet. 		This one is way out of balance although the sweet grapefruit finish is pleasant and the highlight of the beer. Just not worth drinking through the front end to get to the nice finish."
"Pours a medium amber color with a thin but long lasting head. The nose is very distinct but hard to place - peanut butter is pretty close. 		The flavor is similarly buttery, with some malt sweetness and hop bitterness vying for attention in the background. The mouthfeel is thin and dominated by an agressive carbonation."
"Poured with a thick foamy, frothy, cream colored, sudsy head and some lace. Color is a clear medium amber with some chunky bit of sediment. Aroma is beery, sweet malt, and a bit of soap. Flavor is heavy malt, sweet, with a little hop bitterness. Body is malt heavy and good carbonation; good for the style. Finish is like flavor and like boozer's beer. Not for me."
Pours a five-finger light tan head that fades quickly leaving a good lace. Clear red/amber color. Hoppy/malty nose. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Starts hoppy and the hops dominate and leave a lingering bitter aftertaste. Expecting something a little more mellow. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma.
"Lightly malty with some fruity esters. A little bit of spicy hop. A touch dull.		Fairly clear pale gold colour with a creamy white head. Head retention could be improved but there is a little lacing.		Initially a touch grainy with a hint of malt. This flows through the barest hint of hops to a slightly tart finish. The tartness does not work well.		Medium body with moderate carbonation. A little bit astringent. 		Not a great beer for me. The flavour is a bit off and the astringency isn't all that nice."
I don't know where to start with this brew. I'm not even sure I'd recognize it as a DIPA to begin with. Weirdly sweet and not in a good way. The nose is kinda boozy, maybe even a faint hint of Scotch. and the taste follows. No citrus, no pine kick, where's the hops? A little bitterness in the middle, but that's not even very good, and I poured out the 3d of the six I have. I've never done this before but the remaining offensive bottles will probably be drain pours as well. I'd take3 bottles of PBR for this stuff, ask before FRI or it's down the drain.
"(Served in an American pint glass)		A- This beer has a straw yellow body with a thick creamy white head that boils into a rocky head and a big carbonation of big bubbles. 		S- The light smell of sulfur and green noble hops come through in the smell. 		T- The light taste of dry pale malt finishes with a bitter noble hop and a carbonic bit. There is a faint sulfur note that comes through the malt. 		M- This beer has a light mouthfeel with a big fizzy texture. The texture is also a bit watery in the beginning of the sip.		D- It is a light lager with all the clean cut flavors and smoothness. Not that exciting but maybe on a really hot day at a baseball game it would taste better."
"Sunny haystack gold with lemonade colored trim. This has to be the lightest doppelbock in the history of doppelbocks. The crown is several fingers of yellowed ivory foam that looks decent enough. More lace would be nice, but it wouldn't have resulted in a higher score.		The nose is exactly as expected for a primarily malty beer that is yellow in color. In other words, there isn't much to go on. A hint of musty Euro hoppiness is about it. Almost no alcohol and no overt nastiness are surprising.		Missing Elf tastes like every other Euro strong lager that has ever come down the pike. Who knows what the brewers were thinking when they called this beer a Double Bock. Then again, they probably don't subscribe to Beer Advocate style nomenclature.		Flavors include barley soaked in grain alcohol and bitter grasses. That's pretty much it. This big lager is close to hot and harsh, but tails off just enough on the finish to avoid offending (if you have a forgiving palate and a strong stomach). Time will probably take the edge off the bitterness and might soften the solvent-like alcohol as well.		The mouthfeel is firm (thanks to alpha acids and ethanol), but manages to avoid being ragged or loose. Proper carbonation is the reason why, though it can only do so much.		It's a shame that a picture isn't present as of this review. The label shows Santa nailing a 'Missing Elf' poster on a tree, while the elf in question is wedged between his butt cheeks. Too bad the beer isn't even one-tenth as imaginative."
"Poured into a pint glass.		This is one dark beer - can't see through it, to be sure. Minimal cream-colored head that last for more than two minutes.		Smells of smoke and burnt malt. Wow.		Here's how I describe the taste: Take your house and burn it down. Then take a piece of the burnt wood, add a drop of caramel to it, dunk it in a glass of water, and suck on it. This is the smokiest beer I've had to this point - holy cow!		This just did not work well in my mouth; you have to be a fan of rauchbiers to enjoy this one. If you are, this will rank pretty well with you.		To drinkability, this is a beer I just couldn't finish. Not even on a bet."
had this on tap at the Berkley Front earlier this summer. poured a nice amber with a nice sizes light tan head that left some nice lacing. aroma got some caramelized malts with some hops, a bit of fruitiness and that is all folks. flavor, not much going on here did get some malt and hops, has a bitter finish which would be the only thing going for it.
"12oz. bottled February 3rd, 2010, poured into my FFF's imperial pint...		Pours a thick orange/amber color, very hazy, with a one finger white head...leaves a cap of white haze on top of the beer and a little bit of lacing down the glass...		Smell is sweet with a bit of spice coming from the heavy bourbon aromas...definitely some syrup in there as well as a somewhat woody scent...		Whoah...boozy, too boozy! Gonna let it warm a bit...a little warmer now, a little more complexity, but still lots a bourbon. The first sip almost instantly gave me heartburn from the booze, the second sip was more bearable...and I think I am starting to like it. Sweet, vanilla and some syrup...tastes like an alcoholic breakfast. Overall pretty good, but a bit too much alcohol burn for my tastes...maybe some time will mellow this one out...		Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, very coating of the palette. Sticky and lingering. Too much booze though...		Definitely a sipper and something to savor...definitely not drinking more than one of these at a time...gonna give my other bottles some time before I revisit this one..."
"Appearance  Big carbonation leads to a big white fluffy head. Very pale straw color.		Smell  Strong astringent smell. Some straw.		Taste  Very watery. Some faint bready malts. Nothing really here.		Mouthfeel  Like most cheap beers its watery, thin and over carbonated. Sweet, dry and fizzy.		Drinkability  I have never liked this beer, even before I started drinking a better variety. Below average even for the style."
"Founders site calls this brew ""the coffee lovers consummate beer"".	I will definitely give them that. 		Poured into a pint glass. Served at 45-50.		A - The darkest brown possible without being black. Head is 1.5 fingers with a beautiful dark tan color that leaves some nice lacing as the brew is consumed.		S - Coffee, coffee, and burnt malt & burnt coffee. Some hops. Slight chocolate as well. Not too bad overall, but the burnt malt/coffee just dominates and smells...well...burnt. The smell lets you know what's coming. 		T - Very coffee. A bitter and burnt finish that won't go away. Not very complex overall.		M - Full-bodied. Very good for the style.		D - I was disappointed, overall, for such a highly rated brew, but this is not a beer that I would choose again. If you are looking for ""the coffee lovers consummate beer"" and don't mind a bitter, burnt finish, this is the beer for you."
Good looking pint  looked somewhat gold/amber with a nice whitish head, but I was in a darkened Timber Creek Bar & Grill. Faint malty aroma. First taste in the mouth was fairly grainy, and balanced with the hops. But, I agree with a couple other reviews, this beer has a strange and not pleasant finish  a kinda funky, bready, almost reminding me of an old stale lager. Maybe just my taste, but I only had 2 pints and switched to something else.
"Split with kchophead, poured from a 12 oz bottle into two pint glasses in equal portions.		Appearance: Pitch Black with a thin brown head. It left a nice lacing. Very nice looking beer.		The smell was bourbon, and more bourbon followed by some vanilla and roasted notes. 		Taste followed nose closely. I know this is supposed to have coffee and chocolate but I just didn't get a lot of it. I'm sure it was there, but they were faint whispers compared to the bourbon's shouting. Vanilla was also prominent. 		Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Light carbonation, but just right for a stout. The alchohol burns going down, but in a good way.		Drinkability certainly takes a hit due to the alchohol. I'll agree with the comments here that say this was like drinking liquor as much as beer in some ways due to the heavy bourbon flavors and the strong alchohol presence.		This was my first BA top 10 beer and I figured it was as good a beer as any to do my first BA review. It was really good, and very unique, but it made me really want to try the regular breakfast stout as the bourbon presence in this beer was so strong that I can barely fathom what it would be like if it were missing."
"Dark amber, nearly brown. Clear. Good head that leaves some spotty lace.		Initially, I detected wet cardboard. Mild alcohol aroma. I cannot detect any darker grains.		This is clearly a flawed version...like a home-brew gone bad. It is missing all of the classic flavors and in their place is an off taste that is reminiscent of laundry water. The body is okay.		I'm curious if this was from a flawed batched. I am reminded of my failed attempt at a cream ale."
".5L, best before 10/14/11. 		Has a lovely pour. Very dark, nearly opaque brown with a fantastic light tan head. Very creamy and thick, with great lacing.		The aroma is muffled, though there's some nutty, toasted malts.		The flavor falls a bit flat, but there's nothing overtly wrong. The sugar or sweetener used in the brewing process does not add too much sweetness, on the contrary, this beer is fairly dry. There's some toasted, near roasty malts and a woody character. The finish reveals some oxidation. The mouthfeel is smooth and not too carbonated.		Decent amount of flavor for the lightness (3.8% ABV) of this beer, but there's much better Schwarzbier to be had."
"Got a 200 ml bottle as a souvenir from a friend's trip to Toronto (thanks johsman). Poured it into a tulip glass and was shocked to see no carbonation at all. It looked like iced tea. The smell was of pure malt and not much else. The taste was interesting, had a raisin-like flavor to it. Reminded me of Raison d'Etre except with no body. Not sure where the 15% alcohol is hiding, couldn't sense it all. This is more of a novelty beer than anything else. Not a great example of an ""American"" strong ale from a Canadian brewery."
"Had it at the brewery during the West Michigan Pub Crawl. 		Pours a nice deep amber in the glass. Smells of hops. Lots of hops. Can't really pick one out, it's not just Centennial or just one hop. You can tell that there is a ton going on in this beer. Taste gets muddled. There's a touch of Malts here, but then there's the confusion of the hops. There's a hint of grapefruit/ citruis from Cascade/Centennial here, but there's also the earthiness from Fuggles, I'm guessing, and some floral hits as well. The problem I have is that it's not well put together. It's just a bunch of hops thrown together. Mouthfeel is thick and lush. I had a problem drinking my one pint of this, I doubt I'd look for it again."
What more really needs to be said about this beer? Obviously nobody here at BA reads this really wondering if Amstel is a decent beer or not. We all know it isn't. It is boring, bland but apparently pleases the masses. It doesn't necessarily offend, but my one complaint is the premium price you sometimes see it for. Why pay for this when there are so many crafts available for about the same price or maybe $1 for a sixer more - and infinitely more enjoyable. Hopefully more of the masses will catch on to that reality soon.
"A- Poured black as night with a frothy tan colored head that receeds to nothing. Very little laces lines the glass.		S- Rich and pungent and not impressed. I had high hopes for this brew but am utterly disappointed. Fruity...somehow...were is the bourbon		T- Rich again and rather overpowering the consistency. Chocolaty and Malty with huge absence of hops....were is the bourbon		M- Minimal carbonation and very thin were is the bourbon		D- Mehh... I'll finish this one...a let down"
"This seemed like an interesting idea, and under other circumstances it might be pretty good. However, this is not good. It looks normal enough despite slight murkiness due to more-than-usual sediment. Distinct aroma of cherries and chocolate dominate which is rather interesting. Downhill from here though; very artificial flavors, totally off-putting and unenjoyable. Old lady holloween candy melted down and cut with a dose of cherry NyQuil and farts. They've been trying to move this stuff for $2.99/sixer at a local place and it's been slow going. I know why."
Pours a deep brownish black color with a thick tan head and a little lacing. Smells of tons of malts and a little coffee. Tastes like a malt bomb. Nothing else. Mouthfeel is medium and it has a good carbonation. Drinkability is less than average because the flavor is so bad.
The aroma is about what a lager should be which for me isn't that special. But it does have grassy and herbal hops as well as a corn like malt. The appearance is pale gold with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma but much hoppier than many lagers. The palate is thin but right for the style. Overall I just don't love the taste but otherwise this is a good example of an American craft lager.
"As a rule I would not even consider a non-alcohol or in this case a low alcohol beer as one to sample, but it was recommended by a friend who is quite well versed in beer, he says its quite drinkable, so lets see.		The color on the pour a transpicuous deep ruby color with a modest in size creamy head that is light tan in color. Lace is a fine sheet to cover the glass. Nose is sweet malt, clean and fresh, start is cloyingly sweet, malt adequate, top is quite thin. Finish is mildly acidic, the hops very mild, quite dry, it is drinkable, and maybe something for when you not able to drink Real Beer."
"Thanks, I think, to my brother in law for bringing me some beer from Lexington on his last visit.	Pours apple juice in color with a bubbly head that recedes very rapidly. Smell is very lager like. Somewhat skunky and biscuity. Taste is very thin, light with almost no flavor whatsoever. This is colored water with carbonation. No beer flavors to be had at all. Not sure what the point of this beer is, but with a name like Horse Piss, they couldn't have been too serious about it."
"Appearance: The best part of this beer. The color is a lovely brown with hints of copper around the edges.		Smell: Like sticking your head in a bourbon barrel. I couldn't detect any malt at all.		Taste: Like being drowned in a bourbon barrel. It overpowers everything. I could not taste any malt, peat or caramel.		Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is thin and watery, adding to the feeling of drinking a big glass of watered down bourbon.		Overall: The bourbon is overpowering. I suspect that if you have bottles and age it for a year or two it'll taste great but it is not good fresh. I love Founder's beers and was excited to finally get to try something other than the breakfast stout. I am, however, very much disappointed. Beer should taste like beer. If I wanted a glass of bourbon, I would have purchased a glass of bourbon."
I'm only reviewing this because my parents had some friends over a couple weeks ago and they left some beers behind in my aging fridge that I leave at their house, because they don't drink. This beer poured watery and had a billowing white head that took about two minutes to fade before lacing the glass. It is the palest of yellow, actually kind of looks urine. It isn't skunked but smells as if it is. Horrible smell. The taste is weak and somewhat metallic. I only gave it a 1.5 because it isn't the worst beer I've ever had. The mouthfeel is watery and ultra light, pretty flat really. This beer is awful. I don't even know why they make beers that're 3.5%, it's only for show.
"Thanks to zimmerbloke for yet another mid-west treat. I've been a fan of Founders since my first sip of Red's Rye PA. This beer landed on my wants list within about a day of the first review popping up. Poured into a pair of Duvel tulips and shared with my wife. 		Appearance is purple-black with burgundy edges. Machiatto like head dissipates to a broken wispy cap and leaves spotty lacing all over. This is my first ""Black Barleywine"" and I gave to say it looks a OK. 		The smell has a little of the wet cardboard oxidized aroma more typical with aged beers. Other than that, sweet fruity hops, ETOH, and a little raisin exists in the aroma. To be honest I don't really find it all that pleasant. 		Big bitter finish follows the sweet roasty alcohol bomb. I am likening this to a big malty East-coast/Third-coast IPA. Not. A. Fan. 		Thin, sticky, and lowly carbonated. Feels about right. 		Not high on the drinkability here. Half a bottle is more than enough. I must say that this is the first miss for me coming from Founders. I'll be ISO next years Nemesis, but this vintage won't be on my radar any longer. Not recommended."
"Re-tasting a popular lager here for review.	 	Pours a pale gold with ample foam, but the aroma is off-putting. 		Skunkiness for sure. 		Heineken fans, take note.		The flavor is watery and insubstantial, with no lingering flavors or complexity. As an associate once said, ""beer-flavored water""."
Pours a clear gold with a thin heaad that disappears quickly. The aroma is floral with hints of caramel and dough. The flavor is spicy caramel with mild malt sweetness and strong hop bitterness but not overwhelming. It's mouthfeel is mediumn, dry and refreshing. Founders Pale Ale is a decent beer, recommended.
Not the greatest tasting malt beverage but it can surely deal you a quick buzz. Tastes like rubbing alcohol with a slight hint of grain. Pours out in a slick pale amber color, mild carbonation and little taste of good old American hops. Slides down the throat easy enough, as do most malt liquors, but the lack of good beer taste damages this one's appeal
Pours a clear golden color. 1/4 inch head with decent retention and decent lacing. Smells strongly of strawberry (overpowers other aromas). I guess it fits the style of an American Pale Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with high carbonation levels present. A very strong tartness is the most noticeable aspect of this beer. Tastes of strawberry flavoring, some tart malt, along with a unpleasing dryness left on the palate. This was hard to drink because of the overpowering tartness.
"Clear, bronzy-coppery brown in hue; minor off-white head, at the apex the foam was only a half finger tall. The bubbles quickly faded to a soapy collar. Subsequent lacing was very spotty. Overall, the appearance is decent but hardly noteworthy.		The nose is malty sweet with hints of caramel butter nut popcorn. It is also somewhat earthy with a smattering of fruitiness as well; not much in the way of hops ESB, eh? I am underwhelmed by the nose. Maybe I am an ugly American but there is nothing in the aroma to get excited about let alone motivate me to take a sip. Moderately low potency; bland.		Slightly metallic caramel butter flavor with some nuts in the background, hints of toffee with a fairly dry finish. Moderate bitterness in the middle; not much fruitiness either, hints of wood but there is little complexity overall. Popcorn flavors in the finish with a faint metallic and butter twang; the aftertaste is of dead vegetables (and after a few drinks this taste becomes overwhelming). Sadly, the palate is doing nothing for me.		Almost medium in body, low carbonation but not unnaturally so; the mouthfeel is average.		Limited drinkability; this is yet another English ale that fails to deliver. If this is one of the best beers in England then, um, wow. Maybe I got a bad bottle (I dont think so as my girlfriend, another beer geek, liked it quite a bit). Nevertheless, thank you Howard and Lynne for bringing this back from England for me. 		Best by: 24 Jun 08"
"Couch surfin' with the irrepressible milwaukeeclassic		22 oz bottle decanted into two eager snifters. Deep dark chocolate colored pour with a mocha colored head that dissipates towards the edges.		Holy SWEET Jesus...Boozy, bit of dark chocolate, leafy hops, and did I mention the booziness? Nostrilical follicles are sufficiently fried.		Very hoppy, quite bitter and dry with some coffee mate, chocolate, and plastic. There is a strange chemical quality here that keeps this from being particularly enjoyable. I had higher hopes for this. I can sense the headache coming as this beer becomes a chore to finish."
"A. Poured an clear amber, with a two finger white frothy head, Some lacing on the glass.		S. Barley, corn, cereal. More malt than hops.		T. Sweet malty up front, maple sweetness, some earthy tones and a decent amount of hops. Not as much hops as I like for an Ipa, but decent nonetheless.		M. Medium bodied light carbonation, decent duration.		O. A decent brew. The brew was a little too sweet and bnot bitter enough for the style."
"First off, I'd like to say this beer has me excited but also scared as shit! A very intense style, if not the most intense beer style.		Dark deep amber tobacco color into the glass with excellent head retention. Sticking everywhere! 		Holy shit, smells like a smokehouse where a shit ton of pork is being roasted over wood fires. This is intense! Puts a smile on my face.		Roasted toasted bacon, smokehouse smoke with some smoke sauce over smoke. Jesus, this is insane.		Could not finish the bottle - just too intense for me, as this is my first true smoke beer. I will be sure to revisit this one after acquiring a taste for rauchbiers.		Picked this up at total wine for about $4."
Balanced taste / palate until a real alcohol-fueled kick at the end. A very bitter finish - quite pleasant, if that's what you're looking for - but a much boozier taste than I'd expected. At 9.4%, alcohol flavour is to be expected, and without the (super) sweetness of many barley wines. Something to enjoy on occasion, but definitely not a session beer.
"After getting by the nauseating name, here it goes:		It pours out a pale pale pale straw color, with some low-density white head that dissipates quickly. Weak malty aroma. Quite pathetic upon tasting, as a bit of ""beer-like flavor"" hits the palate and vanishes, and then a faint bit of hops finishes it. It's watery in the mouth, and the carbonation is a little irritating. Overall, the aftertaste is a little gross, and I'll be able to drink this one bottle but I don't want anymore. The end."
"Poured from a 24oz can into a pint glass.		Appearance/Smell - Appears pale gold/yellow with high carbonation, no lacing, and no head. Smells of very sweet malt with metallic alcoholic notes. Some tart grape, some corn, mostly an over powering metallic alcoholic aroma. Very unpleasant, and as it warms it only gets worse.		Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of very sweet malt, hints of corn, and a very pronounced metal alcoholic flavor. Sweet stale hop like aftertaste, a little citrus notes as well. As it warms, metallic/alcoholic flavor only gets worse. Mouthfeel is smooth, a little bitey from the carbonation, and has a lite-medium body.		Drinkability/Final thoughts - This Malt Liquor is not drinkable at all. I would only be able to drink 1-2 24oz cans of this, ice cold and shotgunning it.Even so, I don't think ill be buying this beer again. I just couldn't get over the extremely overpowering flavor & smell of metal & alcohol. Save your money folks, there are allot of other easy to drink Malt liquors out there.		For me, there has to be some kind of pleasure in drinking the beer. Serving it nearly frozen to mask flavor and smell, then shotgunning it, doesn't cut it for me. Id like to know the beer I'm drinking is actually reasonable, and drinkable. Not recommended, try another Malt Liquor to get messed up on."
12 oz. bottle- color of honey yellow , with a thin white color head - nose of sweet corn ( white , yellow) , milk thistle , and metallic  watery taste of corn , rice , and soapy  body is watery , and lightly carbonated  light aftertaste of melon , and sweet corn
"Consumed at brewery on Saturday, November 5th 2011.		Appearance - cloudy, medium yellow, minimal white head.		Aroma - raspberries. Surprise!		Flavor - slightly sour, strong and sweet raspberry flavor, slight tartness. All other flavors absent.		Mouthfeel - average for a light beer style.		Drinkability - Ack. This stuff is pretty bad. I believe the sour and tart edge to the flavor was an unintentional by product of infection as opposed to an intended lambic-style flavor."
22oz bottle purchased at LCBO in Toronto for around $5. Best before date of January 2008. Bottle explodes upon opening and spills all over the counter and floor. Good first impression. All I had done was move it from being on its side to upright five minutes prior. Beer on the floor and counter is poor appearance, thus the low rating there. When I finally do get to pour it, it's fizzy and black. Aroma is not very smoky or stoutish and gives a hint of what is about to come. And that is sourness. The sourness dominates the palate and makes you wonder if a different style of beer was put in the bottle. This is not a good stout. But I seem to recall sampling this at the 2007 Golden Tap Awards at beerbistro, and it was just fine. Trafalgar's quality issues continue.
"this beer looked great: lightly golden, with streams of carbonation rising from the foot of the glass and disappearing into the fluffy white head.		the aroma was all leafy hops, powerful but not astringent. 		the flavor was a huge letdown for me. from what i had read of this beer, i was expecting a huge wave of bitterness followed by delicate, bready malt flavors. instead, i got a weak slap of leafy bitterness, followed by ... nothing. like drinking water that tastes like tired hops for the first second it's in your mouth. one of the most flavorless beers i've ever tasted. a real waste of four bucks. 		thin mouthfeel, appropriate for the style, i suppose, but nothing that makes up for the utter lack of character. 		barely drinkable. i hope and pray that i got an uncharacteristically bad bottle. 		cheers,		s.d."
Color is a typical amber-gold, not much head. Smell is fairly substantial and malty. Flavor is malty and pleasant, not complex, a little watery but still palatable. For a light beer, this actually tastes pretty good - considerably better than any other light beer I've ever had. At least one feels as though one is drinking beer and not beer-flavored water!
"My parents brought this back from Aruba for me. 		Lager gold color with a decent white chapeau. No lace, no retention, not much to look at. It does come in a cute little bottle though. Dated 2/12/11.		Smells like grass and wet hay. There's a little but of hop snap in there. Taste is...vapid? Doesn't really have any malt character, I just get a slick and slimy mouthfeel. Balashi calls it Euro moutheel - poor Europe. Subtle hop spice is the one redeeming quality here. The fact that this beer won 2 gold medals further supports my theory that at some point, any crap in a bottle has won something. 		Overall Impression: Well, at least I crossed Aruba off the list."
"Part of the CanBIF 5 package that I received from wfeddern, thanks!		From a 341 ml brown bottle, silver foil around the cap. Pours out a hazed transluscent amber, slight white head that settles very quickly.		Aroma has a sweet wort character, some sweet caramel, a bit of veg, some earthy notes.		Falls down flat in the flavour department, worty sweetness up front, veg on the finish, with a spicy, smokey aftertaste that lingers.		Speaking of flat, that sums up the profile of the mouthfeel as well, however with a bit of a carbonation bite on the finish.		Well, I can't say I'd be going back for more if this was available locally. Judging from previous scores I'm not off the mark for consistency regarding this cream ale, so I can't even chalk it up to a bad bottle. This one is just best avoided."
"Pours a ...Whoa, we got a gusher, tons of foam. Dark black body with an enourmous tan head, great retention. Smells of oak, earthiness, Brett like funk, some chocolate and coffee, soft citrus fruits. Tastes of semi-sweet coffee and chocolate like malt with a fairly strong undertone of oak. Touch of citrus fruit and sourness. Bitterness is fairly moderate leading to a chocolate like dryness. Carbonation way too high for this style.		Overall, pretty disappointed, definitely infected. It almost smelled like a lambic for gods sake. Too bad, this could have been a very promising beer, but the excess carbonation really messes with all the flavors in this beer. I hope Pike is more careful in the future, i definitely won't be buying from them for a while."
"A - Three fingers of frothy yet fast disappearing white head. Clear and bubbly, golden amber in colour.		S - Some floral sweetness, a bit skunky.		T - Just very mild in every way. Low sweet malt with some lemon juice.		M - Watery thin, with moderate carbonation levels. Mild bitter finish.		O - As with any crap beer, it gets worse as it warms but as long as this is cold it is drinkable."
"Beer can (50cl.), tasted in 2006.		Appearance : a yellow color, with white foam head (not persistent).	Smell : no significant aromas.	Taste and mouthfeel : sweet, with no signficant taste	Drinkability : a very bad example of Pale lager (ABV 4.1%) brewed by Coors."
"Got this bottle at a local offie in East End London at just 1 quid, for it had already expired by three months. BB 05/05/06, served chilled in a pint-sized weizen glass.		A: very pale straw in colour, coming with a fluffy and cottony white beer head with good retention; the carbonation is moderate and constant, not harsh or violent-looking.	S: an astringent eggy, cardboard-paper, and sulphury note ""screams"" out of the bottle as soon as it was opened... dissipating fast, thankfully; slightly doughy and mildly grainy lager malts upfront, slightly eggy at the back; very faint presence of hops, but overall not unpleasant or overly thin.	T: a very faint flavour of lager malts makes a very quiet entrance... quickly joined by a faintly grainy taste, clean-textured lemony fruits, a touch of grassy hops as well as ""taste-less"" hoppy input in the form of bitterness in the end. No unwanted metallic, sugary or sticky adjunct flavour in the finish, yet no nothing else either...!	M&D: with hardly anything to pick up on the palate, this is a ""minimalist"", medium-minus bodied pale lager (is it because the beer has way expired??); yet the texture is crafted to a clean and crisp condition, with a well-made fizzy body. Not a beer to taste, but to quaff with food, I reckon. For that purpose, this beer is quite alright."
Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a nice dark foamy head with average retention. Coffee aroma is quite overpowering with some subtle roasted malt. Taste is totally overpowered by coffee and as much as I like some coffee characteristic in my stout I cannot drink coffee. Total lack of balance or complexity, just an overpowering of coffee. Definitely not one for me.
"2007 vintage. 1pint 6fl oz bottle poured into my snifter		Pours a light brown to slightly light murky amber color. Slightly tan 2 inch head. The head is very bubbly and frothy. Great head retention that last throughout the beer leaving behind sticky lacing clinging to the sides of my glass.		Huge malt smell is what comes out of this beer. Huge toffee and caramel malt smell dominate with hints of raisins, figs, and black licorice coming in behind. Talk about a huge malt smell!!!		Sweet toffee and candy sugar taste upfront with a hint of hop bitterness coming in the end. 		Full bodied with a slightly high carbonation and a dry sweet aftertaste that lingers in your mouth.		Too sweet for my liking."
"750ml bottle thanks to G311.		Pours cloudy amber in color with a small off-white head that fades.		Aroma is sweet and malty with iced tea and citrusy, herbal, and resinous hops.		The flavor is a like a hard iced tea mixed with an imperial IPA. Sweet caramel malt with loads of grapefruit, resin, and herbal hop notes.		Full-bodied and syrupy with fairly low carbonation.		A little disappointing overall. I wouldn't say it's below average for the style, but I wouldn't say it's much above average either. Not so easy to drink."
"650 ml bottle from the LCBO. These new labels are abysmal.		Pours a clear dark red, some brownish highlights, pretty thick and foamy light tan head forms, quickly settles down to a thin ring around the glass, no lace spots. Smell is very sweet and malty, caramel, some bread, dark fruit, almost a bit of spiciness, cherries and strawberries, a bit medicinal, brown sugar, not good but not as bad as most Trafalgar. Taste is very weak in the flavour, some brown sugar and a bit of caramel, very bready, weird kind of rotten fruit flavour, some spice, almost a banana flavour, but very watery, almost nothing there. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, almost feels a bit syrupy, low to medium carbonation, not awful but certainly not good at all, pretty tough to drink. Not a whole lot of incentive to finish this bottle."
Cask-Round House, Covent Garden, London. Pretty simple, grainy cask ale. Pretty light, fresh and summery, and slightly floral nose, with little character, skullable, typical low ABV English summer blonde, perhaps this is on the blander side of the scale however.
"Clear copper color with a thin head that quickly disipated. Just light lacing is left on the glass.		Malty aroma with hints of caramel and yeast. Not much for hops.		They should call this an amber ale. Sweet caramel malt with very little hop charactor. Some grassy hops. Bitterness is low.		A little on the undercarbonated side. Too bad as the body does pocess some depth.		The brewer mislabeled their beer. An average amber ale."
Was not impressed with this beer. It poured a nice yellow hue with hardly any foam at all. The taste was not all that impressive and I personally think that this beer was over aged. It had a flat and listless taste with a hint of sour on the tongue!
Not impressed. No aroma. Almost no flavor, but it has some malty character - cold enough, its slightly refreshing drink with some chips. After two of them, I was so sick of the taste I had to order a Dos Equis! Not the worst beer I ever had, but pretty terrible. Just an annoying bland taste and not really any redeeming qualities.
"A- Thin tan head that fades fast. Cloudy red/brown body.	S- Sweet toffee malts, light fruits, alcohol, some grapes, and a few things I just can't put my finger on.	T- Really sweet tasting toffee. Alcohol comes in strong with some light spices, fruits, grapes, and just this strong bad flavor I can't seem to narrow down. Alcohol warms up back of throat.	M- Medium body with low/medium carbonation.	D- This is just a bad beer. Bad flavors and just a bad blend of flavors."
"Picked up a ""secret"" stash of this at Bourbon & Canal. $21 for a quad.		Poured into my Bruery tulip. Pours a dark hazy burnt-amber with a bunch of floaties in there (I love those). A half-inch head appears after a forced pour, but quickly settles to a thin off-white lid on the top of my beer. No lacing on the glass.		Gotta admit that I don't have a lot of experience in the wheatwine arena...really just Oatgoop, other than this one. But this was a lot different than the Three Floyds version. The first smell I picked up was a sweet berry - strawberries, actually. Really, it smells a lot like that old drink ""Big Red"" used to taste...do they even make that stuff anymore? A bubble-gum like berry smell. Also some vanilla in there and a strong alcohol sting as I get my nose down into my glass. This is definitely different - but I like it!		Definitely a taste that isn't overly common. Initially I got a heavy smack of vanilla. Cream Soda like...to the point that it dominated every drink I took. Thick, creamy, heavy mouthfeel. Very sweet with some maple/vanilla attributes. Heavy grainy swallow that was very warming. A strong alcoholic burn rounds this thing out. Too much, really - it is a stinging ""hot"" that really hits you at the end of the drink. I'm not sure how these things age, but it really feels like a few years would smooth this out. I'm a bit turned off by the finish.		I really enjoyed the opportunity to try this beer. I think Founder's does an outstanding job with about anything they do, and this was no different. Although it is a bit too stiff on the bourbon, it pushes the envelope...I hope it gets better with some time on it. This was not a beer that I could drink in quantity, but a unique experience. 		Consumed: 2/17/2010"
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a dark brown color, with a 1/2 inch head that dissipates and leaves no cap. The smell is quite overpowering with cinnamon, ginger, and caramel. The taste is a kick in the face! Not sure I think taking the Belgian style brew is a good match for a spiced brew. I have had a number of extremely well crafted Belgian beers and none have had even a hint of ""winter spices"". The style is strong on it's own. This was just too much to handle. Need to go back to the drawing board Oso! 		As of late I am coming to find the brews from this new establishment are mediocre at best. I think more tasting needs to go into the final products that are reaching the shelves, especially with this higher cost to purchase."
Pours a cider like color with a very slight head. The aroma is of chocolate and cherries with a little sweetness to it. The taste is like chocolate covered cherries, it is very unique, its not refreshing but it is interesting and enjoyable. The mouthfeel is a little thin and with a slight carbonation. The drinkability is not that high, i can't see you sitting there and crushing a six pack of these, but you could have one or two for a dessert. Its a sweet tasting beer, with a unique take, it is for sure worth a try.
"16.9 oz heavy duty brown bottle. Clear freshness dating which I always like to see on imports. 		The beer pours a nice bright gold with a huge initial head. Decent lacing 		Nice smell of grains, malts and some floral hops. No off aromas at all.		The taste is slightly sweet and a bit metallic. The beer tastes a little washed out with some graininess coming on  way through. The hops seem to disappear. This is a very, very mild tasting beer. Seems slightly off.		The beer is a bit under carbonated for the style. Still it has a solid feel to it. Drinkabity suffers a bit from the unassertive taste profile. Im pretty under whelmed by this one. Probably the weakest of any Czech beer I have had. .99 at Sals Liquors in Elmhurst."
"Sampled on tap at Tyler's in Apex, NC.		Golden with good clarity and a large white head. The aroma is crisp and fruity but a bit empty. My wife thought it smelled like a Bud. The flavor is pretty ordinary and bland with bread and a hint of fruit. It tasted pretty stale to me. It's got a moderate consistency and a low to moderate carbonation.		I regretted ordering this one. This beer doesn't do justice to the group it attempts to honor."
Bottle and tap. Had lots of hype on this one and it certainly disapointed to say the least. Aroma: Overpowering fruity hops, light cherries, Onions(!), ughh. If it wasnt for the onions, it would have been OK. Appearance: Copper pour with small head. Flavor: Lots of fruity hops again, but unfortunately the alcohol is not hidden at all and takes all the place. Lots of sweetness also. Palate: Rich and heavy, lots of alcohol. Overall: Could not finish half the bottle. It wasnt so bad on tap though, but the alcohol was overpowering. I can't believe this is so highly rated.
The deep dark heavy amber color lends hope that this beer will be much more flavorful than the others at the pub, but no luck.  The yeasty lager character and Northern Brewer hops which give a steam beer its trademark flavor is light enough in this beer to warrant giving it the boot.
"This was my first smoked beer to review and I must say that is not a favorite class for me. The poor review is more a reflection of the dislike of the class than the quality of beer itself.		A. A deep amber color with a healthy head. The head dissipates while leaving good lacing.		S. Like liquid smoke. Burnt malt. 		T. Wow, hard to handle. like licking a smoked porkchop.		M. Except for the taste not bad.		D. Not great. However, over in Germany is was often said that you must have more than one. Follow the first with a shot of schnapps and then it gets better."
"First of all, I don't know if Founders decided to change the recipe of Red's Rye beer into Red's Rye P.A., or if it is just a name change. But I searched for Red's Rye P.A. and didn't find it, so I'm adding it now. The label reads, ""Hopped-up Ale brewed with Rye.""		Poured a dark-reddish amber with an off white head. I couldn't smell any aroma when I tried this beer. Medium bodied, caramel malt flavor and no distinguishable hop aftertaste, not good for something that is supposed to have an IPA characteristic. It was not balanced, malts dominated and there was a strong alcohol taste. Overall this one missed the mark."
"www.duff-bier.de or www.duff-bier.com		Found this beer in Rome at a tourist shop. It's brewed by a contract company: Eschweger Klosterbrauerei. I wrote to Duff to check where all it's sold, they where very tight lipped about it and said it was for trade only in Germany. Now I know I saw it in three different shops in Italy so...I don't know. Almost denying it's very existence anywhere else.		Pours a clear golden color just like all the other pils beers out there.		Smell is faint corn.		Taste kind of grassy and very watery extremely disappointed considering it's a German beer and has legendary in the title. I'm guessing it's brewed more as a joke. Either way I wish they had done more with this, it really isn't very good.		I would drink this again if only to say I'm drinking Duff. It really could be much better and it's 3.50 euro per bottle, not worth it, have a Stella Artois instead."
"On-tap at Pacific Coast		A: The pour is amber in color, not surprisingly, with a decent khaki colored head.		S: Not a very pleasant aroma, I must say. There's definitely some sweetness, which is the nicest thing I can say about this beer. There's some sweaty butt crack aroma and quite a bit of alcohol as well.		T: At least this doesn't taste like ass crack (at least, I don't think it does). Decently bitter with some grapefruit juice but also some cleaning solution (maybe lemon pledge?). A bit of toffee malt flavor, too.		M: The body is medium and so is the carbonation.		D: Just bad. I had thought that the Grey Whale and Megalodon were the bottom of the barrel, but this is certainly in the running."
"A- Pale yellow, but a decent head that lasts longer than expected.		S- Light grain and straw. Not something I wanted to smell enough to find anything else in there.		T- Damp straw. Corn. Nothingness.		M- Thin, watery.		D- Just bleh overall. Part of a mix 6, so I don't feel too bad. Not something that tastes bad enough(or at least not present enough) to recoil from, but I'll never buy again."
"Pours thick and brown with a little bit of clarity; the head is small to nonexistent. As soon as this beer was opened, the entire apartment started to smell like smoked sausage, smoked ham, smoked bacon, and pretty much every other smoked meat in existence. If I really stick my nose in the glass (and God, is that a horrible thought), I can make out some roasted malts.		Tastes exactly like it smells, massive, overwhelming smokiness with some roasted malt character. German hops show up late-palate as a lingering bitterness that balances out the smokiness. Mouthfeel is comparable to road tar.		I actually liked this beer-- for the first four sips. I could even imagine it pairing reasonably well with a (non-smoked) meat.		Somewhere there is probably an old German man who puts away six of these with dinner. He is a much, much bigger man than me."
Big thanks to grownfool for sending me this as part of a recent trade. This was definitely smoky and I hate to say this but there is something about rauch/smoked beers that is similar to wet dog! Cheap beef jerky too. Band aids almost. The flavor is a little bit of chocolate then some smoky, rubbery flavors. I'm sorry but I cannot fuck with smoked beers (yet).
"22 oz bottle split and poured into a Duvel tulip. 10% ABV, 94 OG, 22.5 degrees Plato, ""High IBUs""		Big old thanks to Beerwolf77 for ending a reallly long tasting with a face-melting IPA.		A - So much sediment in suspension, it's more populated than the stars in a dark night sky. Golden hued amber with a two-finger off-white head with moderate retention and tons of lace.		S - Rich pine-needle with grapefruit citrus so fresh it could have just been squeezed out into the beer. A lot of resin equivalent to opening a new action figure. Tons of back-up malts with a bold melted caramel chunk.		T - So much resiny pine it's almost ridiculous. It's like sap from a pine tree it's so rich tasting and powerful. So much grapefruit too, it can't get any fresher. Bitter beyond belief. Oy vey.		M - Hot Hop Damn this is just out-of-control. The hop level is close to insane and bitter as hell. This is one tongue-shredding brew that makes my teeth hurt.		D - A 22 needs to be split at LEAST 2 ways, if not 3 to be on in the drinkability category. It's so potent, if there were a Triple IPA category, this would be a main contender."
Poured a honey orange color with a thin white head. Nose was honey-like sweetness. Taste was a grainy with English malts mixed with some honey and a little bit of hops. It was pretty bland and not that good overall. I would not drink again. Many b etter English Pales out there.
"12oz bottle picked up on a recent trip to kentucky. drank from my duvel tulip.		A- this one pours out a murky looking reddish brown colored body with a small beige head on it. the head lasts for a while before receding, and leaves behind a few randomly placed spots of lacing. 		S- belgian yeast is the first thing that i notice. after that comes a myriad of fruits. apples, pears, plums, cherries, and a little bit of orange. interesting. some bubblegum/banana in here also.		T- the taste isnt nearly as inviting as the smell, and is kind of a let down. the fruits are in here, but alot less pronounced. the yeast is the main contributor to the flavor, offering a bit of banana and bubble gum. 		M- thin and watery. highly carbonated. 		D- after the smell this one sort of fell apart on me. i dont think id seek it out again."
"Thanks to chonyr for bringing this 650ml bomber back to NWO.		Appearance	Looks much like it should, pouring a clear, coppery brown ale. Not much head however, and also not laced. Slightly more than barely carbonated.		Aroma	Not much going on for aroma either. Slightly cheesy (mozzarella?) with hints of cough syrup.		Taste	More going on here, but the flavour of mozzarella cheese almost dominates the almost pleasant biscuit and nut malts flavours. A hint of adjunct grain corniness also present. Some fruity esters also present, with hints of apple and dark grape. Finishes in earthy and woody hop bitterness with some floral and fruity character. The almost pleasant hop contribution is marred by its lingering medicinal character, and combines with the esters present in a way thats reminiscent of cough syrup.		Mouthfeel	Light to medium in body, dry finishing and mildly astringent. Malts and hops balanced according to style, but yeast cheesiness wont let go, and due to the sum of its parts the hop finish blends into a medicinal mess that suppresses cough and loosens phlegm.		Drinkability	Much more drinkable and sessionable than Robitussin. Likely best paired with something even more cheesy, like pizza or lasagna, to numb one to its own inherent cheesiness. Not a good example of the style thanks mainly to the off yeast flavours. Can finally see where pootz is coming from with his disdain for Trafalgar."
"A crystal clear pale yellow with a fizzy head on top that is clean white and fades quickly. Leaves a few rings of lacing however. Kind of a BMC look I guess.		The nose is extremely faint. All I am really picking up is some light graininess, but that is all.		The taste is extremely weak. Again, some light grain and actually a touch of bitter hops in there. A very safe and boring flavor that reminds me of BMC. 		Pretty thin and watery feeling. Dry as well.		This one really does nothing for me. I hope Fulton does well and I enjoyed the Sweet Child, but I have no need to ever try this one again."
"L:bright white tiny little bubbles that disappear quickly. Bright clear orange color.	S:On first smell I pick up a bready bisquity. roasted nuts follow with a malty sweetness. An odd bubblegum grapefruit lingers.	T:That bubble gum grapefruit comes out immediately. Really pungent sweetness. A slight brown bisquit.	M:The mouth feel was a nice round softness.	D:Odd. That bubble gum flavor I pick up is slightly off putting. I am a huge fan of DIPA's and this one just did not do it for me"
"Poured into a beer mug. It had a hazy yellow color with a nice size head. It smelled of honey, grain, malt. It tasted of slight wheat, honey, and a lemon citrus finish. It was a light beer, definitely refreshing. Overall all I have to say is yikes, BA members,your palate is really bad including the bros. there is nothing German about this beer, there is nothing ""Helles Lager"" stylish about this beer. Spicy hop Bitterness is no wheres to be found."
"Second time around on this choice. First time was strictly experimental, all that really was skull instated was the alcohol aftermath. Should gather that from the bold black labeling.		Now onto the Mocne.	Pour is a pillowy off-white, holds really well. Body is rich gold, Big plus +. Lacing separates into segmented levels, not rounding the glass, just at quarters. Cap holds firm with little breaks.		Dropping my nose over and then into the glass are a few things jutting from that. One, the alcohol %, very spirits like. Sweetness of a toasted malt, be still, maybe light caramel. 		At the front is an annoying spark of carbonation like dragging your socks on a rug before the door knob. Alcohol resinates pretty much as overpowering the soft sweetness. In the mid of this experience is a pronounced smoked meaty flavour and aroma. Bitterness is actually tolerable and smooth, some metallic too. There is like a geranium floral to this as well. Alcohol again hogs the upstage. In finishing, a touch of orange is in the background adjacent to a wet straw aftermath. Drop the % by 2 and we'll be friends.		Even though this was like sippin' barrel, I still think it has it's place alongside a game meat like moose (Yum) or wild mule deer. Make sure the gravy has lots of Marjoram. MMMM"
"Appearance: A hard pour barely raises a head to rest atop the clear amber liquid but what does raise lingers as a film and provides a few lacing dots		Smell: Bready malts with a distinct grainy aspect; butterscotch is detected underneath		Taste: Bready, up front, with the butterscotch (diacetyl) joining the grainy flavors by mid-palate; a bit of apple tartness appears, as well; after the swallow, the sweeter flavors linger in the finish		Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with low carbonation; somewhat aqueous		Drinkability: Not very impressed by this beer, with the sweeter malt flavors being so dominant and the mouthfeel being so insipid; I suspect this is much better on cask"
"I have to disagree with everyone here.	My experience with this porter was:		A: decent almost black with an incredibly active head of 3 fingers that melted slowly but left no lacing.		S: Faintly roasted, burn malts with a bit of chocolate		T: Very dark roasted malts with some very bitter chocolate and maybe a touch of espresso...unfortunately they all get lost with the intense (read: VERY) carbonation.		M: All tiny carbonation bubbles that foam in the mouth rather than merely tingle and sparkle....carbonation covers everything else.		D: Not again unless I have need to expend major gass."
"Picked up a bottle of this stuff recently and to say the least, its not really fitting whatsoever as a lager.		Appearance is very amber/pallid yellow with absolutely not head whatsoever. Very thin and watery in texture and no carbonation at all. This looks like a very flat beer.		Smell is nonexistent. Maybe some faint whiffs of corn but there's no strong aroma at all with this stuff.		Taste seems underdeveloped and unfinished. While it does have a decent bitter center, it has a metallica taste overall with an unnecessary aftertaste. This is pretty average.		Mouthfeel is watery, thin and nonexistent. All the flavor that this beer provided quickly disappeared. Nothing interesting here.		Drinkability is pretty eh. It's not really a great beer to dive into, but they are cheap. If you're looking for something foreign and cheap, then this is a decent brew, but that's about it."
"This was a Christmas gift from my wife. Shared with MbpBugeye and Ryan011235.		The beer was mostly clear; a deep gilded ruby color. There was a very small cap of cinnamon cream colored head. There was no lace. Mild visible carbonation.		My first impression upon smelling this beer was that I had walked up to a Cinnabon stand at the mall. Lots of spicing - not much different than in the non-BA version. Nutmeg and cinnamon play the dominant role. There was also a mild minty aroma that some of us detected and I even picked up on a little chocolate. I got very little evidence of the barrel aging/whiskey in the aroma apart from meager traces of vanilla.		The flavor was much less pleasing than the aroma was. Certainly, the barrel did manage to smooth out the harsh spiciness of the base beer (though it is still much stronger than in many warmers), but once again, the whiskey barrel aging seemed to have little other effect. I really believe that these were not fresh barrels. 		There was still a ton of dryness from the spices. The beer was slightly hot but not really boozy. Sweet vanilla and cinnamon, and lots of dry oak.		Drinkability is low - this was an expensive brewery only release combined with insane amounts of holiday spicing; the beer just wasn't that amazing. I would rather have this over the non-BA version any day of the week, but there are much better winter warmers out there at a fraction of the price.		My final notes were that the smell was fantastic, but I would have preferred a MUCH larger barrel presence. It was worth a try if you have the disposable income, but I won't be seeking this out again unless I hear that the brewery makes some big changes."
"I really didn't expect too much of this beer going in. The last time I drank a beer from the caribbean it was Red Stripe which I thougth was awful, so my expectations were not too high.		The beer has an average appearance for a pilsner. It has a straw to amber color and is just a little darker (slightly) than Heineken. It is very clear.		The carbonation is towards the high range and does carry a very slight hint of hops aroma.		The taste & mouthfeel are much like that of a macro brew (read ""not much"") and the finish is OK but doesn't really last more than a few seconds.		The bars in Aruba only seem to carry this and the usual macro brews, so you may as well give Balashi a try. Especially since it is very unlikely you will come across Balashi anywhere else."
"The menu stated that Helles Honey Bock is made with 60 lbs. of Iowa wildflower honey and Belgian Munich malt. Clean, golden honey capped by a scant cotton white head that fell in minutes to near nothing and left thin, clingy, ragged sheets of lace. This was the first beer that I've ever had that had no aroma. Question is, how do I rate 'nothing'?		Hideously undermalted, much more so than the ESB that I had prior. HHB was skeletally thin and had a sweet, lightly grain-like flavor that tasted nothing like honey until the finish. Strangely enough, most of the honey beer that I've run across hides the honey flavor until the finish; this one was no exception. 		No hops to speak of and almost no bitterness. The body was anorectic, although it kept its structure throughout, barley avoiding watery. It was also more mineral-like than the ESB; probably due to the lack of hops and the lack of flavor in general.		Helles Honey Bock is not good beer, even by Iowa brewpub standards. In fact, it has too many faults to even attempt a salvage operation. My recommendation to the brewer is to start over and my recommendation to the customer is to order something else."
"Poured into a tumbler.		Pours a clear golden with very little indication this is a cherry beer. Smell on the other hand is nothing but sweet cherries. Cherry pie filling would be the overwhelming aroma. No tartness to be found.		Taste is very much what I expected from the smell, except more grenadine like instead of cherry pie filling. Extremely cloying and difficult to hold in my mouth for very long. Not particularly enjoyable. I have a very difficult time drinking one in a sitting. 		Not sure what Founders was going for here. Shirley Temple flavored beer? The only conclusion I am able to.come up with is that this is an intended mixer to go with other beers. Will mix some with an RIS to see if I can enjoy it that way.		4 pack will last me at least a year."
"Small capped bottle poured int a snifter. 		Peculiar color, a hazy, light orange, with not much of a head, just a very very thin tan covering that dissipates in seconds. 	Aroma is interesting, but quite boozy. Some oak notes, a lot of vanilla, burnt sugar, and again, more alcohol.	Medium bodied, the flavor suffers - a lot - from excessive alcohol heat. Sweet notes get drowned, and what would be a good sweet sipper, feels like low quality spirit. 	I can see some promise, however, and it is still possible that in another two years this will be good. The other bottle goes back to the cellar, for at least two more years.."
"A- An aggressive pour yields a good inch of head to top this lightly hazy, golden beer. A decent amount of lacing stays on the sides of the glass as the head quickly dissipates.		S- Not much here; lightly skunky with coriander and a wheaty twang. 		T- Lightly sour malt upfront with a good dose of coriander adding some flavor along with some grassy hops. Finishes dry and slightly bitter with a lingering coriander aftertaste.		M- Fairly light, almost a little creamy and lightly carbonated.		Pretty mediocre version of the style here. It's about what I've come to expect from Pike's beers, yet they keep enticing me with their shelf of reasonably priced offerings at Total Wine. This one's not terrible, but you can do better, even at its sub-$5.00 price point."
"Bottle picked up at Total Wine in Alexandria. Served in a Bruery tulip.		Pours a moderate copper color with a thin white head that dissipates too quickly and leaves behind only a tad bit of lacing. The nose is faintly reminiscent of the fact that at one point someone might have considered adding a hop cone or two to it. In honesty, there is a very, very, very (enough of those) faint presence of light citrus and herbal hops. Malt is there in a bready form, not really lending anything on its own. The taste echoes the nose, and not in a good way. Finish is ever so slightly dry with moderate carbonation. Not something I would have again."
".5L emptied into a Pokal.		A: Pours golden orange with a soapy 1-finger white head which quickly receeds to a trace ring. No lacing.		S: Sweet bready malt, yeast, cereals, caramel, hint of hops. Within 10 minutes, the smell turns sour.		M: Light bodied with some carbonation.		T: Rather unbalanced malt sweetness mixed with very little hop profile. Grainy malt towards the end. Finish is not crisp. Finally, some spicy hops in the aftertaste, but not much.		D: This is supposed to be a Pilsener? By whose definition? This comes off as a poor example of a Euro Lager. Not sure what to make of this one. I'm just not impressed."
"This is my second review on here, the other one for Alaskan Summer Ale, which has turned out to be one of my favorites. 		This, however, is an exception. I really, TRULY feel there is a general bias on here towards 'colored' beers, i.e., its not often that a decent light-colored beer gets shown any love, even if it's really quite good. This is irritating. 		Case in point, this turd-in-a-bottle. This beer is awful. I mean, really. The only thing I can taste is the soot from my barbecue grill. This is pathetic. Really, this is an awful, crappy beer, and you people should be ashamed of yourselves preferring this over something like Sapporo, which I've actually had in the same night (w/ sushi), and which was FAAAAR preferable. Seriously, I can't seen how on earth something like this has a higher rating on BA. It makes absolutely no sense. 		I agree that Adventinus totally rocks, that Chimay Grande Reserve is an absolute treat. I know beer. And this beer sucks. This beers sucks... A LOT. Really all you can taste is burnt carbon life forms. This is a terrible beer, in virtually ever respect but appearance, which is a cloudy ruby amber, and belies the awfulness of what's to come. 		AVOID. 		God... I'm not finished yet. This is really bad. I mean, it's rare that I have something like a Miller Chill (a thoroughly despicable abortion of a beer) and am actually less affronted by the taste of that than that of this abomination. 		OK, now I'm finished. I feel better now. Well, not much better, because I still have about 14 oz. of this crap left, but I needed to get that out. Thanks for listening, and please head my warning, if you live in the Pac NW."
"Had this on tap a bunch of times and recently for a review.		A- Stoudt's double has a hazy golden with some bronze highlights here and there. Not much of a foamage on this one just a off white sparse cap. Very weak lacing.		S- No doubt about, this was brewed in the east coast, that's apparent from the nose which is a sweet mess. This is going to be one malty MF'er. Big sweet malts, some alcohol, some perfume, light on the citrus, more of a floral type hop.		T- This does not remind me of a DIPA, more like a very tame english barleywine without all the complexities of a B-wine. A sweet cloying taste that is malt forward, the sweetness while big, just does not taste good. The alcohol does not help things in this matter. Perfume finished with small traces of grapefruit, no pine, no nothing, this stinks.		M- Sweet, rich, malty, boozy. The malt is on par for the style but the malt ingredients don't make it right. It's all that stays on the mouth along with booze. I could not even bring out more hop flavor with some swishing, what's wrong with this beer? Medium and abovve bodied with moderate carb.		D- Not for me, not again, not ever, it's been nice knowing ya."
"A-Murky amber/orange with a nice frothy white head that left decent lacing. All the particles make it look like dirty pond water, though.		S-grapefruit and pine resin. Thats about it.		T-Citrus hops, some spice, pine resin, a trace a malt.		M-On the light side of medium bodied, a bit astringent, a bit oily.		D-Too one dimensional to make this truly enjoyable. I finished the bomber, but it took some time.		Overall, this one is a disappointment, especially at $11 a bomber.	I've had several Hoppin' Frog beers now and paid $10-11 apiece for each and the only one that was even close to being worth it was BORIS. I think this one cured me of overpaying for HF brews."
"Pours a pale yellow gold and started with a thick white head that fizzed away rather quickly. Looks like a pale lager generally looks.		The smell is a bit grassy and slightly sour. Almost like a sour acidic mix. Not really pleasant.		I'd best describe the taste as off. Metallic, sour and doughy. One dimensional, nothing really notable in the hops. Gets more palatable as you drink more, I don't know if the off tastes fade or I've gotten used to them. By the time I'm half way through the pint it is a mix of corn and grain. Not bad enough to call it awful, but really not good.		Mouthfeel is average for a lager. This isn't watery, just not as lively as some better lagers are.		Drinkability depends on the situation. If I was in the desert, this would be like an oasis, but really it is just another adjunct lager without much flavour."
Bottle: Poured a deep clear brown color ale with a large foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of unrefined and stale grain is not very enticing. Taste is also dominated by stale grain with some light residual sugar. Noe ester or hops presence could be identified. Body is about average with medium carbonation. No brewing flaws per say but just an incredibly bad brown ale.
"Straw colored, a lot of carbonation, huge head with not retention, huge bubbles, dissipates almost instantly.		Light citrus and earthy hops. Some sweet malt finishing the beer.		Caramel, apple cider, extremely subtle hops. This beer seems like it is trying to turn to the cider relm, but done so with hops, malt, barely, and yeast vs huge amonts of sugar and chemicals. 		A bit sticky and thick given the 5.6% and the rather light style and nature of the beer. Still decently drinkable. 		Certainly the last time I have this one, but Im oddly not upset about this one. The fact that it is about 2 bucks a bottle doesnt hurt."
"The CANQuest is unstoppable! Someone had heard of my efforts through the grapevine and brought a CAN each of both of the CANned Cucapa beers to a recent trade show for me. CAN you believe it?!?		The pour resulted in two fingers' worth of deep-tan head with low retention. Oh well. The color was a deep brwon with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose was malty sweet with light notes of coffee and chocolate underlying. Mouthfeel was medium with a soda pop-like fizziness and I got a harsh astringency on the tongue, initially, which gave way to a more pleasant cocoa/coffee flavor. Finish remained mildly chocolate/coffee, but that initial sourness seemed to linger. I would go with the Chupacabras and leave this on the shelf."
"12 oz. bottle, procured at the Hi-Times Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA,		A: Pours a very dark brown, with a full tan head with good retention.		S: Strong sugar and coffee scents, some chocolate.		T: Roasted malts, sweet oatmeal, molasses are the dominant flavours, though the flavour isn't as big as I would have hoped for in this style. Not bad tasting at all though.		M: Smooth and rich, creamy, though the heaviness doesn't hit you until the second sip, with some solvent character.		D: A nice beer, but there are better beers to be had in this category, such as Southern Tier, though the price is really good on this beer, compared to others of this style, so I'll probably come back to it."
"Pours orange-pink with a white head and decent lacing. Somewhat weak retention. 		This smells strongly jammy, with lots of tart cherry scents exploding from the glass. 		The flavor is pretty strange. If I had to compare it to another brew, I would say that this tastes like a slightly less sweet version of Lindeman's Kriek with a lot more tartness and an odd underlying sweaty, minerally, mustiness. Not too bad, but as the glass slowly disappears, I find myself less and less interested in finishing it. Lots of cherry flavor, to be sure, but too sweet and funky for my tastes. 		Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slick consistency. Chewy finish. 		One is enough.		Glad I tried it, but would not buy again."
"A little extreme in character. Reminds me vaguely of an Innis and Gunn, but overpoweringly sweet and with a harsh alcohol burn in place of a creamy finish.		Nose is molasses/burnt brown sugar and fruit, and is somewhat interesting. Very sweet up front followed by a quick alcohol punch. Burnt toffee finish.		Interesting, but needs some polish. This is for sipping, not for quaffing. The small bottle serving is quite appropriate given its punch."
"A- This beer pours a translucent dark amber, red. The head settles almost like it was poured from a nitro system. This leaves a thick head that laces the glass aggressively. It looks incredible.		S- Piney hops and fussel alcohol hits you square in the nose		T- The taste is full of bitter piney hops and alcohol. Herbal and some gin like flavors going on. There is a surprising malt balance, but it is a little overshadowed by the hops and alcohol. This beer is huge, and is definitely a sipper. Like a very hoppy barleywine.		M- Very chewy and viscous. It's has an oil like consistency in the mouth.		D- At 13% ABV this is beer to sip slowly. I can't see myself wanting more than one or two in a sitting (and 2 is probably too much). 		Great beer for what it is- a huge sipping brew that overwhelms your tastebuds with flavor. Interesting and worth checking out."
"I am not quite sure what to make of the Pike series yet. They seem to be a bit hit-and-miss. I am hoping that the Tripel is a hit...let's see:		Appearance: Unfortunately for me, I am underwhelmed so far. The beer barely had any off-gas when I popped the top and poured a pretty cloudy slightly brownish yellow color with practically zero head after an aggressive pour. There is no lace whatsoever and the beer looks like brownish lemonade in my glass...still and just....(blech!)		Aroma: There is some sweet malt in here mixed with a little bit of spice that I think is from hops as much as anything. There really isn't a whole lot going on in the aroma. There is some fruitiness starting to come out as the beer is starting to warm up some, and it is being led by an unusual for the style, green apple.		Taste: The flavor departs from the aroma, thank God. There is some maltyness that is the predominant part of the initial sip, but then the hops set in pretty quickly and lead you into the finish pretty much. There is some spice that is both from alcohol and the hops, but the alcohol is a big player in the later part of the finish. The body is medium with pretty much zero carbonation, so it comes across the palate quite lame for this style...to say the least.		Opinion: I don't really know what to say about this beer except that the HUGE lack of carbonation really hurt this beer. It isn't ANYTHING like the style as a result. The high carbonation is essential for this style. It may be better if it was lighter on the palate. I'm sorry, but I have to slam this beer for the style because it really doesn't hit any of the crucial marks."
"500 mL can from the LCBO, best before May 2012. I have tried the mocne/strong lager from this brewery and it was decent-to-tolerable, but I'm a little more picky about pilseners. 		Pours a familiar pale golden-yellow colour, with slightly more than a finger of bone-white head seated on the surface. It fizzles out quickly, leaving patchy wisps of film and a thin collar around the edge. It looks fine but the aroma (or odour, rather) is a bit off-putting... there are some bready malts on the nose, maybe a bit of hay, but there is a lot of vegetal character. The ethanol is also noticeable, which is hard to believe given the abv.		It tastes a bit better than it smells, but not by much. Lots of grainy malt and bready sweetness, with very little balancing hops. The same cooked-corn-and-cabbage notes from the nose are here in force. Weird, unpleasant solvent-like note toward the finish that may or may not be the missing hops... it lingers briefly in the aftertaste and dries the palate a bit. Thin-bodied and watery, with good, moderate carbonation levels. 		This is the worst Polish beer I've yet tried, and definitely the worst pilsener I've had in a long time, if you exclude the 'fake' ones like Molson's Old Style Pilsner or Lakeport's equivalent. I consider myself a pretty generous reviewer as far as fizzy yellow lagers go, but even if I took this as a Euro pale (which it more closely resembles), it's an underwhelming pint. Do yourself a favour and don't bother with this."
"Said it before and i'll keep saying it until they stop these ""light"" versions of beers. Light golden color with completely NOTHING special to offer. I see the ""light"" versions as experiments gone wrong and I can't really see the reason why they are distributing them to the public...		Cheers"
"Had on tap at Happy Hours in Kracow. Served in a tall glass, cool.		A-yellow amber body, very thin white ring head.		S-cabbage, antiseptic		T-stale hop taste, some cereal and medicinal aftertaste.		M-light		D-did not care for this beer at all. Way to many off putting flavors. I would not drink this beer again."
"Wheat beer.	Pale golden, lightly veiled. Quite compact and creamy foam, white.	At the nose, it starts with camomile and floreal notes, then some warm and slighty burned, and then again sweet malt and light caramel. And fruity: apricot and pineapple.	In the taste malt and ripe fruit, pineapple overall, with some peach and a light citric note. Not really fresh.	In the aftertaste the pineapple again, and fruity. Some citric, and some more freshness than in the taste.	Medium-light body."
"Pours really pale, some foam laying on top and quite some carbonation in there. Dull looking beer.		Malts, perhaps some sugar and alcohol. Typical euro pale smell thats really not there.		Comes on palatte weak. Some alcohol tone lingers with the taste of can, fish and perhaps some malt in there? Really disgusting.		Bad, bad, bad. Really bottom mark on this one."
"330ml bottle purchased from the International Beer Shop in Perth.		Pours an extremely pale, golden yellow colour, with a fine ring of white foam. Some large bubbles persist in the centre of the glass, but they sit pretty static and still. Body is surprisingly solid, and hold some tight, fine carbonation. Eh. It's not too be, all things considered.		Nose is unpleasantly sweet, with big honey characters coming through, laced with something slightly spicy, but not particularly fragrant. It smells extremely underfermented, or something. Else, it has the lingering nuances of too much sugar in the boil. Unpleasant, really quite unpleasant.		Taste is marginally better, just because it's less intense. It still has the obscene sweetness, but the overt carbonation helps cut through this somewhat. There's still a sting of spice in the tail, but it's very subtle, and it doesn't really add much interest to the beer. Feel is light and slick, but it doesn't have much to work with.		More mediocre than anything. It's perhaps not actively offensive, but it's extremely dull. The characters it does have do err on the side of unpleasantness, however, meaning this is yet another Matso's beer I'm happy to confine to the pile of Do Not Want."
"12 oz bottle into a weizen glass.		A: Hazy dark gold color (although it seems to get clearer as time goes on) with a thick, moussy white head.		S: Bland soapy mixture of wheat and yeast with no discernible clove tartness that one usually associates with a Hef.		T: Soapy phenols and an unpleasant bitterness dominate. Completely inappropriate for the style. The banana/clove taste seems like it's there below the surface, struggling to get free, but just can't.		M: Medium-bodied and smooth with a spritzy carbonated finish.		D: Bland, unbalanced, and too bitter for a Hef. Definitely does not have the drinkability of a real Hef."
"Appearance - pours a caramel, iced tea color. A thin cap of eggshell foam ends at a partial covering where it holds pretty well.		Aroma - smells like a Tootsie roll with a side of cherry, like cherry cough syrup. As billed, and pretty good, but not great or beery in the least.		Taste - a light toasted grain presence, tastes a bit diluted. The chocolate comes across partially nice, partially like artificial flavor. The cherry provides some needed lightness and fruitiness, but the beer has a candy non-beer feel to it.		Mouthfeel - nice body, pretty crisp.		Drinkability - I like sweet stuff in general, but this didn't have enough beer presence for me."
"14.5oz chalice		A - It was an orange color with a white, one-finger head. No lace.		S - It smelled of malt and ginger.		T - The overwhelming taste was ginger. The malt was sweet and light.		M - It was crisp and smooth. A light-bodied beer.		D - Too much ginger tasted for me. If it was toned down a little it could be very good."
"I had this beer (from notes) on tap in a shit bar in amsterdam in 2010...		A pretty poor beer. A pale yellow color, lighter than regular Amstel, with a small fizzy white head, and a light smell, and taste, just crisp pilsner malting, with no sign of hopping. its got a selzter like body."
"From a 1/2 liter bottle into a pint glass.		A: It pours a gorgeous reddish-coppery brown, with two fingers of fluffy, creamy, lacy white foam. Terrific head retention and excellent lacing. 		S: Bacon. It smells like bacon. Also, faint woodsmoke undertones.		T: It tastes like it smells, predominantly like bacon, with some softer wood smoke tastes mid-palate. There is a perceptible sweet mid-palate malt characteristic that helps to make it taste more like beer, and less like breakfast. They definitely nailed the smoky/savory aspect of this beer, and it seems like a really solid style example. 		M: I was a little disappointed with the mouthfeel. it felt too thin and carbonated. I was hoping for something a little smoother, slicker, heavier and/or creamier. The thin mouthfeel seemed mismatched with a flavor profile that is almost entirely smoke and meat. 		D: This is definitely not sessionable. Granted, this is not a session style, but even with that in mind, this one would be a chore to have more than one."
"Thanks to projectflam86 for this bottle. My 100th review.		A: Pours a a cloudy peach. There are oranges, reds, and yellows all mixing together in this brew. Almost no head. Absolutely no lacing as it drinks.		S: Smells of sweet malt, rubbing alcohol, and nail polish.		T: Starts off with a big blast of acne astringent. There is some malty sweetness in there, some toasted oats, but it's mainly big boozy alcohol. I'm not in the mood for this beer. After two years in a bottle, I figured this beer would mellow out a bit, but it didn't.		M: Sticky and chewy. This beer coats the palate, and lingers forever.		O: Honestly... this beer is gross. I wanted something exciting for my 100th review, but this beer was a huge disappointment. Founders should stick to stouts. They always knock those out of the park."
"Tried on tap at Sydney's Local Taphouse US Beer SpecTapular.		Pours a very cloudy light gold colour. Almost sewerage in colour. Almost no head. Some filmy lacing carb minimal.		Very sour cidery nose, lots of green apples and a light astringent character. It's not bad but it's not terribly beery.		Also very sour on the palate, almost verging into lambic sourness. Cider characters are dominant. And it has a really astringent sour back palate. Some yeasty notes. Mouthfeel clean but thin. Not a huge fan. If it were marketed differently I might approve (The ""Two Metre Tall Partially Lambic Weirdness"" springs to mind), but I don't believe it's meant to taste like this - infection all the way.		Overall, not terribly impressive. It's just sour and weak. Not very pleasant. It's a chore to finish even my 60ml sample."
"Poured on a pint from a 330 ml bottle. Cucapa is one of the few new macro breweries that are changing the way beer is conceived in Mexico, where macros like Modelo (corona, bohemia) and Cuahutemoc Moctezuma (sol, tecate) are King. Saying this, I think that the Cucapa Light, is a way much lighter version of a company who usually brews beer with character, and in my opinion it would be only appealing to newcomers to the world of craft brew. 	A: Light yellow	S: Herbs	T: Acidity stands (as in Cucapa's stronger versions), but without the maltiness to suport it.	M: Very light bodied	D: For me, none. But it might be a conservative choice for people really used to macros and I wouldlnt be so sure about it."
Pale yellow with a thin white head. Crisp, clean taste with little real character other than a grain sense and a thin, watery mouthfeel. This beer has much in common with many American light lagers from the macro brewers, but cost more than domestics. I'll give it an extra point or two for the attractive can.
"The colour is yellow with a tint of gold. The large white compact foam dissolves into a two finger thick foam. 		The smell is kind of weak with some dry malt and a chemical bitterness.		The carbonation is fresh with medium sized bubbles. It is rather short.		The taste is weak; there is almost no taste of malt or any body at all. The hops are dry and artificial. The aftertaste is watery with some sweet and bitter notes.		This is a very cheap and boring low alcohol beer."
"Moderately chilled and poured into a Duvel glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. 		Appearance: The beer pours out a clear dark amber/orange color with a "" off white head that soon recedes. Initially there is some modest lacing which is soon gone but a thin ring around the liquid remains.		Smell: The aroma is lightly bready and has some caramel malt in it but there is no real hop presence		Taste: The flavor includes caramel malt, hints of bready malt and nutty tastes and there are traces of floral spicy hops, but nothing dominates or stands out.		Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is thin and there is not much carbonation. The relatively short finish is dry with some hop bitterness trailing off.		Drinkability: While this was an OK beer I'll not return to this one and I probably would not buy this one again if I'd already had one. I definitely prefer the Long Trail Double Bag Stucke Alt."
"Appearance - 2.5	Poured a thin, white, bubbly head over a golden body.		Smell - 3.0	Slightly sweet, grainy, little in the way of off aromas.		Taste - 1.5	A little stronger in flavour that most Aussie macros, but certainly nothing special. Grain, husk and metallic hops are all there, finishes with moderate bitterness and a slight chemical taste.		Mouthfeel - 1.5	Slightly astringent, low carbonation.		Drinkability - 1.5	A little refreshing when ice cold, but otherwise it is not an easy beer to drink.		OVERALL - 2	There are worse macro lagers, but there are plenty of better ones too. I'm not really sure who drinks Emu Export (or why), it's just another beer in the bland, yellow, forgettable sea of mass production."
"A - Bit of a hazy red/copper with a decent head.		S - A little bit of graininess, but kind of bland overall. A bit tart smelling?		T - Oddly sour, with some citrus cut the otherwise bland flavour. Unremarkable bitterness in the finish. A little bit on the sweet side as well.		M - Expected light body with a ton of CO2.		D - Not good."
"thought this might have been their regular beer with new packaging. turns out its new. pure filtered. full strength, refreshing, crisp, and hey fewer carbs to boot. lets get it on.		gotta admit, for a clear bottle, its damn sexy. if you're into that sort of thing. looking past that, 330ml, 4.7% abv. best before 02/07.		as you'd expect, clear very pale yellow. little carbonation. formed a decent enough white head which settled to a bit of lace.		actually, its got a touch of hops in the nose. slightly grassy, but the adjunct type sweetness starts to overwhelm it as it warms. 		goes a bit downhill from there. a light sour acetic twang hits pretty quickly. too bad there isnt much else to cover it up cause its not strong. a touch of sweetness in the middle but its gone by the finish when the sourness makes an unwelcome return. 		was expecting a bit more from these guys, not sure why. this is not something i would be going back to."
This is a very bland beer. What'd you expect? I must say that its better than most light beers out there especially all the other American macro light lagers. It has a light golden color and pours a thin almost not there head. It smells of hops and some malt and has a hopy bitter taste but its a little watered down hence the term light after the name.
Got this bottle a couple of weeks ago at Surdyk's in Minneapolis. Poured a decent white head which quickly all but disappeared and no lace. Color is a clear light to medium amber. Aroma wasn't bad: malty and hoppy in a standard world beer sort of way. Flavor was much sweet and hops weren't much present. Was a little taste of honey. Body was ok and carbonation was a little spritzy. Finish was mostly sweet with a touch of bitterness. Not a lot here. Forgettable.
"Pale gold in colour, generates plenty of fizzy white head, but that fades rather quickly. Champagne like bubbles throughout.		Smells fairly soapy and flowery. I don't pick up much on the malt side of the aroma.		Certainly a biscuit like malt flavour, semi sweet. Hops seem to fall flat on the palate, giving a watery finish. Faint metallic aftertaste. Does not impress.		Mouthfeel is fairly standard macro lager. Watery and fizzy. Carbonation not as sharp as some.		Too bland to be offensive, but also too bland to be very drinkable."
"Rauchbier Weiss Beer: A weiss smoke beer, brown in color and definitely smoky in the aroma. Very little head, what there was dissipated quickly. WOW, I do NOT get this whole smoke beer concept. It tastes like an arson investigation. Consequently, I swirled the yeast at the bottom and added it to the glass. That&#8217;s better, it went from a felony to an aggravated misdemeanor. Really bad."
"12 ox bottle into Mug.		This beer pours a straw yellow pee like color hmmm i wonder...		Smells like nuts and new leather with a hint of sneaker as well		Tastes kinda like it smells minus the nuts.		mouthfeel is nothing impressive		being an import this beer is kind of lagging a lot of flavor. Lets go amsterdam we know your good for weed lets get to the beer."
"The beer appeared a very pale yellow with a small, light, and fluffy head that disappeared in the blink of an eye, with no part of the head retained and no lacing.		The beer gave off a light corn-ish aroma. Not much else.		The taste was actually a little better than expected, but less than average. Heavier on the malt than most of the same style, this provided for a little sweetness. Not much else.		The beer was pretty light. The carbonation was a bit too high, but honestly one of the better beer for this style. I might choose this one if given the choice over most BMC beers."
"pours bright clear golden yellow with 1/2 finger head that fades to nothing 		smells of corn and some grains some booze		tastes of sweet watery corn a little grain decent bitterness but the aftertaste is awful		mouthfeel is light watery with very little carbonation 		drinkability is not good since i did not even finish half the bottle"
This is a strange beer. It pours with a decent finger of foam, then fades to zero in a minute. The smell is sweet cooked grain, and caramelized sugars. Color is a nice deep reddish amber. Nearly flat, saccharine taste just like the dusty stick of gum from a pack of baseball cards. Very sweet and grainy like a German Bock, but without the smoothness. The taste, smell, and feel are unpleasant, leading me to drainpour this and rinse immediately. Gross. Not recommended.
This beer has its virtues, but it is not an enjoyable experience. The appearance is a nice cloudy amber brown with lots of yeasty bits floating about. The head is off white, retains a bit, not much lacing. The aroma is profoundly whisky alcohol, dark and heavy fruits, such as fig, rind, apricot, raisin. This is a full bodied beer, quite syrupy in consistency, and just plain thick and overly sweet. There is also an oaky aged quality to the beer. The taste mimics the aroma. You'll get the full gamut of heavy fruit flavors, a cloying candied sugar sweetness, and a syrupy thickness that is just over the top, and that oaky aged quality that is more apt in a bourbon. The killer for me is the alcohol throaty burn. I feel like I'm drinking a sweet whisky drink and it just burns on the way down. This is the type of beer that leaves me with a heartburn afterwards. It's just not drinkable as a beer. For a 9.3% ABV, this tastes like it is thrice that much. Way too much alcohol, and not my cup of tea at all. It's too bad, because the beer does have its virtues, just not as it is presently consistituted. The aftertaste is just doing me in. If I wanted a sweet whisky concoction, I would have mixed one myself.
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottling code of some sort but no clear date. It was a pale straw color. Had a carb fount in center of glass but no lacing. Had an average sized white head that quickly dissipated into a thin partial collar.		The aroma was typical light lager - malt, grain, cooked corn, skunk. The taste followed the aroma. Not much here but a tad better than a BMC so my goto beer in a BMC only place.		Overall, a step above a BMC. The default choice for me when it's this or a BMC. Goes down easy enough but not much flavor. Not a player in the home rotation."
"2-11-2009 - fresh bottle	i drank this one while brewing a similar 90 IBU IPA, so i wasnt paying as much attention as i usually do to what i was drinking. pours a nice gold orange cloudy color with some nice off white head that has decent retention. decent lacing. the smell is some earthy hops, a nice malted smell. huge body to this one, great mouthfeel. a very powerful earthy hop taste, and some pale malts are definately there to balance it out quite nicely. just a little bit of the alcohol present, not much. this is a great beer, i could only hope mine will turn out this good. the drinkability is kind of spoiled by the 10%, but still enjoyable in moderation. i had no idea it was anywhere near 10% when i bought this. this one is the first beer from stoudts ive had and it was pretty memorable. i just layed one down for age in the cellar as well.		3-15-2010 aged 1 year 8 months	found this in the back of my cellar. i have a previous review on 2-11-2009. this was bottled on 7-23-2008.		pours a slightly cloudy golden orange color with some slightly off white head with some pretty good retention. lots of sticky lacing on the glass as well. looks delicious.		lots of earthy, resiny, piney notes, with a little bit of tropical fruits from the hops. kind of the pungent side. a nice caramel malt balance. a little bit of the alcohol present there. as far as i can remeber drinking this beer about a year ago, the hops havent seemed do really die out at all as i would have expected.		really nice caramel, crystal malt like flavors that give way to a strong, pungent, burning like hops flavors. earthy hop like flavors. gives way to some pretty strong alcohol. definatly more on the malty side, but some nice hops showing through. you can notice what changes a year and a half has done more so on the taste than the aroma.		strong, heavy mouthfeel. resiny on the tongue and mouth from all the hops. big body, with some rather light carbonation. quite smooth drinking as well.		about as drinkable as all the big DIPAs. however the 10% is hidden very nicely."
"Odd beer; way different than their original strong red and not nearly as good. Poured a brownish amber with a nice, light tan head and decent lace. Aroma was unusual: very malty with burnt grain. and hints of rancid nuts. first taste was awful. But tried it again after a bit o' cheese and a sesame cracker. Thank goodness! then It wasn't so bad, more like the aroma, minus the nuts. Carbonation is sharp, force carbonated. Cleaning agent finish with the malt."
"Pours a deep cloudy orange-brown with little in the way of a head. A clumpy sheen of tan foam hangs in the center of the glass and leaves a bit of lacing on the glass.		Smell is strong of alcohol and soft hops. Flavor is a bold malt note of caramel, spicy hop flavors and quite a bit of alcohol burn. Mild bitterness from the hops but by no means a monster.		Mouthfeel is thick, quite a bit like apricot nectar - quite 'fuzzy' with solids but no carbonation to lighten the palate. Finishes with heat from the high ABV which does not encourage another sip.		More like a barleywine than an IPA, very high in alcohol but without a clearly defined hop profile to bring the drink to life. Not exactly everyday drinking but an interesting and unusual brew.		[Thanks to TikkiGodxxx for sending so many Midwest brews to the Left Coast]"
"Thanks to sweemzander for hooking me up with this one.		12oz bottle poured into standard pint.		A- Pours a burnt orange with some nice reddish hints. Just a slight haze to it. A finger's worth of head that leaves a small cap on the beer.		S- A decent bit of malt and some alcohol is picked up right away. Also a combination of meat and or pork with a touch of dish soap. I would have to say it is a little off putting.		T- I still pick up a big dose of pork and soapiness. Beyond that, slight hops and a little sweetness with some butterscotch and some maple syrup. 		M- Medium bodied that feels like it has barely any carbonation. Relatively smooth on the tongue.		D- I can't say that I would reach for another one of these but you are supposed to age it and so I will and see where it takes me. There is just a weirdness right now that makes me want to stay away."
"I tried this in The Brickskeller in Northwest Washingon, D.C.			The appearance looked really good. Nice reddish brown color, with a very appealing head. I should have stopped and just admired the beer in the glass, because it went rapidly downhill from there. 			As I brought the glass to my face, I took in its aroma. A lot of thoughts went through my mind, most of them borne out of the primal ""fight or flight"" instincts that flow from being in imminent danger. Try to imagine taking a SlimJim, putting it in your mouth, and lighting the opposite end of it on fire, and smoking it like a cigar. Then put the SlimJim fire out in a full ashtray. That's about what the beer smelled like. Absolutely God-awful. When people say something has a ""smoky"" aroma, that usually means it has HINTS of smoke. To say this beer has a ""smoky"" aroma doesn't do the word justice. Try a four alarm fire. That makes more sense.			The taste hit me in the gut like a sack of bricks. Truly vile. If you melted down a vat of SlimJims and tossed in a healthy portion of cigarette butts swept up from the floor of a corner pub, and then brewed a beer with that, you get the idea of what this beer tastes like. I seriously got through about six or seven sips before I started to feel ill.			The mouthfeel was OK. Not too sudsy, not too harsh, not too thick or thin.			Drinkability is as close to zero as I can rate a beer. Absolute gut rot. I've never had anything quite as vile as this. I couldn't even finish a quarter of my pint. I told the waitress to pour it down the drain and give me the bottle so I could show my friends the tangible proof that I'd drank this swill and survived the experience, and warn them to stay away."
"bottle from some place in KY near Cincinnati, pours like mentos in a bottle of coke. Takes 5 pours to get a glass.	smells like watered down cheap bourbon... and nothing else.	Tastes pretty much the same, watered down bourbon... the bourbon is supposed to accentuate the stout, not be the primary, nor is it supposed to cover a crappy stout. There are tiny hints of a stout trying desperately to creep out of it, but Hey, lets hop on the bourbon train and try to sell a lot of crappy mistakes.	mouthfeel, not much there, kinda like soda water... no thickness, large carbonation tastes like it was artificially carbonated.	not good."
"My bottle actually says Pils, but it's a very similar label to this one and it appears that they only make 4 types of beer, so I'm fairly sure this is right. 		A: Clear and orange with intermittent carbonation. Healthy yet quickly dissipating head.		S: Metallic but fruity malts, like many German beers. 		T: It oddly reminds me a lot of this very cheap beer I used to buy in the US. Slightly tart and dirty malt. A bit of sweetness. Not	great.		M: Mouthpuckering in a strange way.		D: It's not a great beer. Given that, I could still drink it."
"Overall: Brand-new 2011 beer from Balashi, Aruba's national brewery. If Corona Lite had sex with Miller Genuine Draft Lite, this beer would be their progeny. Not at all worth it.		A: bottles are only like 10oz! WTF? Bottle appearance is of a underfed, pasty Corona. Very, very thinly yellow colored ""beer"". Medium carbonation. 		S: just like Corona. Lemony grass, sour-smelling.		T: JUST like a cross between Corona and Miller Genuine Draft. Both Lites. This is not a good beer by any measure.		M: is their one? No taste = no aftertaste. 		Medic25 is absolutely spot on the money: this beer is frantically YELLING for a lime wedge or Something to give it flavor. Yikes & yucks! Get it whilst you can, this ""beer"" won't be around long..."
"Poured from a 1pt .9oz bottle into a pilsener glass.		A - Hazy yellow color with a head of white foam. Decent carbonation and lacing.		S - Smokey and slightly herbal.		T - Tasted like drinking a pilsener with a piece of applewood smoked bacon in the glass. 		MF&D - Needless to say this was not my cup of tea, or beer in this case. I guess its a good representation of the Schlenkerla style, but being a Hells lager I didn't expect such a smokey smell/taste."
"A friend left a few of these at my place last night... might as well give it a proper honest review.		First off... only 3.5% abv? That's awful weak, I didn't expect anything higher than 5%, but am surprised it's that low.		It pours (into a pint glass) a clear golden color with a bubbly white head. It dissipates extremely fast and no lacing at all.		The smell is muted, but there is some straw present, a little bread notes. 		The taste is more of the same... nothing offensive, but there's just not much there. Earthy notes, but nothing bold, straw flavors on the aftertaste. Not sure if it was hopped at all, but I'm not picking up any. 		Very thin and watery, to be expected from a light lager... nothing to really enjoy here, other than a cold flavorless beer. It's easy to drink, but I wouldn't want to drink another one. Certainly not on my dime."
Bottle: Poured a slightly hazy golden color ale with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of banana esters and wheat malt are easily noticeable but also some corn which kind of ruin the aroma. Taste is also dominated by weird corn-like aroma which I didn't appreciate - this is too bad since the core beer seems to be well done but this aspect just ruined this beer.
"This beer has a lot of complex flavours, but unfortunately, it didn't really do it for me.		The peated malt is apparant, and there is some residual sweetness, but overall, it was too bitter for this style. The flavours were just a little harsh for my tastebuds."
This beers pours a crimson color with burgundy highlights. Nice volumnous tan head comes and goes. Moderate lacing. Aroma is striking of dark fruits and Belgian candi sugar, I couldn't get much else. Maybe some chocolate notes. Taste was simply not the best. This beer has a very sweet red fruit flavor to it. Reminiscent of communion wine. Yeast doesn't provide the phenolics or flavor depth or contrast I'm looking for. Finish is somewhat artificial and a bit acidic. Body is on the light side. Just not my cup of tea.
"Opening a 2009 - this beer is opaque black with little head and a strong coffee flavor. Smells charred and bitter as if they burnt the coffee before putting it into the barrel. 		This one tastes more chocolate-y and bourbon like. The vanilla notes are much more muted this year than the previous years and I honestly prefer the extra vanilla's presence. Not really complex flavor but decent mouthfeel. Honestly, I enjoyed the aroma more than the taste bc I could pick out the sweet/fruit notes better that way.		This beer isn't that complex. Maybe I've been spoiled - maybe it's not aging well with the bourbon notes mellowing and bringing out the coffee... I just know that it didn't live up to my expectations."
"Not my best review. Not rated to stated style as the rating would be very low.		So I can't tell if this is supposed to be a sour stout, but it is.		Appearance:	The huge, continuous head seems to me to be the first sign that this is either intentionally or accidentally sour. Other than the fact that I can't seem to pour more than two ounces at a time, the beer has a nice dark color with lots of tan head.		Smell:	The cherry scent again tells me I'm dealing with something going sour. I smell cherry/sour more than anything.		Taste:	Like Avery's Depuceleuce or something. Not getting stout and not getting 60 IBUs.		Mouthfeel:	Nice and medium in the mouth. Light for a stout, but not like drinking water or anything.		Drinkability:	If you like sours, this is on the lighter side. For me, I've been working on this bomber for over an hour, hoping I don't have a headache in the morning."
"I got this beer at La Plaza Santa Ana where the brewpub/tapas bar is. One of two choices, the other being ""light."" Btw, this beer is a Munich Dunkel. I will email BA with proof to get the style changed. Anyway, the beer came in a standard mug (0.5L) and has a dark amber cor with not much of a head, though it does leave ok lace. The aroma is overy malty. Not much hoppiness detected. The maltiness is definitely toasty and roasty. The taste is way too sweet...the residual sweetness is overbearing. As is the alcohol, which should be hidden much more. It's very much a hot alcohol, which really started to come out as the beer warmed. This hurt the drinkability. I am glad and happy that there's a Spanish brewpub, which is a nice change to all the wine that is served here."
"Pours a dark brown color with a tan head that leaves almost instantly and no lacing around the glass.	Smells of roasted malts, could this be a decent low alcohol beer.	Taste is very sweet (sugary not malty) up front then muddy water flavor that finishes smooth and leaves a slightly malt taste on your tongue. This is a very weak beer and has no malt flavor until the very end and it's sugary sweet yuck! There is weak carbonation. 		This is not a good beer do not try it. I'm going to poor this one out it was cheap"
I bought a single bottle of this from Capones, in Plymouth Meeting, PA last weekend when they had their beer event. Today with some homemade pizza I tried it out and it was bad. It had the appearance of pee and smelled the same. I man upped and took a taste which I spit out into the sink. It left a very strong metal aftertaste in my mouth and reminded me of Red White and Blue or Iron City. I was really disappointed in this one and would not let any of my close friends buy or drink it.
"A= It was dark in color like a brown. No real head.		S= The only thing I smell in this beer is bourbon.		T= The taste is the same as the nose bourbon and that's about it.		M= Right amount of Carbonation for this beer.		D= A lot of people like this beer but I just don't like it at all hard to get through IMO. I have a few bottles left I'll gift them and probably won't try this one again."
"A: Deep chestnut, light tan head, no retention or lace.		S: Strong alcohol (tequilla?), port, sour fruit.		T: Harsh alcohol (tequilla? ), sherry, spice, licorous, moderate bitterness.		M: Well-attenuated and dry, light to moderate carbonation.		D: More like a tequilla shooter than a beer. I really couldn't drink more than a couple of ounces."
"This was a freebie.		Pale gold with a big white head--what a pleasant surprise! My mirth doesn't last long however as said head quickly fades and vanishes. Sigh.		Smells like a lager..and canned corn. I may be imagining this but there may be a hop cry for help in here somewhere.		Tastes like obscenely light , watered down grains, fish tank chemicals and some kind of vegetable potion. Has a buttery ""eew"" in back. I'm not going to try and determine exactly what said eew is because I'm trying with all my might not to focus on it. Eew. 		If people think Bud represents American brewing the way that I believed that Amstel represents the Netherlands, I understand our bad rep. That said it appears there's bad beer all over the world."
"A-Pours a burnt copper color with a half finger that quickly dissipates.		S-Smells of allspice and a bit of cinnamon with some light, sweet caramel malt notes.		T-Really spicy upfront with mainly allspice and a bit of ginger and finishes with some sweet, dark fruit and more spice	.	M-Very dry feel with medium to high carbonation and a thin body.		D-Really over-spiced in my opinion; hard to get down the first pint I poured, this could be a drain-pour."
"Picked up an O'Fallon sampler while in St. Louis.		Loud, fizzing tan head that exhausts itself and dissappears. Murky, translucent brown color. This beer looks flat and ugly. Sorry fella.		Smells good. Chocolate covered cherry candies and hints of blended whiskey. Good stuff. 		Tastes like diet cherry cola with an ensuing butt-tastic Anbesol/anteseptic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin and snappy. Ick."
"A- Deep gold with a decent head that leaves some lacing along the sides of the glass on its way down.		S- Lots of grassy hops with maybe a touch of sweet bubblegum and earthy yeast aromas. Not enough of the classic tripel yeast byproduct smells for my liking.		T- Cloying malt melds with the grassy hops to create an altogether unpleasant flavor. This tastes less like a tripel than an under attenuated pilsner. Goes dry at the end with a light bitterness.		M- Slick, medium body with a good dose of carbonation.		Not impressive, to say the least. I got none of the classic tripel flavors from this. It tasted more like a pilsner gone bad than a tripel. It's cheap, so if you want to give it a shot, have at it; it won't cost you more than five bucks. If you want a decent tripel, however, look elsewhere."
"Serving Type- Served from a chilled 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.		Appearance- A dull dark amber look with a rusted copper undertone. Has about three fingers worth of tanned head that laces quite nicely compared to the other Kirkland ales.		Smell- Has a faint smell of coffee due to the roasted malts. Comparatively speaking it has an overwhelming smell of hops which isn't saying much.		Taste- Again, comparatively speaking, it has roasted malted flavor with the slightest hint of sweetness. The aftertaste is an overwhelming bittering flavor that takes over the experience and leaves a bitter tinge in your mouth.		Mouthfeel- Has a moderate amount of carbonation that dissipates rapidly. Medium bodied, like all IPA's it has a small bite and not a very crisp finish.		Overall- I'm not an enormous fan of IPA's so take this review for what you will. I bought a variety pack from Costco because it looked interesting and, well, I was curious to see what kind of beer Kirkland Signature produced. Considering that it just might be the most inexpensive beer that I purchased in a long time, it led up to my expectations. Compared to most IPA's however, it wasn't all that impressive."
"After a very aggressive pour the beer settles incredibly clear (as the name suggests) and looks like soda water. It is topped by a bubbly, pinky width head.		A vague skunky aroma is about all you can say for this beer, it is so bland it is unreal. At a big push & after really putting your nose in the beer you can just about detect some sort of mild citrus like smell too.		Very bland & tastes almost like carbonated water with a hint of sweetness, this is followed up by a citrus & lemon flavour at the end. Not terrible to taste but seriously lacking flavour for a beer. No sign of any bitterness in this one but a bit of a skunky taste in the finish.		Very light bodied & bland, almost like drinking water & as such it is incredibly smooth but not in a good way.		Whoever let this beer come onto the market needs their head examined, it tastes so bland & flavourless that you'd be as well having a water.		My blog @ http://abarwithnonam.wordpress.com"
"Deep amber/brown with a strong ruby hue to the liquor. Moderate head with good lasting time. Decent lace.		Smell: strong caramel with a dash of licorice. Light hop in the background.		First impression is that this is a far thinner beer than I expected with a low carbonation level. Reminds me of a homebrew. Mild flavor: some burnt malts and some crystal. Good hop finish, but I would not describe this as hoppy. Nothing ""bad"" but it just sorta fizzles--sorta like catching a fish below the minimum size: you get some fun, but you're gonna throw it back anyway."
Tried this on tap during a happy hour, came highly recommended. I love bourbons so was looking forward to this. I don't know if it was the particular day, but I couldn't get over the cloying bourbon taste here, it tasted like an extract and was far too strong to work with the beer. I could barely choke down the pour...
"A - Poured out a brown color with hints of red. It had a small, short-lived head that left no lacing.		S - It smelled of chocolate and cherries.		T - It tasted strongly of chocolate and cherry. It was very sweet.		M - It was soft and a little thin.		D - This is an interesting beer. It tasted like a Tootsie Pop. It was a little to sweet and chocolatey for my taste in beer."
"Uncertain if this is an amber, or pale based on label, WTF?		Review date: 10OCT11	Bottle date: unk says 210B on the label, maybe (July, week 1ish?)	A: Pours a hazy dark amber ale with a finger of caramel cream which falls quickly to a broken sheet of the same. Spotty lace is weak. (2.5)	S: Smells like caramel malts, sweet. Some earthy hops, and toasted sugar (3.5)	T: Oxidized malts, water, an alkaline tone, and some bitterness. Unimpressive. (2)	M: Thin (for either style) with moderate carb. Dry finish. (2)	O: I am not impressed and not surprised I've never seen this on tap anywhere (2)"
"Poured from 12oz bottle....excuse me...11.2 oz bottle.		A- Pours a golden straw color. Looks to be very carbonated. One finger white head comes and goes leaving whisps of foam on the top of the beer. No real lacing..everything sort of falls back into the beer.		S- Very sweet smelling. Almost sickly sweet. Very grainy and bready smelling as well. Nothing really else going on with this. 		T- First off let me say the sweetness in the back end of this on the first sip almost made me gag. There is some light toasted malts in the front end of this beer. This turns into a sweetness that keeps going through the rest of the beer. Light grain tastes as well. Some bready malts in the middle. Hops are not really there per say and just kind of stand there. 		M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is pretty over the top for me. Sweet malts dominate everything from the palate to the aftertaste. The aftertaste has a bigger sweetness to it than the whole beer in the mouth did. Everything in the mouth feels like it was just covered in a sugary sweet slime. 		D- The drinkability on this one is god awful. I remember almost liking this one when I was a little younger but now I just don't know. I had a hard time drinking this one and ended up drain pouring the last quater of my pint."
"$2.39 Single from Food N' Fermentation in Godfrey IL. 	New beer in Illinois i've never seen... 		Poured into a rinsed stange glass this generated a foamy head, lasting momentarily before the first sip, then deflating in a cascade of lacing. Thick ring of foam that flecks randomly inside the glass. Deep gold, almost red in indirect light.		Aroma is odd, sweet tea-like and buttery... candy corn?		Taste is similarly tea-like, suggesting faded hops. Hard to pick up any honey flavor here. Real gross aftertaste. Seltzer carbonation, and weird off flavors of corn and play doh. Blehhhh. 		This may have been mistreated on the way to Illinois... but as this is it's first appearance, it's just sad."
"Tasted this beer at the now Fuller's Head of Steam pub in front of Euston Station, London, on 21/08/05.		It pours a dark golden hue, no beer head and gentle carbonation. The aroma is restrained and simple, dominated by Fuggle hops, with some harsh note of hays, very very lively hoppy as a whole. The palate has dryish and tangy hops and a lightly grapefruit-peel taste, leading to a zesty and dry finish and medium-bitter aftertaste. Overall the mouthfeel is quite lively, but very thin in terms of body. A ""clashing"" mouthfeel of hops is also left towards the finish, showing no sign of softening. A slightly off-the-target golden ale/bitter."
"I have tried this a few times at the brewery seeing if maybe I got a bad sample or was in a bad mood previously and maybe I'd like it better. Unfortunately, I'm left with the same feeling each time I tried it. 		Pours a brownish copper color with nary a head that fizzes off quickly. No lacing or bubbles but I do like the color this beer possesses.		Smells of sweet fruit, apples and pears along with a burnt off whiskey character. Quite sweet with a touch of nutty graininess as well. Not too bad.		Taste begins with a quick super sweet, almost syruppy malt fruit flavor. It's a bit off but then it gets taken out by the intense rubbing alcohol character. From that point to the finish all I get is band aid taste and a hot alcohol flavor. Possibly some green apple cider vinegar in the finish. Very alcoholic and almost unfinishable.		Weak body which can't really support the flavors yet somehow seems syruppy at times. There is a bit of richness to it that has its moments. Decent, but the mouthfeel just gets lost by the numerous off flavors. 		The only reason this was worth finishing was the price. I have tried it three times now at the brewery and will never try it again.		The other reviews seem to like this beer for the most part, so maybe you should try it, but I wouldn't recommend it. I'm so glad Founder's bottled the much better batch of Old Curmudgeon and just has this on tap. 		Get bottled Curmudgeon!"
"This is really not a very good beer. I don't say that because it's a lighter style. It's just not good.		Poured with a foamy head that immediately vanished. The beer was a light golden color with a touch of visible carbonation. No lacing at all.		Aroma was like a stick of butter. A sense a diacetyl bomb coming on.		Unfortunately, I was right. This is a butter nightmare. There is a slight grain flavor with little hop character and no finish. It's just the butter flavor that sticks with you.		Mouth feel of slick and oily. Also no finish....		Drain pour. Not worth 125 calories. Sorry."
"No freshness dating on the bottle but this has only been bottled for a week now.		A= Pours a nice deep amber color with a small non existant head on it that falls to a ring around the glass. Nothing too interesting. I've had it on tap before and it at least looked better.		S= The smell has a sort of green smell to it. It smells like a brewery when you walk into it actually or the bubbling of a homebrew. Hops and grainy malt. A somewhat subtle nose on it as far as IPAs go however.		T= The taste is again sort of odd for an IPA. Definitally on the maltier side of an IPA. The hops are pretty small and I feel like a raw grain character is more dominate than the hops. 		M= Too high on the carbonation and the taste doesn't linger like most good IPAs.		O= I've had this on tap and it was much much better. I was at a beer dabbler event so I didn't bother to take notes or write reviews on it. This however is a much different beer. The flavor is muted and the hops don't dominate like most IPAs. This is more of a strong pale ale or something. Really not an IPA and really different than I remember it being on tap."
"My least favorite of the 8 Haymarkets I had. 		A: Light golden with good head retention and medium lacing. Bone white head.		S: Not much going on in this way of fruity esters or clove as one would expect. 		T: Again, didnt get much out of this on the flavor end. Light is basically all it amounted to on taste.		M: Seemed flat though there was the head staring back at me. 		D: Wouldn't choose this one again, which is rare to say because I enjoyed most all of them to a great degreel"
"Pours out to a brilliantly clear amber with ruby accents, forming a small and soapy biege head with poor retention and average lacing. Little bits of stuff are gently suspended. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is fresh with resinous, piney hops, brown sugar, an interesting combo of husky grains and vanilla, and a strong note of orange-blossom honey. Mouthfeel is soft with a lightly dry finish and medium body. Taste begins with strong flavor hops (mostly resinous with a touch of citric) with a moderately strong bitterness, a touch of graininess, toast, caramel, and brown sugar. Hints of beef broth and soy sauce. The finish has residual strong bitterness overshadowing the orange-blossom honey flavor.		Surprising that this modest ""American Pale Ale"" from Kentucky tastes like something Stone would brew. Hoppy as all get out without any balance whatsoever. Still, a well-crafted brew if that is what you're into. One is plenty enough for me."
"12oz CAN into a regular kitchen glass.		A- A nice reddish/ amber color with a nice, gorgeous actually, dark tan head that looked like liquid brown sugar. Very bubbley with legs to stand. No lace, just some small dots on the top.		S- Smells regular for the style, some malt character faint hops with no bitterness. Small dark fruit aroma and a hint of chocolate but I may be off on that.		T- Very bland, very basic and not opening my eyes at all. Malt sweetness with caramel, no hops hitting the tounge, not even a lick. The little bit of pear in the back is helping but not much. I know this is a basic style and all but I would take a yuengling over this any day.		M- The build stops short of medium with a smooth but almost watery feel. There really is not much going on here. The carb seemed ok by the nice head, but this is pretty dead.		D- Not really, I figured since this brewery just came into the area that they would send some fresh product. This is just not doing anything for me. ""way down in the hole.""- Tom Waits"
"Some chap left a few of these in my fridge after another epic-if-I-may-say-so party at my home, so one found itself into my glass on the 4th of July.		A. Fizzy, very clear yellow-gold. Low head, only a tiny amount of lace. Fairly pedestrian. No freshness date on the bottle, alas. This could be 2 months or 2 years old for all I know.		S. Pale European-ish malt, a bit of hop, some honey, some... grain. Boring, sadly. Really not much going on here, maybe a bit of specialty malt, crystal...? But it's a reach.		T. Sigh. Holy Grail Ale simply HAS to be better at the source. 	I have nothing against a quafffable English session ale, but this is not only boring, it is borderline bad. Thin with too much malt sweetness for what it is, has a slight red-apple sweetness on top of all that, and diacetyl (butter) that absolutely does not help. A little too much DMS (corn) puts this into insipid territory. HGA tries to be wet and quenchable and all that, but the hops have died (or were never there to begin with) and the entire experience is rather poor.		M / D. It's wet and sweet and frankly, stale tasting. I'm sure this is way past its prime, and this review would be patently unfair save for the fact that there is simply no way to tell how old the bottle is. Monty Python comedy is alright, but if you're going to use the name and logo on your beer, is it too much to ask that you make an effort to put your best product forward? Apparently it is. Disappointing, and left unfinished. Do not go out of your way to find this beer unless you have it on good authority that it is fresh. To this beer, I say ""Ni""."
"This Maibock is a very sparkling amber with a small white head. It has a salty aroma-- a faint whiff of soy sauce. The palate is watery and gritty. The flavor is like a vegetable garden with black pepper. Is this on purpose? Not sure what the deal is here. The beer sitting next to it was really good and I wrote a shining review for it. The server could only identify it as ""the dark wheat"" but everyone else at the place denies there is such a thing there. It was also very obviously not a wheat beer... or dark. Bummer, really.	(rated May 24, 2007)"
"Amber color, light amber I guess.		A nose of alcohol and sugar - caramel, maple syrup.		Flavors of maple syrup, whiskey, and alcohol.		Split one 12 oz. bottle between 3 guys, and we still didn't finish it.		C'mon beer nerds, I mean really. Is there what we're really investing our street cred in? A new generation of jock mentality childish neanderthal flavored beers? It's gross, way to fat, big, out of balance etc. and the price is through the roof! I'm sure it's costly to produce, but that doesn't make it worth it."
People from Lousiville seem to be really impressed with this brewery, me not so much. This was an OK APA for taste, but the smell had distinct notes of TUNA FISH CASSEROLE. I am not kidding, I even passed the glass to my wife for conformation. The taset did not reflect this smell, so that was good, but the smell was very off putting.
"This is a scandinavian lager, the recipe is created by Anders Kissmeyer of Norrebro brewery in Copenhagen.		A - Clear golden with thick white head.		Sm - Biscuit and caramel, slight spicyness.		T - Very light taste. Biscuity and almost no bitterness.		M - Light body and alot of carbonation.		D - Its an ok beer, but gets very boring. The styles fault I guess."
"A: Deep orange with a little brown. No head.		S: Nose reminds me of Sauternes (a famous desert wine). I smell graham crackers, cleaning fluid, faint hops.		T: Balanced for a rich, sweeter style beer. Bananas. Graham crackers. Hint of peppermint candy on finish. Sweet. Short finish.		M: Creamy and lightly bubbly. Just enough hops and bubbles to keep this one from being syrup like the 120min. IPA.		D: Nightcap beer. Too sweet for multiple drinks. 		Another over-hyped beer. Bourbon aged beers with high alcohol are almost always too sweet for a beer (no beer is too bitter for me). I'd rather drink real Bourbon or have a glass of desert wine. It's still much better than, let's say, the 120min. IPA. Try with blue cheese."
"500 ml bottle from Lithuania		Pours golden with swarms of small carbonation bubbles and foamy light yellowish head that soon sags in the middle and later dense layer on the top remains, generous patchy lacing. Aroma is malty with hints of herbs.		Taste is alcohol malt, short glimpses of herbal hops and sharp bittery/sourish mild nutty aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation.		Overall, slightly strange, but not in a good sense."
"12oz bottle poured into a Delirium Tremens tulip.		This is an interesting one for me. At this time, it is my second barrel aged beer and my second Wee Heavy, and the first time both come together for me. Not really sure what to expect but here goes!		A - Pours a really muddy, ruby red color with brown and plum highlights. Builds about a 2.5-fingered head that is almost gone before I can turn around and look at it again. Some minimal lacing on the side I'm drinking out of, but besides that the glass is pretty scarce.		S - Smell is dominated mostly by sweet, smokey peat, malts, and bourbon. Oak and earth tones are really prominent, and after straining, I can barely pick up some fruit and vanilla notes.		T - The first thing I really pick up about the taste of this beer is the overbearing sweetness in the aftertaste. There's the Wee Heavy characteristics I found before, and the bourbon is there too, but the most memorable thing about this beer is the long, sweet aftertaste. Could definitely benefit from more bourbon character or some way to balance the sweetness. The finish is long, and I can pick up the vanilla and oak a lot more easily than the nose.		M - Mouthfeel is medium to heavy with mild carbonation. Rather than getting more of the bourbon shock I experienced with Weyerbacher's Insanity, this leaves the palate relatively barrel-taste free and the most forward characteristic is the sweetness.		D - Drinkability for me is fairly low. It may be just me getting acclimated to both of the styles, but I found this to be a real sipper and it wasn't easy to get down. For me, the sweet malts were just too much for this beer."
If Tabasco was looking for a beer companion this is the beer for them. This beer is very red and the look gives a window to the true spicyness of the hops. Also it smells just like it tastes. Very hoppy with some of the hops balanced with malt. The alcohol (8.5%) is quite hidden behind the bitterness. I would definetly see Bodb Derg the famous red skinned god of the ancient Irish drinking this.
"Bottled 13 May 2011.		Pours clear, a slightly reddish deep amber color. Is the red just my imagination, or is it actually there. I still can't tell. Fluffy off-white head with a pinkish hue. Good retention and lacing.		Smells of sweet malts and tart cherries, with some kind of weirdness lurking in the background. That weirdness has a chemical feel to it, though I can't identify it, and really doesn't make me excited about drinking it.		Tastes starts out tangy and fruity, a bit like a powdered drink mix. Then tart cherries come through, but are quickly displaced by an odd bitterness that doesn't fit well in the beer and really puts me off. It's got that same chemical air to it that I picked up in the smell, and it sticks to the back corners of my tongue. Finish is dry but persistent, and dominated by that chemical bitterness, which lasts for way longer than I want it to. Feel like I need a glass of water, or a better beer, to rinse it out.		Mouthfeel is fairly light but syrupy, a little sticky. Medium carbonation, could probably use some more. Finish is an odd combination of drying and sticky - I'm almost convinced it's going away, but then it grabs on tight and stays there, just barely detectable.		A bitter fruit beer? Yuck. Not sure if that's what they intended, but I am most definitely not a fan of this. It has an odd combination of flavors that just don't work well together at all. By far the worst beer I've had from Founders. Compared to my standard for cherry beers (NG Wisconsin Belgian Red), this isn't on the same planet."
"Poured chilled at the white house in ale glass		A: no head; no lacing; carb action only ok	S: honey honeysuckle; very boozy; vaporous	T: very sweet; malt liquor at its worst; wretchedly sweet and boozy; unpalatable; no hops?	M: dead		Look, if one wishes to get plastered, do it with vodka, not swill like this."
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a pint glass. Pours a deep golden color with a half inch head. Head doesn't linger but does yield some light lacing.		Notes of grass, hops and sweet malts on the nose. A bit musky. Somewhat creamy of roasted malts on the tongue with a thick close. A bit sweet and cloaking with a simple sugary tingly finish. Feel is a bit numbing and drinkability is unimpressive. In fact I didn't finish it. Certainly could have, but thought I'd prioritize some better tasting calories.		Not really familiar with the style, yet this brew doesn't impress."
This brew has a light caramel malt aroma and light color.  In fact, this beer is very light all-around.  The caramel flavor in the brew is quite watered down as is the light bitterness in the finish.  Too light to make a good impression.  Not a favorite.
"A: Light motor oil. Pours just a skim of light brown head. Really kinda stagnant and flat looking. Even the small amount of head doesn't go down or change at all, like pond water. 		S: Smells like a BMC lager at first wiff. Then it smells like very astringent Amaretto, with some nare burning varnish. Fucking gross.		T: Pretty much the same as the smell only slightly masked by some insignificant roastiness and english style bittering. 		M: Putrid. Like swishing and swallowing chemicals. 		O: Definitely something off with this bottle. It was just shy of flat and clearly smells like varnish. Can't apologize for hating this so much. Ends in a drain pour after 3 sips."
I read some of the previous reviews that were questioning freshness. I bought mine near Louisville and it was six months old. I am not sure why they call this pale ale. It does not have a pale ales hop aroma or sharpness. This beer tasted burnt. It was also variable in carbonation level. The six pack I bought was like beer roulette. No telling what you are going to get. I would not buy this again. Even if they fix the variable carbonation and get the burnt part under control it still will not be a good pale ale. They need to drop this recipe and start over. To me pale is is sharp crisp and and drinkable. This beer is none of the above.
"On Cask at Volo - part of their Cask Days 2006....	The Appearance was a hazy-red, with no lace...it came across looking like a 1/2 lambic and a 1/2 weiss....	The smell is of strawberries, kool-aide, and wine....	The taste - if ""rushed"" is a taste, then that's it...taste's like a fruit punch that is full of malt....it tasted like they rushed this batch into the cask for the event....	The mouthfeel is thin, and drinkability is low."
Clear Golden color with a medium head. Hoppy bitter aroma, however slightly skunky. Bitter and skunky flavor. Light bodied. I will Try this beer again only because I have heard such good things about it. I think the bottle I had was miss-handled and became skunked.
"Appearance: Poured from a can into an Irish pub style (real) pint glass in low altitude Galway, Ireland, on October 1st, 2010. Pours a clear gold with a thin head that actually retains fairly well for a discount lager. Not really appealing. 		Smell: One light note of malted barley. Not looking forward to this beer. 		Taste: A bold-in-a-bad-way note of malted barley and the note of water typical in discount lagers. This is best described as beer-flavoured water. Unrefreshing. 		Mouthfeel: Thick, coarse, and far too wet. This is worth trying for novice brewers as an example of what not to do. It could be worse; at least the finish dries up slightly to make you want the next sip. 		Drinkability: Wouldn't buy it again, wouldn't drink it again. Worth saying it's better than most American discount lagers."
"Pours a murky dark chestnut brown color with a slightly yellowish jaundiced looking hues with a thin beige head that quickly disappears leaving no lacing.		Very earthy, swampy aroma with a little bit of creek water and old boot. Slight chocolate maltiness with subtle hops and a sweet alcohol presence which is very strong.		Again, the flavor is very earthy and leathery with a strong sweet alcohol presence, leathery maltiness, subtle hops, slight chocolate, brown sugar and dirt. There's also a strange vegetable presence with is quite unpleasant and a dirty bitter finish. 		This was quite a disappointment for me especially since I love pretty much everything from Founders and enjoy the occasional old ale. I will have to revisit again in the future."
Fat, oily and sticky. A touch of caramel and nuttyness. Surprisingly empty mouthfeel, lightly bitter, with some alcohol in the finish. A bit dissapointing, but not totally bad, the nuttyness is quite good, and the hops in the finish are OK, just tasted a bit raw to me.
Two finger head of soft white foam, lace of suds with no cling. Color is a 7 on the SRM Beer color chart. Aromas I detect are: corn, malt and roasted oats. Taste is a little tarnished, some flavors of browned wheat, onion, burnt corn, malt, and a light dusting of pine hops. Mouthfeel is somewhat on the skim milk side, not much body. Not the best balanced flavor, but sort of grows on you the more you drink...Still I think I will stay away from this in the future.
Had a big old head when poured. Head didnt last long. Head was white in color. Not much lacing either. Beer was golden yellow in color. Had some big bubbles at first but that didnt hang around very long either. Had a slight skunk smell, not really a heavy skunky smell. Reminded me of Heineken. Had a skunk taste along with citrus and maybe lemon. Had a slight bitter aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth. Felt a little thicker. Not really a beer that I would want to buy again. Their porter is much better.
"A: Poured clear with a nice thick white head that disappeared quickly. 		Smell: Sweet, but nothing that stands out.		Taste: Sweet with a little bit of hops		Moutherfeel: Clean with an ok amount of carbonation. 		Drinkability: It's ok, but nothing crazy.		This beer is just average. This is something I would share with friends if I had on hand, but I don't know if I would recommend it.		I am kind of shocked to have found this beer in Mississippi."
"These were sitting out on display as singles....figured why not grab one.Not the best idea I have ever had. Probably should have picked a different beer to be my very first BA review.		A- Poured an orange/yellow color with no head to speak of		S- Sweet smelling alchohol, malty		T- Sweet, overpowering ""booziness"", bitter finish		M- On the medium side with low carbination		D- Not for me. One a done and barely one at that."
"A - Golden with 2 fingers of fluffy white head and good retention with patches of frothy lace on the glass.		S - Somewhat light aroma. Wheat, citrus zest, some floral notes and spciy clove.		T - Very metallic, wheat malt, spicy with some citrus.		M - Light to medium body but with a heavy feel, hard to describe but almost doughy like. Slightly boozy.		D - Somewhat of a disappointment."
"On-tap at Prime 16 into a 3/4 pint glass.		A: Clear pale amber body with a finger of fine white foam head. Average retention and lace. Not bad.		S: Nice citrus and pine hops up front with a solid caramel malt backbone. Pretty nice.		T: Starts out hoppy, but quickly transitions into over-sweet malt before a potently alcoholic finish. Too sweet, too hot, not good.		M: Thick and sticky with moderate carbonation.		D: Cloying and boozy. I shan't have another.		Notes: This one has potential with a tasty hop profile, but but the hops just can't stand up to the overwhelming sweetness and booze. There are just too many great DIPAs to spend money on this one.		Cheers!"
"I find it hard to review this beer if only because it's so clearly not a stout. If I were reviewing some sort of weizenbock, then maybe it would be easier.		Very strange looking ""stout"". Brown hazy beer. Almost looks like coffee with milk in it. Off white head. Instantly obvious this is not a stout.		Ok smell, but lacking any characteristics of any stout I've ever had. Getting some malts and wheaty sweetness. 		Not a terrible flavor. Mostly malt, zero hops, again that wheaty essence. Un-stout-like.		Quite thin. Mouthfeel is definitely the worst aspect of this beer. Weak carbonation. Definitely on the boat too long."
"Deep brown amber. Small head even with great lengths taken.		Smells of mineral spirits.		Kind of weird in the mouth. Sweet and thick, chocolate milk, hot alcohol. Not what I expected at all. Some bourbon especially in the aftertaste (back and sides of the mouth) along with a lingering bitterness.		I have absolutely no idea why this is classified, here, today, as a Scotch Ale.		Too sweet and thick, not enough flavor, misplaced bourbon (to try to hide the hot alcohol?).		Bleh."
"Special thanks to bwyker for sending this beer along as an extra. Thanks for trying. The beer was served in a pub glass.		Appearance: The beer has a ruby opaque black coloration to the body. The head has a light tan coloration. The head has minimal retention. 		Smell: The smell of the beer is very subdued. Lightly roasted coffee and chocolate great the nose. 		Taste: Ever so slightly roasted coffee and light kiss of chocolate combine with an astringent lemon dish soap finish. 		Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The body of the beer is light. The beer has a prickly carbonation. I let the beer warm to room temperature and it really didnt improve much. This beer met the sink after a half pint."
"45th review on BA	Bottle to pint.		Now that the 4th bottle of this beer set has been finished. I will let my Non beer friends have these bottles. Ring the bell on round 4.		App- You know that color when you just haven't had enough water to drink in a couple days and you just say wow thats too dark. Yeah that color.		Smell- I just went to the gym. I'm not sure if it's the socks on the floor or the beer in the glass.		Taste- Please don't try to re create or call this a Oktoberfest when there are countless breweries who do it so well. Choose another style and easier style. like go after BMC.		Mouth- Its a step up from Bud light. I think I haven't had that in about 10 years so I'm sure my F.I.L will give me some of that too.		Drink- I'm done. No more, giving away the other bottles. You guys want em?"
"Now let me tell you the truth i've tried a bomber 22oz of strong ale, deep lager, and IPA all in the last two hours watching the Ohio high school state champioship game, but I know what i know, let me start.		It's strong, astringent, and bitter the hops are every where in its holistic provisions, but the drinkability isn't like alesmith IPA or like an bells hopslam. The drinkability is for short. Taste it appreciate it and be done. That's what I'll do for that one. It's a sipper. 		The smell isn't that floral compare to Great lake brewery lake erie monster or any harvest ale i've had, and that's to be expected but i'm just trying to compare the floral scent.		the smell was deep amd hoppy at the same time. good."
Harsh, could not take more than a sip. Some malt, a tad roasted and oily, nothing else to balance. They could lose this one. Bottled version was better, carbonation from on-tap adds some temporary fizz, but otherwise no head. So see red colour, like a herbal tea.
"Just slightly above pale gold, one finger tall stark white head.	Not a bad appearance for this class of beer.	Slight sulfur aroma (from a can!), middling low level of lemony spiciness (saaz?), corn and boiled carrots and celery.	Light body, sulfur, kind of light lemon rind that fell in an ashtray.	Useless, this was free and still wasn't worth drinking."
"The LAST from the batch of Trafalgar bombers I picked up last week.		This one poured a lager yellow with a little head that quickly dissipated to nothing. This however does have obvious carbonation which is a somewhat pleasant change from their other brews. Smell contains some hop aroma, which is nice. That however is where the niceness ends. This stuff has an initial Pilsener bitterness but the finish is just so horrible it turns my stomach. I found the finish on this to be very metallic and extremely hard to stomach.		Unfortunately, this one is destined to exist at the bottom of the sink. Avoid this one."
Reviewed on 6/27/2010. On nitro tap at Founders. Pours black with a thick nitro head. Aroma of sweet roasted malt and an odd skunk-like aroma (odd in a tap beer, but it was there). Flavor of sweet roasted malt plus the odd skunk (less apparent but still there). It was very bland tasting -- not bad just bland. I was disappointed, as I had expected better from Founders but this is not one of their winners.
"Canadian style, covered six pack, containing long necked, 12oz bottles. Plainly labelled, with no freshness dating on either the bottles or cardboard container.	The beer pours a hazy, reddish brown, topped with a heaping mass of large bubbled, ivory foam. A good deal of yeast remains caked in the bottom of the bottle. The head settles into an even coating, coincidentally forming a smiley face in the patches lacking head. No lacing.	The aroma is almost non-existant, aside from a light, musty whiff of cherries. Very grainy, almost like porridge, making me wonder if they crushed the grain into dust before brewing. Old, wet wood and cardboard.	The flavor opens with a wooden, musty, grainy malt flavor. Entirely unattractive. Faint cherry and a vague chocolate feel that could have been more faithfully produced with the addition of chocolate malts. The cherry is (I never thought I'd say this) too mild. Nearly non-existent, aside from a nearly indistinguishable fruitiness towards the finish. Grainy caramel malt, moving into a cocoa-like, unassuming finish. Dryish, retaining the barest semblance of chocolate. An ambiguous, parsley-like tang in the finish, sitting unwelcomed on the tongue for ages. An artifical chocolate, similar to the popsicles, lingers in the finish. The carbonation is so hyperactive it makes the beer ricochet off the palate. Lightish medium bodied, with a powdery, textured mouthfeel.	Kristi and I purchased a sixer of this stuff for $3.99 while we were in Denver. The price should have sent up about four red flags, but it was normally $7.49. I assumed it was close to or recently expired, but since it was fully encased in a cardboard box and in the cooler, I assumed it was relatively safe. For the price it was fine, but I can't imagine this being good straight off the conditioning tank.	If not for the grainy, musty feel, this might be drinkable. Kinda wierd and artificial feeling, but it's possible I could have finished a bottle were it not like drinking cherry chocolate sawdust. Not my favorite."
"A- A yellow and copper mix that is easily seen through. Small head that leaves moderate lacing.		S- Small whiff of fruits and biscuit grains that merge with a slight smell of earthy hops.		T- An immediate taste of fruit esters and a malty sweetness that quickly disappears to a small amount of hop bitterness and a taste of roasted vegetables, maybe corn. Taste moves to bland generally quickly leaving little desire for another sip.		M- Thin to moderate body with moderate carbonation. 		D- Did not feel myself wanting another sip of this beer very often other than to make sure that I was correct in my assessment of it. Maybe this was a bad batch of it, I will have to revisit."
"Reviewed from notes:		appearance: golden yellow with a 1 finger white head		smell: corn, wheat, malts, sweet		taste: sweet, adjunct beer like, rather boring flavor		mouthfeel: thin to medium body, mild carbonation,		overall: this beer will just be chalked up to a novelty. glad I could drink one of Homer's beers.		Cheers,	The CPJ"
"Smells of malt but not much else. Pours to a bright yellow with a quickly disappearing fizzy head. Taste is bland without much backbone. Extremely slight bitterness typical of a lager. The carbonation is almost the most evident aspect of this brew. It tastes almost watery at best. If this is a typical ""light lager"" I won't be looking for any more."
I poured this awful beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was the color of gasoline. The beer poured with no head at all. The beer smelled sour and had a sour taste that was not pleasant at all. Little bit of a burn to it and earthy tasting. I will not buy again.
It is a good, regular pilsner, but not special at all. Smell remember the american pilsner style, and the same is true for the taste. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin for a bohemian pilsner. Taste is regular, similar to a regular pilsner (the malt taste is there, with a lot of hops). I was expecting more for a beer that founded an unique style.
"Appearance: cloudy, orange yellow, small head		Smell: hoppy, soap, and grapefruit		Taste: big hops, grapefruit, and small cantaloupe		Mouthfeel: bitter, smooth, and a sour finish		Drinkability: This to me tasted like an average pale ale...This is very representative of the style, but I do not think it excels...I will not be buying this again."
"Pale golden color, with greenish reflexes. White head, not very compact, average in persistence. Carbonated appearance.	The smell is quite hoppy, grassy and fresh, quite pleasant. Then it comes out the malt, more standard. Volatile hop.	In the taste the grassy hop is again well present, and it is also quite bitter. But then the sweetness ofthe malt comes out again. More standard.	Light body, bitter hop in the aftertaste, quite long. Then the malt.	Overall, not so bad."
"10 oz. draft pour into a barleywine chalice.		A: Average light brown, creamy head. Lasts long and very sticky. Very good lacing. The color was dark, dark brown and not quite black.		S: WOW. Or more like WHOA. Big bourbon whiskey aroma up front. Almost nothing but. (Not what I want in a brew AND I LIKE WHISKEY!) A little cookie, toasted caramel malts are there, along with a little grassy, resiny hops, but they are completely overtaken. 		T: Exact same as the nose. Nothing but bourbon whiskey. I got a little sweet cherry on the finish. After the first sip I thought it was interesting, but the novelty quickly wore off and just sipping the 10 ounces felt like a chore.		M: Medium body and slick texture. Average carbonation.		D: Hardly drinkable for me. I'm sure this is right up someone's ally, but certainly not mine. I was just completely overwhelmed.		When I got home, I checked they BJCP style guidelines... I love Founders, but, they missed the mark here. (Unless it was the Maker's Mark...)"
Pours a clean, pale yellow color with a small white head. In the aroma, small skunk and standard European pilsner. In the taste, a small skunk, dry malt, and a grittiness. A small bie and a light bodied mouthfeel, with a light, dry standard European lager. Standard, nothing exciting, its just OK.
"This is similar to, but less pleasant and enjoyable than, the same brewer's Before-After. I do not understanbd why this is listed as a Belgian Dark Ale as this seems like a doppelbock or maybe maibock or strong lager of some sort. 		Amber-copper, it has a medium tan head soon shrinking to a few bubbles, not very good and in fact rather ugly.		Aroma is strong fermented grain, wet rusty metal, old raisins. It is very strongly malty-sweet, simple, and not pleasant at all. In fact, it smells quite bad to me.		Taste is much better but not enough to save it. It is spicey-sweet fruit juice, raisin, a hint of toast and cheap brandy. It is lightly sweet with hint of faint spicey bitterness underneath. It is simple but tastes reasonably good but in the end is mostly fermented, alcoholic fruit juice and fails to maintain any interest in the face of the off-putting aroma. It is also very heavy for what you get. Drinkability thus fades fast."
Poured into my pint glass this beer is a very dark brown/almost black with ruby highlights. Barely any head but a thin ring around the glass. Smell at first is bourbon, straight up. As it warms some sweet chocolate notes shine through. Taste = bourbon. Holy crap this is heavy on the bourbon. I've had plenty of bourbon barrel aged beers in my day but this has the heaviest bourbon flavor of any. There's a hint of stout underneath but I can't get away from the bourbon. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and this beer burns my throat minutes after each sip. If you love bourbon this is for you but it is not very beerlike.
"this comes out of the bottle a murky brown and what little tan head there is gone in the blink of an eye. the nose is all nutty caramel deliciousness, like the pecans you get from street vendors in new york. it makes me really excited to drink. the taste is buterscotch at first. a really good sweetness. the zestiness of the hops takes over and fills the mouth. there's a nice taste of acohol, but it detracts from the mouthfeel because it lingers very long in the aftertaste. 		this certainly isn't a beer to have four or five of. but to enjoy one is a pleasant experience."
"This is a beer that I bought in April of 2009 and drank July of 2009. It's appearance in my sniffer glass was a brilliantly clear gold color. The head and lacing was white and minimal. The aroma was mainly dominated by hops. There was a pleasant hop-candy note and the typical citrus. Higher alcohol was also present in the aroma but not overly assertive. The flavor was dominated by an extremely assertive hop bitterness, which I expected. What I did not expect was the beer to be ""hot"", an out-of-balance alcohol flavor. This high phenolic character distracts from any subtle hop or yeast notes that are most likely there. Overall, this is a big beer in every department. Unfortunately, a possible oversight during fermentation caused it to be a little too big."
"A darkish golden beer with an initial big head that quicly fades to a thin layer of creamy foam, that leaves lacing on the side of the glass.		Smell is light malty with fruity notes. Total abcense of hops.		Taste is grainy with fruity notes. It even reminds me of the fruity flavors usually found in tripels. Normaly I do not taste this in this beer, but now I am doing a side-by-side comparison of Dutch pilsners and this one is sticking out. The beer is also sweeter than the other pilsners. What is also striking is the very low bitterness. It is in there, but is not nearly enough to balance the sweetness. Body is OK for a pilsner. 	Aftertaste is short and fruity."
"Presentation:	12 oz. brown long neck bottle poured into a drinking glass. Served at room/cellar (a.k.a. garage) temperature. No freshness date available. 	I grew up with Costco/Kirkland Signature products, so I couldn't resist trying their new line of beer. Sure enough, it's got Kirkland's signature quality all over it.		Visual:	Golden amber body, see-through clear. Fizzy tan head that bubbled away like a diet Coke. Slight caps left behind.		Aroma:	Very soft and faint pale malt, with quite the grainy nose. Plenty of lager yeast with a hint of skunk like wet dog hair. Slight hop sourness with herbal notes hiding somewhere beneath the grain.		Taste:	Very dry bitterness dominates the back of the tongue. A flash of fruit is notable in the beginning, leading to a smooth malty profile. Slight herbal hops in the middle before going back to the dry bitterness in the finish. Medium-light body with a slick mouthfeel; slightly rough carbonation.		Overall:	A bit sloppy; no real hop or malt structure. And nothing German about this yeast strain. This is more of an American lager than a German pils. I guess they think simply calling it such helps marketing? I may pass on this in the future.	If I were to pair it with food, I'd take a stab at some baked seafood, grilled veggie sandwiches, or some hearty pastas.		Cheers!"
"Reviewed 12/3/2008 (bottle):		Pours a clear brown color body, not cloudy, somewhat dark. A small off-white head that is quickly diminishing, leaving nothing after 20 seconds. Syrupy, chocolate aroma. Some dark roasted notes. Dark chocolate aroma with a fizzy cherryness too. Chocolate taste, a drying chocolate aftertaste, like chocolate milk. Somewhat creamy taste, but something is not quite right with the taste. Almost like a cola and a cheap cherry pie. Somewhat spicy aftertaste. Carbonated. What happened to this beer? Nearly undrinkable."
"Golden apricot in appearance. Head dissapates quickly and small lace remains around the edges of the glass. 	Aroma is distinct corn syrupy Eastern European, with hints of black licorice and no hops to speak of. 	Intense sweetness on the lips leads to a cidery, syrupy flavor with a dry finish. Slight hop bitterness in the back. 	Body is similar to someone with lots of plastic surgery: unnatural and pretending to be something its not. No complexity to speak of. Reminds me of some bad homebrew I tasted at a competition. 	Terrible aftertaste. 	I might give this to some malt-liquor drinking friends as a sort of step up, but I'm not sure it would be a step up. Good for getting drunk or cleaning out the sink."
"This one is the fourth of six in my OCB mix pack #3. I can't say I'm looking forward to this, as I have yet to encounter even a respectable beer from Trafalgar but every beer deserves a shot.		Appearance: Well, this one scores some serious points for the head of this beer. Solid thumb and a half of head that laces and retains like crazy. However, usually I would expect a red beer, to be...well red. This is more of an orange, leaning closer to Lager yellow then red. Good clarity though.		Smell: Sweet malt, with a rougher roasted grain smell, but something is off about the whole experience. I think I'm getting a touch of malt vinegar from the beer. It's not too strong though. It did take some warming to come out.		Taste: Starts out with an almost watery cardboard taste, which then turns to a be of sweeter toffee and honey flavored malt, which then gets destroyed by a taste, best described as malted dirt with the barest touch of earthy hops. There is some nice points in the middle of the beer, but it's not enough to save this offering. 		Mouthfeel: Well the carbonation does make it's presence known throughout the beer, but the aftertaste is that awful soil like taste and it lingers on the back of your tongue. Transitioning could be done a bit better too, as the pleasant middle doesn't last as long as you'd like.		Drinkability: The aftertaste really kills me desire to put this one back. It's not especially refreshing, and is surprisingly medium bodied, which in this case isn't a good thing. It's downable but I wouldn't want to be stuck with a six pack of this stuff.		Final Thoughts: After having this beer, my thoughts suddenly turn to the Simpsons and that episode where Homer has Red Tick Beer, not sure why but I think the Red Dog on the can might have done it. Anyways, I will give this to Trafalgar, they are consistent. When I need to tell someone a brewery to stay away from, they are at the top of my list. I know they sell mead, in addition to beer and maybe it's a bit better, however this offering was disappointing, which sadly seems par for the course for this brewery. I can't also help but ask, why they brew this? Their Elora Irish Red is quite a bit better then this, so why brew this stuff?"
"Yet another beer brewed for the Royal wedding: brown 500ml bottle, best before 31 Mar 2012, drank and reviewed 19 May 2011.		Bright, light amber body with a true white foaming head on top.		The smell was of citrusy hops, very little malt esters about.		The taste was also all about hops, it was a dry tasting beer with very little flavour. I found the beer to be weak in body and fairly boring from start to finish. It just lacked everything a special occasion beer should have (presence, style, depth, character, etc. etc.).		A very poor attempt at a wedding beer and one I'd not buy again."
Founders did not hold back on the cherries in this beer. It has a wonderful pinkish/red hew when poured with very little head. The nose is of pure cherries....nothing else I could pick up. Then the taste...WOW. It smacks you in the face with cherries. You almost want to chew on the beer due to such a bold flavor profile. It is not very drinkable due to its sweetness and cherry flavor in my opinion. Lacing was not bad by the way. Definitely a beer for the female crowd more so than not.
"Special thanks to AKBelgianBeast for this gem. Yes I'm a loser at LNBA FF. I earned this beer dammit! Oh and to top it off Frank has been sitting on this for a few years. Yummy.		So I've seen this one around and have always wanted to try it. But I'm not a huge fan of English ales. 		A- Caramel color with two inch frothy head. Nothing else standing out to me. Looks a bit dark for a pale ale IMO. 		S- Berries, coffee, toffee, and a creamy smell. 		T- Toffee and loads of something that isn't that cool tasting. You know, just something that is a bit off, like the actors in Monty Python. This is pretty uneventful and this strange bad taste is tough to get over. I require a shrubbery to get this bad taste out of my mouth. 		M- Meh, feels like beer sort of medium to light bodied. 		D- Not very good."
"Not much to right home about, poured with a slight white head, some carbonation. Light bodied, with hoppy beginning and end. Bought at a theater in London (3.20) where there was nothing else available; fortunately it was only a 275ml bottle. Don't waste your time if something else is available. The ABV is 4.1%."
Of all the beers in the sampler served at their taproom, I anticipated liking this one the most and was sorely disappointed. The beer poured with an opacity and creamy tan head that were true to the stout style(although I wouldn't consider this a dry Irish stout). The predominant smell was one of charcoal which was my first hint that I would not care for this beer. No other scents could be detected due to the overall burnt character both in the nose and on the palate. I've tasted and enjoyed smoked porters and stouts before, but they were much milder than this. It literally tasted as though liquid smoke was added to the glass. I don't think storage, temperature, or age were to blame as it was sampled at the brewer's taproom, so I have to assume that it was a legit representation of their beer. I'm much more a porter/stout fan than a hophead, and I literally had to choke down the small sampler glass. I spent 2 weeks in Ireland last summer, and through exhaustive personal research, really got a feel for what a proper pint of Irish stout should taste like. This wasn't it. Stick with the Sly Rye Porter, Dos Perros, or the Pale Ale when visiting Yazoo. I will be in Nashville soon, and will give it a 2nd chance. I'll update if hopefully, change is noted.
I was really let down by this brew. All hyped up and took me nowhere. Poured out to a pitch black color with only notes of a head. Nearly no carbonation at all, not to mention that any lace was a long shot. Aromas of coffee, chocolate and dark rotted fruit. Nothing amazing so far. Flavor was abrasive and acidic, with strong indications of alcohol and burnt malts. Mouthfeel was good and thick, but wasn't enough to save this beer from being a disappointment. I'd probably pass on this if offered again. I may re-review again, but as for now, this brew was a course in undesireable beerdom. Pass on it.
"When I see the Founders label, I always think great brews. This one pulls down that assumption. A decent, but nothing outstanding, brew from them.		Clear amber orange pour, quick dying white head  although it did leave some sheet lacing in the glass. A sniff exposed a orange / grapefruit tree growing in the glass, but alas, it did not transfer over to the quaff very well. 		A real woody brew, I guess thats the dry hopping. Small pops of citrus in there, but this is generally lifeless. Glad I only had one bottle, Ill pass on getting a sixer of this."
"Ok, so I wanted to try a new beer today, and this happened to be it. This was one of the beers of the month at my local brew store so I picked up a bottle.		after uncapping the bottle it smelled of chocolate covered cherries. The scent was very rich. The pour left a glass full of a deep caramel colored beer in my glass with minimal head. The beer seems to have minimal carbination.		The taste is very light. It tastes of cherries and imitation chocolate.		I'm rather disppointed, the mouthfeel is not nearly as heavy as I had expected.		Overall the drinkability is minimal in my opinion. I feel as though i'm drinking flat soda pop. This beer is very sweet and with minimal carbination. I wont be picking this beer up again."
"A: Nice dark brown color, deep red with light coming through it. Decent off white head that dissipates to a thin layer.		S: Sweet malt, raisons, and maple syrup. Nice simple and clean.		T: Slightly tart with dark roasted malt flavor. There is a bit of yeast in there. Not digging the tartness in this. 		M: Medium bodied, fairly high carbonation, and leaves a bit of a funk in the finish. 		D: Didn't really enjoy this, so no. Not really per se."
"A- this one pours an amber color with a reddish tint. a large head formed after a vigorous pour. it was fluffy and mostly white with a light pink tint. very different, but not that odd considering what this beer is. the head stayed around for a while, and left spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. 		S- even at just below room temp, this beer doesnt smell strongly at all. what i can smell is sweet and tart cherries followed by a little bit of grainy malts. 		T- again, very weak. but pleasant. almost cherry juice like. very sweet with a little bit of tartness at the end. 		M- medium bodied with an almost nonexistent level of carbonation. very juice like. no trace of alcohol in this one. 		D- this beer isnt for me. nothing offensive about it, it just doesnt seem like a beer to me. might be enjoyable on a hot summers day, but i doubt ill give it another shot. glad i bought one and not a four pack. not one of founders better offerings."
Let me preface this with saying that I love scotch ales - I love Old Chubb, and I typically love beers aged in bourbon barrels - Black Ops comes to mind. That being said, I had a really hard time finishing one bottle of this 4 pack. It was like drinking bourbon - almost no beer taste to be found. If you love bourbon, you will love this beer - but be warned that it is EXTREMELY overpowering. I typically love Founders beers - had the Breakfast Stout and Nemesis on tap last night -- but I can't see myself buying this one again.
"A - A deep brown color with a one finger head that lingers for about a minute before vanishing. No lacing.		S - Burnt hickory. Heavily smoked jerky. Caramel malt. A lot of campfire. This actually smells . . . nostalgic. I kind of like the smell, but it certainly difficult to rate because it is something so bizarre that whatever opinion I will be wrong on account of there being nothing fundamentally right about the concept of this beer. After a few sips the smell is no longer inviting. The nostalgia is replaced by painful memories . . . memories of the last time I sipped the beer.		T - Burnt hickory. A bit of a caramel malt in the foretaste. Mostly campfire in the aftertaste. As in gnawing on blacken logs. There is also some faint hop bitterness. It is strange to say the least. After a few sips it is horrendously univiting. This isn't even an acquired taste, drinking this is like eating campfire ash. It just goes against the natural order.		M - Smooth, thick, somewhat refreshing, although the flavor makes me believe otherwise.		D - Not good. It is worth trying, especially if you are a masochist. I tried to have this with some food (teriyaki pork loin, tortillas with black bean and corn salsa and jalapeno foccaccia) and nothing worked well (the salsa wasn't too terrible, but it was better without the beer). I imagine that the only successful pairings with this would be meat so heavily smoked that the beer's smokiness is overshadowed, but at that point, why not just have different beer? I was scared of this one, I really wanted to enjoy it, but it proved too repulsive. I have to give this to the drain. This is one style that I am glad not to see many breweries imitating in the states.		Note: Everything here, save the drinkability, was reviewed ""to style."" It's taste was not a ""pleasant"" smokiness, unlike the aroma."
"Smell right off is sugary, like glucose based sports drinks. Just a hint of dark or roasted malt character that I'd expect in a stout. I get a whiff of DMS too.		Deep copper and clear. Lighter and more translucent than any stout I've ever had. Smallish but lasting tan head.		Flavor is actually O.K. but not at all like a stout. Sweet like a bock beer with decent malt character. But some of the sweetness seems to be unfermented sugar, maybe some adjunct sugar. There's no discernable roast character at all. Hops are there for light bittering but basically not a factor.		Body is pretty light. Carbonation level is also high that helps give it a little bittering bite.		Probably not a beer I will have again. If this were put in front of me blind and someone told me it was a bock, I'd think it was an average effort for a brew-pub or homebrew bock. As a stout, it fails on so many levels. As a R.I.S., it's not even close."
This is easily comparable to a Guinness. Nice carbonation, long head and it is a dry stout just as advertised. Some roasted coffee flavor but the hop bitterness comes through from start to finish.
Sampled at the brewpub in mid-June, the stout came under black under a light brown one finger head that fades very quickly to film leaving only a trace of lace. The nose is far too subdued, with just a trace of burnt malt. The mouth was flat and light. The taste opened with very (too) mild smokey caramel malt, backed by almost no hops. There is chocolate and roasted nuts in the finish, leaving a mildly sweet aftertaste, but generally this is a bland product.
"Pours a jet black color with a tan mocha colored head that resides rather quickly. Lacing coats the sides of my glass beautifully.		Fresh brewed coffee, vanilla, oatmeal, roasted malts, toffee, smoked wood chips, black licorice. Lots of great smells coming from this brew, I can not wait to try it.		Smells a lot better then it taste. Very upfront pretty bold bitter dark coffee taste, charred malts, and should I dare say quite watery. A very teeny tiny sweet taste does try to show up but definitely is overpowered with the coffee bitterness.		Medium with light carbonation. A little sticky or chewy should I saw. Left with that coffee aftertaste.		I picked up a 4 pack and will compare notes with the others. Maybe I'll age one. Anyways this did not do it for me really that much."
"Found two different abv's listed. 4.8% and 3.5%. Calories @104. Split the difference on abv? Lol		Very clear, very pale yellow. Bright white head, slight wisps of lacing		Sweet grain malts, slight hint of corn tortillas, and a slight metallic note		Must agree with others that the hops are much more pronounced here than what is evident in the aroma. Malts tend to be metallic in nature before trending to a watery sweetness. Hops are quite grassy/dandelion like. Finishes quite bitter and dry. Annoying metallic taste clings like a barnacle well after a swig		Light bodied with lively carbonation. 		Still laughing at the rear label stating this is 'Mexican Craft Beer'. I guess it's safer than drinking the water."
Bottle from Rahman's. Pours off-white, with amber highlights and a foamy head, this is its best feature. Yeasty aroma, not too inviting. Above average mouthfeel, above average carbonation. So-so drinking experience and not so drinkable , though it clearly otherwise has a Belgium taste. Alcohol warming.
"Pours a turbid sort of golden brown with a bright white head that disappeared very quickly.	Aroma of muted pale malt and craked grain, picked up a bit of metallic (uh oh)	Flavor was dominated by a tinny sort of note which actually sort of made my fillings hurt.	Mouthfeel was a tad thin and watery and really lacks anything to offer in the way of balance or constructive characteristics.	Drinkability was really poor. I hope that something went horribly wrong with this batch and this beer is not supposed to taste this way. This brewery has made some relaly nice beers but this is definitely not one of them. Avoid."
"Pours a light straw amber with moderate carbonation and a hint of lacing. Smells like straw, hops, bitterness, and skunk. Tastes like watery straw with lots of skunk. Pretty light mouthfeel with average carbonation. This beer was not very drinkable, in my opinion - especially given that it is marketed as a ""premium"" quality beer here in the US."
"Poured from 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass.		Pours a nice red-orange amber with a two finger off-white head.		Aroma is florally, kind of like lavender, followed by some citrus. A little bit of malt in the background maybe, but mostly soap. Not quite sure what to make of it - never smelled an IPA like this.		Taste is like the aroma. Still getting that lavender or whatever it is. Maybe a bit of chemical-like stuff towards the end. Soapy. What the hell is this?		Mouthfeel is alright, what it should be.		Not sure what the hell is going on with this stuff. Really funky taste overall. Wish I hadn't spent 9 bucks on a bomber of this. I hope it was just a bad bottle or something cause this tastes pretty shitty overall.		EDIT: I emailed them about the bottle to see what might have happened. Two months later and no response."
Poured a red brown with little head. Strong aroma of smoke and little else.As for taste, this is my first try of a smoked beer. I can't decide if this is good or not, because the smokiness is overpowering! There just doesn't seem to be anything else there. The smell reminds me of a campfire that has been doused with water, and the smell of the hot steaming coals. Not something I think I'd try again.
"theres only one nice thing that can be said about this beer, and its the old 'its better than VB' chestnut. and quite frankly, thats nothing to be too proud of. some of the comments on this beer prove why west aussies are called sandgropers. theyve got their heads in the freakin sand if they think this is a quality beverage.		yes, its a very enticing looking beer. deep golden color, some excitable jets shooting around and a fair to muddling head. but while i like an attractive beer as much as anyone, im not there for the view. this beer has been compared to a blazing west aussie sunset, and after the first look the quality disappears over the horizon faster than one of said sunsets. no smell to speak of, its devoid of malt and the hops is like sandpaper down back. *yawn*		heres a message to all beer drinkers of western australia. LITTLE CREATURES PALE ALE!!!! it may be twice the price, but its 4 times the quality. get with the program people!!!"
"Dark, murky, amber orange colour with no head. Unattractive.		Dutsy, lightly citrussy with no real spice character. A little herbal.		Sweet, mildly floral and lacking in real character. Dull.		Medium body with moderately-high carbonation. Okay.		This is not a good beer. It lacks character, depth and witbier character."
The appearence of this brew is its strong point...it is a very deep golden hue with a very light head that disapates to a thin collar which then disappears completly. The hops are prevelent and remain so giving a lingering after taste not to my liking.
"I was really excited to try this one with all the hype it has received. A maple-bourbon barrel-aged wheatwine? Yes, please. Where do I sign up. Thankfully this was thrown in as an extra in a trade from a very generous BeerAdvocate so I got my chance to try it.		Appearance - Hazy orange in color with pretty much no head even with a really hard pour. As a result there is very little lacing left on the glass. I left some of this in the glass last night and this morning it is crystal clear so it appears the haze is coming from chill haze, I also recall it being crystal clear while in the bottle.		Nose - Smells strongly of honey, wheat, and some citrus. There is some fusel heat in there. Not very complex, the alcohol kind of kills it as it isn't a layer but a glaring fault. I'm guessing the honey is coming from the maple but really it has an orange blossom honey thing going on and not really something I would associate with maple.		Taste - The taste... it's good at first with a really great bready, wheat, honey flavors. I would really dig this and understand the hype if it wasn't for the fact that it feels like I'm taking a shot with each sip. I have had many a beer, similar in alcohol content, that was not this hot. A little bit of heat in the background can be great, it can add a layer of complexity to the flavor. In the case of this beer it's beyond that. It is so strong it takes away from the flavor. As the beer warms up closer to room temperature some of the heat subsides and a little bit of the bourbon comes out but it is still too hot. I wish I had another bottle so I could revisit this in a couple years.		Mouthfeel - Medium, creamy, body with a slight tickle of carbonation.		Overall - I don't get the hype. It's a decent beer but Terrapin Gamma Ray blows it away as does Sam Adams Double White. I'm glad to have tried it, with much thanks to Kelp, but I wouldn't seek it out again. If I were to come across another bottle I would age it, but I'm not going to trade anything rare for it."
"12oz bottle bought at State Line Liquors (DE) for about $2.50. Bottled on date of 8/4/10 (I think), so this one isn't that fresh at about 5 months. 		Appearance: Slightly cloudy, orange or light amber color. Half an inch of head reduces to a thin white layer. Very little lacing that sticks around.		Aroma: Very sweet. Solvent and boozy aromas of strong caramel, crystal malts are prominent. Sweet oranges and grapefruit are what I get from the hops. Smells like an American Strong Ale more than a DIPA. 		Taste: Boozy right off the bat. Flavorful but it doesn't hide the 10% ABV well. Very little perceived bitterness at the start, but this comes in a bit in the middle and end to temper the sweetness. The sweet booziness is the first thing you taste and the caramel flavor sticks around in the finish. The finish is sweet with a bit of citrus, but not enough for my preferences. Really too malty and not enough bitterness or fruity/citrusy hops. This might be a lot better if it were only 8 or 9% and a bit dryer. 		Mouthfeel: Low carbonation which doesn't hurt it. The caramel sweetness lingers which is not pleasant. 		Drinkability: I wouldn't be able to drink more than a snifter of this; I'm glad I'm splitting the 12oz bottle actually. It's not a terrible DIPA, but not something I will seek out again. If I see it on draft, I'd like to try it fresh(er)."
"Pours dark brown with an off white head that disappears. No real lacing.		Slight whiff of prune and alcohol. Hard to detect.		This beer is all sugar. Tons of brown sugar flavors, with alcohol soaked candied dark fruit and some over sugared coffee and some dark chocolate. Bitterness comes through the sweetness, and then is overtaken by a wave of sugar on the finish. Where the hell is the malt, the complexity, etc.? Ok, just at the very finish as your palate clears, you get a little dry cocoa and malt.		Decent body to this one. Can't knock it, although it doesn't really facilitate the drinkability. Body makes the sugar cling to the mouth. Alcohol cuts some of the sweetness, but overall, this is lacking. $1.95 for 1 pt. 0.9 oz., so it was a deal, but no way am I buying this again. Nothing off on this one, just very differently crafted. Not my taste/style."
Bottle: Poured a pale amber color beer with a medium bubbly head with some average retention. Aroma of unrefined grain is more or less pleasant. Taste is also dominated by some unrefined grain and medium sweetness. There is also a weird metallic taste which might be due to oxidation. It is too bad this beer wasnt better because weather was perfect too enjoy such a beer.
"Dec 12 11 stamped on bottom of 24 oz can poured into a mug.		Appearance - Pours big foamy white head that holds shape well and with decent retention. Patchy stick. Once the head is gone, it's gone - not even a small continuous paper-thin head. Clear dirty gold body.		Smell - Musky corn and alcohol. A bit of bubblegum. Not appetizing at all.		Taste - Sickeningly sweet. I dry heaved after taking the first sip. The musky smell combined with the strange artificial sweetness is going to do me in. We may have a drain pour on our hands. Has a musky finish and aftertaste. My absolutely first thought was ""there must be sugar added"" just by how unbelievably sweet it is for a beer that has no indications of being a novelty hybrid beer. Prominent booziness in the body.		Mouthfeel - Astringent, sticky, and solvent at the same time, some how. Not refreshing or appealing in any way.		Overall Drinkability - Even for someone looking for a nice small buzz, this has a chance of being a drain pour. Definitely not a tasting or session beer. Avoid."
"A- Pour is reddish brown with an inch of off white almost beige colored head. Some spotted lace as this one slowly fades away.		S- Aroma smells fairly metallic to me. Bready/biscuity malt mainly. Some roastiness as it warms. The hops are quite floral.		T- Toasted malt and nut, the metallic aromas are now in the taste. Finish has some spicy earthy bitterness. Really don't enjoy the aftertaste.		M- Medium carbonation & feel. Goes down alright.		D- This one definitely wasn't for me, it tastes like a brown ale with a euro pilsner twist or something. Way to out of style for my liking."
"Purchased and consumed in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, this one came in a green 33cl bottle with a bulge in the neck and a multi-colored label wiht the name across the middle, ""Premium Quality"" above, ""lager Beer"" below. All in English - no Arabic. Ingredients appear to conform with the purity law. Best before 08/06, I opened it on 12/22/05.		Pours a clear, bubbly standard gold under a very thin 1/4 finger off-white head that fades quickly to thin collar, leaving no lace. There is no discernible nose at first, then some sickly sweet malt and alcohol. The heavy but clean mouth is very well carbonated. The taste is best described as honey on bread tainted by a sprinkling of coffee grinds and a splash of pure alcohol. Too sweet, mixed with harsh bitter. While this is not as bad as its Russian cousins, it clearly aspires to join the ranks of the very worst."
"Picked this up at a local store, and did not realize the whole thing with this beer is a ""smoked"" flavor. I can't stand the smoked flavor, so I am trying to be nice, but this just isn't my thing.		Bottle looks old, I feel like I am back in time.		Cracked the bottle, and it literally smells like dip to me. I am scared to drink it. Good pour, nice head, dark color but light at the same time, not a heavy beer.		1st sip, tastes very smokey. Very malty, but nice and light, if they got rid of the smokedness I would probably really dig this beer. I am a little disappointed, but more with myself because I should not have purchased this beer. Seems like other people like it so I think it's just personal preference, but I feel like I am drinking beer, with a BK Smokehouse burger mixed in. Not for me, Sorry. I usually dig the German beer too.		One thing I will say is that the smokey flavor tastes more authentic than I have had in American beers, so they probably did this right."
"12oz bottle poured into a Three Philosophers snifter.		Appearance - Dark ruby brown body. Light brown head.		Smell - Strong coffee. Roasted nuts. Soy sauce. Sadly, this was the best part of the beer.		Taste - Very acidic, watery, and astringent. Stale coffee. 		Mouthfeel - Stale water. The mouthfeel alone is a deal breaker.		Overall Drinkability - Stale coffee watered down. Possibly the least appealing porter I've ever had."
A hazy mid yellow colour with a distinct wheat nose. I found this beer to have a kind of off flavour that made it not very likable. The bottle was fresh from the brewery so I wonder if the beer is always like this. Wouldn't buy it again. Their other beers are so much better.
"Purchased as part of the Kirkland case sampler they've been offering now for some time. I guess if you walk by something often enough you finally bite, that or it was 85 cents a bottle.		The pour is golden with a pancake batter head that fades slowly and leaves some lacing. The smell is rather nondescript. It's not offensive in any way, nor remarkable, watery grain comes to mind. Similarly the taste is..lacking. There is a hint of lemons around the edges, but this is washed away by grain and then a peculiar funk sets in, lingering into the finish, perhaps an effect of the coriander and yeast? Not good."
"Poured from bottle into stein.		A: Pours a rich gold with very little head to speak of, but active bubbles.		S: Aroma is thin, malty. 		T: Taste is bitter, sour, with little of the malt flavor that the aroma promised me.		M: Crisp, active, refreshing. The best part.		D: I won't be drinking this again. Its claim to fame is that it's the granddaddy of all pilsners, but now it's just mediocre to awful. This bottle might be skunked, too. Nice job importing it in green bottles. The bottle proclaims that this is ""how beer is meant to taste."" Yecch."
"Live Review. Poured from the 12 oz. single that I bought at World Wines & Liquor in Mentor, Ohio a few weeks ago for $3.55 into my Cooperstown Beverage Trail pint glass. No observed ""best by"" date.		A 3 inch creamy light brown head over a liquid caramel translucent body. Good look overall and it has that thick, syrupy look of all of the other Old Ales that I have tasted and rated. Edit: bump from 3.5 due to the nice lacing on the inside of the glass. 4.0		S Bready malt sweetness. It is like bread with maple sryup on top with an alcohol scent in the background. Not bad but pretty well in line with other Old Ales that I have experienced. 3.5		T The bread and sweet malt along with a warmth of alcohol show up in the taste just as they did in the taste. This is the classic taste of an Old Ale. 3.5		M Warm, full feeling beer with plenty of syrupy stickiness and depth and breadth. Again here, a fine aspect of the beer but one that I have come across often in the style. 3.5		D Not very drinkable to me with the huge feel (appropriate to the style but huge none the less) and the rather high ABV. 2.0		Notes: Pretty average version of an Old Ale."
"Drinkability is good, specially for those hot days.		A golden colour of course. You can see right throught it but that is expected of a light beer. Little head and no lacing.		It didn't wow me in the smell judging. It smelled like every other beer like it. Hops and barely. Wow. I'm so exicited to drink this. Not.		It tasted like I just had a spoon full of bread. Corn, barely and hops of course but that was it. For a light beer it was actually pretty heavy. But other then that it was a light beer.		In my mouth it was refeshinting, just like water which is what it tasted like. Water. It would be refeshing after I just mowed the lawn or somethign like that but nothing special. 		This is one you would just have for the hot, long days. Maybe if you didn't want to break the bank.		Overall, barely passed. Good for partys in your colllege days. Not so good now."
I have to admit it, like many others, I bought this beer just because of the name. Looked fine, a light amber color. Two finger thick foamy white head that did not go away. Small was soft grainy malt with a honey-like sweetness to it, but with an earth tone as well. The taste was a mix of grain and wheat malt with a touch of honey and caramel, with a hoppy bite at the end. Even with that complexity, I still came away with the feeling that the flavor was a little macro, a little thin. Above average carbonation and a runny mouthfeel. Somewhat of a session beer, worth a try for the gimmick, but if you want a pale ale, I would sample others.
I was really disappointed in this one. I saw this bottle at the store and knew I had to get it. It had a beautiful goden brown color....but a very weak smell and a very weak flavor....felt like I was drinking Coors Light instead. But hey....at least it's another fun bottle to add to my collection.
"Light amber with a thin white head, ok lace		Light citrusy hops with a hint of basil? a touch of pine, malt underneath it all		the grapefruit, pine and basil are all there, but all subdued. Can definitely taste the alcohol, and at 8%, that's a big no-no for me.		just kinda sits in the mouth, and with the alcohol, it's not very pleasant		Not a fun beer to drink, and I won't buy again		Maybe it's old, no dating on bottle that I can see."
You know, i really like the appearance of nitro beers and this is no exception. The pour produced a hazy deep reddish brown beer, with an inch or so of creamy off white head and no visible carbonation. The smell on the other hand was not impressive at all, a slight malt sweetness is barely discernable if anything. The taste is also quite bland, there really seems to not having much going on with this brew. You could taste some malt sweetness, and very little bittering hops, but its all so subdued that the beer seems like it has no character whatsoever. On the positive side however i really enjoyed the mouthfeel, its creamy, and very smooth. Given the right taste the mouthfeel could promote pretty good drinkability, but as it as, the beer is just too bland for me to want to down more than one. Overall, im not very impressed and its unlikely that i'll pick this one up again.
The aroma is right on for the style. It's got coffee, chocolate, toasted malt, and cream. The appearance is dark brow with an almost nonexistent head. The flavor is like the aroma but watery which really hurts it. The palate is way too thin for any kind of beer. Overall it's one of those beers I would rather smell than drink.
Absolutely a horrible beer. I had 12 of these in the fridge my girlfriend bought, and after one, it was time to put my boots on and go out to get something else that night. The flavor is like making a hybrid tea with old cardboard and selzer water - it literally tastes like wet paper mixed with some kind of glue. How they could make a beer this bad and sell it for $9.99 a 6-pack (price at my corner store in Chicago) is truly miraculous. ANY cheap light beer I've tried (Busch, Miller, etc.) is better than this.
"pours a clear pale amber with a thin white head, and not much lacing.		smell of grain, oatmeal, and earth.		taste is watery, grain, and some wheat.		overall not really much to say, the taste was good but the appearance and mouthfeel was not that desirable."
"pours a clear yellowish pale orange with a very nice head. smell is very interesting, i almost don't know what to say about it, it's really weird, it's kind of flowery, but there is this really big aroma of fruity candy, like starburst or something, it's weird and hard to nail down, kinda artificial smelling. Flavor is a weird combination of orange, sugary candy, and bitterness. mouthfeel is mid-range for the style with a low amount of carbination, just a bit of carb bite on the front and then not much left. Meh, i could skip these and not be bummed.		EDIT: after 2 hours i still have the wierdest orange candy flavor in my mouth, and it's awful."
Too sweet for my taste. Poured a clearish-orange color with a small head. Strong pumpkin and squash flavors coming through in the taste and smell. Also very malty with cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice coming through. The mouthfeel is average - smooth with slight carbonation.
"What an interesting example of contrasts - so many things they could have done wrong but didn't and so many things that they didn't quite get right...		The pour is a marvel - this beer is a deep, deep red with touches of brown that perfectly evokes a black cherry soda with a bit of chocolate. A medium cream head sets off the color nicely but falls flat just a bit soon, leaving no lacing on the sides of the glass.		The nose is entirely cherry and chocolate- nothing beer-like to be found. The aromas are mostly dark (bordering on sour) cherry with just a hint of cocoa powder. No malt, no hops to be found.		The flavor is quite interesting and almost a winner (also almost a loser). A less skilled hand would have gone too sweet with this and ended up with a cherry cordial. Instead we have a pretty clean American Brown ale at the base with just a hint of roasted malts and caramel. Unfortunately the cherry is just a bit strong which drowns out the brown ale notes but on the positive side it's hardly a sweet brew. There are some chocolate notes on the finish but this is primarily a black cherry drink.		The mouthfeel is quite good and if there had been more carbonation it would have been excellent. This is a nice light bodied brew and because the brewer shied away from the ""too much sugar"" trap it doesn't have any cloying characteristics muddying up the palate. Not much bittering so the finish is somewhat weak.		I have to give the brewer recognition here for trying... Cherry is a very difficult flavor to get right. The flavor we think of as ""cherry"" in processed foods is entirely artificial and using actual cherries in foods generally doesn't yield cherry-like flavors. (As a matter of fact, by FDA rules the concoction legally referred to as ""Natural Cherry Flavoring"" actually has -no- cherry in it. It is 'natural' - coming from organic origins - and it does taste like cherries but the name is a pure legal technicality) I understand how difficult it is to get a good cherry flavor and I recognize the valiant attempt by O'Fallon. I appreciate that they avoided going ""too sweet"" with the fruit flavor but I still have to recognize that this didn't quite hit the mark."
"This beer is ok but I don't think the style is one that attracts me very much.	Something about the yeast and alcohol mixed with this fruit just made me a little sick.	Taste was ok at first and quickly lost its luster.	Mouthfeel was the strong point of this brew. Good medium body.	Drinkability tapered off quickly."
"A - Pours an opaque dark sienna color with absolutely no head. If I really excite the beer - and I mean practically stick this sucker ion a paint shaker, then I get about a half finger of head. It will leave tiny specks of lacing on the glass.		S - Oak, butter, caramel malt, alcohol and vanilla - in that order.		T - A smokey sweet bourbon oak flavor meshed with a caramel malt. These have a lot of buttery diacetyl and a fair amount alcohol underneath. 		M - Very thick, a little harsh and actually a little parching. (Can something be a little parching?) It has a buttery texture that coats my mouth with a film.		D - I'm not a fan, but it is something I can handle. It isn't a terribly unpleasant experience either. It just isn't for me. I won't have this again. The closest beer I can think to compare this to is Avery's Samael's Oak Aged Ale. This doesn't come close in pleasantness though, it lacks all the pleasant fruit flavors and has a shitload of butter. It also reminds me a bit of Weyerbacher's Prophecy, but not as offensive, at least in my opnion anyway. This is just way too buttery throughout. If you like drinking bourbon butter, then drink this. Otherwise avoid it."
"I heard from somewhere that this was Colin Farell's favorite beer. Well, there is no accounting for taste. 		Simply put: bland and boring. At my first drink, I knew that I wasn't going to like it. My wife told me to stop drinking it if I didn't like it, but I explained to her that if I did that it would be dis-respecting the beer. I wanted to give it my honest opinion. It was bitter and a little too bubbly on the tounge. There wasn't much in the way of taste either. I could taste a musky aroma in my mouth after drinking it that wasn't pleasant either. I wish I could have stopped drinking it, but like I said... that would be dis-respecting the beer."
"Typical Trafalgar offering.		Fizzy cola head on pour, immediately gone, no lace, handsome chestnut colour though. No meaningful aroma or taste. Thin bodied, sparkling, characteristic sourness, understated. Better as it warms, but still unremarkable.		Give it a pass."
"I've had this ale several times in the past and remember it fondly, so I though I'd do a review this time around. In doing so, I learned something about this brew that I hadn't realized before.		As usual this ale poured an ample three fingers of cream colored head which comprised both fine and medium sized bubbles. The head had descent staying power. There was a slight turbidity to the beer with an apparent yeast halo in the glass. There was nice lacing throughout my drinking occasion.		The aroma was of resinous hops, malt and ripe fruit (apricot?).		The flavor was piny hops, fruity yeast, alcohol, brown sugar and bourbon. There is a nice bitter/sweet balance with alcohol and malt sweetness and hop bitterness. The flavor is strong and robust. It is very appealing upfront ... but, there is a very strong bitter aftertaste to this ale which I had never noticed until now. Coming from a person who loves intense IPA's this is an unusual comment.		Drinkability is average to below average due to the aftertaste I previously mentioned. In addition, the ABV. would likely limit mass consumption of this ale at a single seating. Still, not a bad beer to enjoy from time to time."
On-tap at the brewpub. There was a substance to this wit, and a drying peppery corriander taste. A little sweetness and a drop of citrus that gave it acidity. But I could not get at the complexity. The turnover is ferocious here, so I do not suspect it's been about too long.
"12 ounce bottle served in a Sam Adams glass.		Pours a cloudy reddish body, with a 1/4"" head that has a pink tint. The head fades pretty quickly to a super thin film. Tiny dots and short, thin strings of lacing are left behind.		The raspberries have a decent presence in the aroma and taste, though they don't come across as being all that fresh; they're more like condensed frozen raspberry juice that's been chemically preserved. As it nears room temperature, a slight hint of hops and light malt come out.		Medium bodied, with a gentle sweet fruity zing and a decent carbonation tingle that hits the center of the roof of the mouth.		I've really liked all the other Founder's brews, and I really wanted to like this one, but it just had too much of an artificial feel about it for me to really get into."
This beer pours a clear pale straw color with a hint of gold. The head is small, and recedes within seconds into nothing. The aroma is of peaches, and not much else. It smells more like a sweet fruit juice than a beer. The taste is not quite as juicy as the aroma, but it is still of peaches with nothing more to add complexity. The mouthfeel is light bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a mediocre beer. I like fruity wheat beers when they still retain common beer flavor. This beer just tastes like fruit. I will not drink this again.
AIBA 2003: Didn't have any hopes for this one. And i was right, tasteless, fizzy, adjuncty stuff from west Oz. Neither joyous or rewarding or pleasant....or good. Classic adjuncty Aussie midstrength lager, with no ambition other than to have Zero flavour.
Who in their right mind comes up with a beer like this? This beer is punishing to the drinker. Pours a radiant orangish amber color with a small head that did not hang around for long. A little sticky lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is the best thing about this beer. The hops give a big dose of citrus and tropical fruit aromas. There is a lot of alcohol as well giving this beer a rum-like charactor. What can I say about the flavor. One sip and my palate was shredded. The bitterness is extreme and lasts in the aftertaste forever. Combined with the huge alcohol flavor, makes this one tough beer to drink. The hop flavors are lost which is unfortunate. The body does its best to carry the IBUs and alcohol and there is a nice soft carbonation. Good texture. This beer in my opinion is hardly drinkable. Very tough when you have to force yourself to take another sip. Wish I just bought a single, now I have 3 more bottles to force myself through.
"The first time I tried this I was having a variety of styles from Weisen bock, American Strong , IPA's, and Oktoberfests. To say that my palate was polluted is an understatement, so doing a review at the time was unfair. Yesterday evenig was a different story, clear palate clear head.	 The most impressive quality of this brew was the ridiculously foam lacing but for me it was all downhill from there.	 The smell ranged from wet bandaid to soap.	 The taste was nothing special at all , like a lager cut with alchohol. Given a chance to guess the style without knowing anything about it I would NEVER guessed this was an IPA, maybe an out of date Oktoberfest. I honestly choked this one down. I've had their Benchwarmer Porter and really enjoyed it, maybe we got a hold of an out of date batch."
On-tap at West 50 Pourhouse. Red with lace. Sourish, intentional from the yeast? Play taps for this brewery if this is their standard.Fizzy carbonation, lightish body. I was expecting a malty beer. Unfinishable. Different and something went horribly wrong in the lab or in the transport over.
"A: Hazy redish, brown with a 1.5 inch thick and steady head; lacing is decent		S: Sickly sweet cherry and chocolate--hard to get anything else; like chocolate covered cherry candies dumped in the beer; some alcohol presence and maybe some malt characteristics but way too much sweet, sweet, cherry candy		T: Tastes like chocolate covered cherries; some subtle roasted malts; not as sweet as aromas indicated but fairly simple beyond the obvious two flavors		F: Fairly creamy although the beer dissipates off the back of the tongue somewhat unpleasantly		D: Well...it's interesting but way too one dimensional for me; I've had enough"
Got a bottle as a Christmas present and was rightfully leery to try it. Poured a golden orange and head quickly dissipated to nothing. Smells of apple, caramel, malt. Medium-light body. Tastes very malty. Slightly medicinal with apple and banana. Sweet first, then sour and yeasty. Not my style. Drink this if you want to find out what a high gravity Colt 45 would taste like. D
"With ""leaves and flowers of italian Canapa Carmagnola"". (canapa is hemp).	Light yellow greenish appearance, hazy. Average compact head, quite creamy.	Fresh smell, light, lemony. Some herbal notes, quite peculiar, probably from the canapa (it seems something like rucola).	The taste is too citric. It is light, drinkable, refreshning, but in the end, not completely satisfating.	Light in body. Citrousy aftertaste, lemony, and canapa (likely). In some points it can remember by far a witbier without spices.	The other beers from Zahre are better."
"330 ML poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass		A-- Poured a dark golden straw yellow. Medium to high carbonation by appearance, lots of bubbles. Bright cloud white head that was one finger. Decent head retention and some soapy like lacing on the sides of the glass. Do not think this is a bock at all.		S-- Heavy corn presence right off the bat. Very big chemical smell. A little bit floral and sweet as well. Very much not a bock.		T-- Sweet and almost syrupy. A little bit of a floral taste but otherwise it tastes like a run of the mill offering that is a bit more pimped out. 		M-- Very little bitterness and ABV is noticeable in the mouth. A little bit creamy and more on the medium side of carbonation. Very sweet and perfume like. Does have a bit of a heavy finish. Sounds like a lager to me 		D-- Basically a suped up lager that is not that great or worthy of having with good tapas. Skip and find something more interesting to have than this.		Not going to fail it even though as a bock it would get an F. As a lager or a pilsner it is barely passable"
"MARKETING... This beer is the result of ingenious marketing. Since Kentucky is home of the Kentucky Derby and Lexington is a widely recognized horse capital, the marketers of this beer capitalize on the horse theme and the novelty approach to put out a substandard beer, sell it at a premium and, hopefully lure a few suckers into buying their beer. IT WORKED ON ME. The label offers NO INFORMATION as to what to expect.... doesn't even say if this is a lager or an ale. I have tried some of Bluegrass Brewing Company's (BBC) beers and enjoyed them.... so, noting that this Horse Piss is brewed by BBC, I picked up a 4-pack ($6.99) with hopes that this would be a decent brew. I was disappointed.		I poured the contents of the brown bottle into a pint glass and watched the white foam rise to about 1-1/2"" of loose bubbles and immediately settle back to nothing in a matter of a minute of so. The liquid is a pale yellow that has an odd cloudiness that is the result of an ultra-fine particulate matter that has not been filtered from the beer.		The smell is a light toasted malt. Smells like a typical macro lager... nothing special.		The taste is light, watery toasted malt with a bit of a smoky character.		Mouthfeel is typical macro... too fizzy, watery, thin.		Drinkability: I'll have to pawn the remaining three beers I have off on some macro-loving friends that come over during the holiday season... I sure don't care to have this again... NOT a funny joke. At $6.99 a four pack, I feel like a sucker... raped and freezin'... leaves a bad taste in my mouth for Bluegrass Brewing."
Straw yellow colour topped by a thin lace of fine bubbles that didn't cover the whole top of the beer. Carbonation was evident by the profusion of bubbles rising to the surface. DMS and stale lager hop aroma. Very muted flavour reflected the aroma, but with an additional grain husk character. Very light body and high carbonation, with a texture close to that of water. Slight bitter aftertaste.
"Pours a light golden yellow with just a bit of cloudiness. 2 fingers of fluffy head.		Smell is light yeast and clove, a bit less funkiness than I would expect from the style but still decent overall.		The taste, however, isn't quote what I would call ""decent."" Somewhat offensive, actually. There is a nice expected funkiness present but underneath is a bit of sourness that doesn't work.		Mouthfeel is normal for the style, but this just isn't drinkable because of the odd sourness."
"Nice light orange in color with a pleasant, bubbly head. It looked rather nice...		Next to nothing on the aroma. Deep breaths brought up faint spice. 		Initially I'm hit with this odd note of lemon zest. It was almost tart, ruining the rest of the notes. Not that the rest of it was anything to write home about: Slight spice notes with a predominant bread character. 		Feel was a little more redeeming; smooth and creamy, upper-light body. 		Too off to make this easy to put away."
"I was disappointed with this beer.  I guess I bought in to the TV adds, so Amstel, you got my $9.99 for this 12/pk, but don&#8217;t look for any more.  Skunky smell hits you before the beer ever reaches the mouth.  Then the skunk smell carries over to the taste, and I swear if I didn&#8217;t pour it myself, I would have thought I was drinking an aged Schlitz."
"12oz brown bottle. Deep dark brown, ruby hued. Healthy off-white head that clings to a thin lace.		Toasty, brown bread malt in the nose with grainy biscuit. Faint acrid roastiness.		Light-bodied, tight carbonation on the palate prickles. Toasty malt characters, soft, but there. Dulled, subdued sweetness. The acrid roastiness is there too, lending a bit of depth, but its smoothed in and subtle. Touch of metallic. Light hop bitterness blended in with the roastiness, it spikes the palate quickly, then retreats. Toasty bready finish that increasingly dries. Flavorless grainy feel on the palate.		A bit one-dimensional, but still a bit enjoyable in its simplicity. That said, it's a bit too dull to keep you interested ... like the malts were purely used for color. C'mon ... work those malts!"
"Black with huge head that makes pouring this beer take about 10 minutes. Very soap-sudsy looking foam that is not appetizing. Strike one.		Milky-sweet aroma with thin roasted notes. A bit harsh. Ball one.		Taste is a lot of things, none of which are good. This is hard to describe because there is no chocolate, no coffee, no hops, no caramel, no anything very recognizable. I keep thinking of a bar of soap when I drink it, though it seems strange. Dirty minerally astringent water would be my best explanation. Strike two.		Mouthfeel is godawful. Huge carbonation and thin body with dirty bitter finish. STRIKE THREE, YOU""RE OUT!"
"First of all, not what I was expecting for a Belgian Quad. 		A-Pours like a barleywine with a copperis body and absolutely no head. The body appears with a syrupy, candy slickness. 		M-Not much detected other than fusel alcohol. A harsh acetone smell fills the nose if a deep whiff is taken.		T-Much more like a belgian barleywine to me. (That sounds like a great next homebrew to try!) The spicy hops fight with the strong Belgian yeast strain. A coarse hop flavor finishes with a pseudo-sweet taste. Somewhat medicinal in taste, but not as bad as it probably sounds.		M-This is not a terrible beer, but the harsh finish leaves the tongue like sandpaper. The bittering hops come on too strong for this type of style. 		D-High in alcohol and lots of taste, but nothing here blends that well. I wanted a much heavier malt presence in this and it was a bit thin and overboard. 		Maybe I am being too hard on this beer, but true quadrupel fans will, most-likely, be disappointed in this attempt by a great brewery."
"I drank this from the bottle into a pint glass.		The beer pours a light orange with a tan head ok retention, light lacing.		The aroma was very strong of pumkpin and nutmeg. 		The taste was ok, a little to strong on nutmeg almost makes you gap until you've had a few drinks and you're used to it. The mouthfeel is heavy but not highly drinkable."
They asked if I wanted a lemon. I refused reflexively, though this one might have benefited from a squirt of citrus. Or anything. White Water is dense sandalwood colored. It reveals a modest sweetness, but the usual adjectives of dry, crisp and refreshing are not forthcoming. Try blas, timid, and lacking authority. It just sits there like a statue of a glass of beer. No head. No lace. And no flavor worth commenting on. I'd even call it uncarbonated. No thanks.
Poured a cloudy yellow/gold with less than a finger of white, poor retention, and spotty lacing. Couldn't get much from the nose aside from some lemon, grass, hay, and a modest herbal presence. The taste confirmed this, with very little in the way of the citrus, peel, or spice that I have become accustomed to in wits. Very thin, with little carbonation. In a nutshell, not a fan.
The head had subsided before the pint had even been served to me. The color is a cloudy deep red that is almost brown. The aroma is of sweet malt with a touch of noble hops. Flavor is very clean with a maltiness that is matched by the hops, yet both are very mild. Mouthfeel is very thin and this beer is pretty watery for a Red. No bitterness from the hops or the malt is detected and i must say this beer is very boring. Overall i would rather walk to the liquor store and buy whatever was in the case than this beer.
"Stoudts Blonde Double Mai-bock	12 oz bottle	Brewed Spring 05, drank 09/06		Poured a clear flat amber with an average rocky white mostly diminishing head with good lacing.		Smelt of moderate grain with hints of pine and grapefruit and a hint of sweat.		Taste was upfront light sweet bread and slight bitterness followed by a heavily bitter and lightly sweet and acidic grapefruit rind, with a pinch of spice, in an average length finish. Mouthfeel was light to medium, watery and heavily astringent with soft carbonation.	 	Overall, a beer that probably lost its roundness and taste with age.		Notes: will have to rerate a fresh batch."
"I slowly poured the beer into the pilsner glass and watched as the head came up to a nice 1-inch firmness. The color of the beer surprised me with its rich golden yellow color. Micro-bubbles percolated from below. There was hardly any aroma to be had but I couldn't wait to dive into this rich looking pool of beer. Curious. The carbonation bubbles dwindled off to a few trickles like street traffic at 3 a.m.		The first sip attacked my taste buds with meaning. Full flavor, a nice middle and a crisp ending similar to the crack of a bullwhip. This is definitely a European beer. The flavor is what I'd imagine Old World beer would taste like. The taste is a bit sharper than what I remember Bitburger to be, but this is good drinking nonetheless. The hoppiness of this brew is obviously its trademark. It's not too much to put you off, but it does make its presence clear right from the beginning.		By the second bottle, the tastes settled down and played nice. A bit of sweetness stepped forward. The hoppiness went from a whipcrack to rough butt pinch. My mouth wanted another sip strictly due to the flavor. The hops demanded that I reply, ""Thank you, sir. May I have another?""		The taste of this beer is most probably at extreme end of the hoppiness scale that my taste buds could tolerate. Hoppier than a lager, but much less so than an IPA. Not one sip caused me to wrinkle my brow with distaste, but each sip did take whack at my uvula on the way down. In my opinion, this would be a good beer right after a meal of meat. A thick juicy steak and some P.U. would probably hit it off pretty well together.		If you're shopping for a good tasting beer, pass this one by. Some guys are hopheads who love the punishment of these hoppy beers. Others, like me, want some good taste without paying another price for the same beer."
Poured a dark amber color, darker than most DIPA's, with a one finger foamy head. Decent lacing in the glass. When you smell this beer, you get hops and more hops, with that citrus and grass background. On my first taste, my mouth slightly tingled from the bitterness, but as you progress, the bitterness is manageable. Huge hops taste and bitterness all the way down the mouth and throat, never ending. Mouthfeel was good, but other than my first taste, nothing remarkable. Drinkability is low for me for a few reasons. First, the price for a bomber is simply ridiculous. I tried one being curious about 168 IBU's. The taste is not as good as others of this style (IMO), and costs double. With this bitterness, I would call it a one and done anyway.
"This beer was poured into a pint glass from the 22oz bomber.		The beer pours a cloudy copper amber with a frothy off white head that erupts easily to a two finger that holds nicely and leaves a lot of lace. Clarity of a beer is not super important to me, so I can't say here that I should dock it many points for this.		The aroma of the beer is all hops. Floral aromas dominate, but spicy aromas are right there. Piney and citrus aroma linger in the background as well.		The flavor of the beer is up front with a grassy vegetal hop flavor. This is followed by piney, spicy, and floral hops. A subtle matlyness lingers throughout.		The body is mendium-full with a lively carbonation. There is a significant dryness in the finish too		Overall, the grassy, leafy hop characteristic takes this one way over the top and makes it quite unbalanced."
"Chilled bomber into a glass. I can't for the life of me remember who sent this. Whoever you are, please BM me so I can give you credit. I should track my trades better. What I do remember is that it cost about $17 in trade (shows you where my priorities are, heh). 		Anyway, I appreciate having the chance to try this. 		A: Pours an opaque black body with a short-lived mocha head. The bubbles vanish into nothing; the beer looks completely still and leaves no lacing down the sides. 		S: Lots. Of. Whiskey. I'm one of those guys that likes a little more balance; the base beer should hold up well against the barrel. It smells like the barrel won, here. I still get the base beer, with a rummy sweetness, chocolate, roasted malt, and molasses. 		T: See above. Whiskey starts the taste, and it nearly pushes the beer into being over-sweet; with the molasses, chocolate, vanilla, and some raisins, I'm a little taken aback with how saccharine it is. The finish tips it slightly toward balance by bringing in some oaky astringency and coffee, but it's fighting a losing slide into sweetness. Which is what you'd expect from the style, admittedly -- but it doesn't stand far above the middle. 		M: Very smooth and creamy, and I'm reminded that this is the oatmeal contribution. Low-carbed, but it goes down with a velvety presence. A small booziness. Quite nice. 		D: Independent of price, this isn't in the upper-tier of barrel-aged imperial stouts. At $17 a pop I'm just going to ignore it."
"A 500ml bottle with a BB of July 2012. ABV is stated as 4.7%.		Poured into a Sam Smith's pint glass. A clear orange-amber hue with good carbonation. Forms a small off-white head that lasts for a minute or so before disappearing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt with notes of toffee, butterscotch and stewed hops. A hint of diacetyl and a whiff of alcohol in the background.		Tastes of caramel malt with a lingering bitter finish. Notes of toffee, brown sugar and stewed leaves, followed by a harsh bitterness. A whisper of diacetyl in the background. Mouthfeel is rather thin, with tingly carbonation and considerable astringency. Aftertaste of bitter stewed leaves.		A seriously underwhelming Christmas ale with a weak and unpleasant character. Lots missing from this one; more malt and a sweeter, fruitier, spicier flavour. The harsh bitterness can go as well. Not impressed - a beer to avoid."
"The colour is pale brown; the liquid clear. The low off white head slowly sinks down slowly, leaving some lacing. Too pale		The smell is mild. Butter, semi-sweet malt and some earthy hints. 			The taste is earthy, roasted with lots of diacetyl. I found some notes of hazelnuts and dough. The aftertaste is malty and a bit dry.		The carbonation is quite mild; lots of small bubbles. The liquid is a bit viscous.		The fact that a Danish major makes a Dunkel is interesting. The beer isnt."
"Wow. Infected? Maybe. hard to tell.		Dark fruits, malt and it seems like the intention was to kick out a killer, robust, islay malt Scotch Ale - but we're well into sour territory and the hop-forward, roasty char is not helping anything.		I can kind of taste where they were heading but sadly it's too sour and possibly infected to finish or know for sure. The carbonation is too present and acrid.		Sad. Loads of promise here."
Bought a bottle of this last week, looks to have a best buy date of 8/22/05, very nice. Pour is a light golden, the head was of the beaten egg white quality and did a good job of sticking around. This beer was kind of a mixed bag for me, I popped it open while I started cooking, so I took sips every five minutes or so while I had a moment. Each sip was different. The first actually had a bit of a sour quality, and I thought, please get better soon. Actually, it's still evident 30 minutes later. There are some more pleasant things going on: it is pretty citrusy in the finish. I actually find it bit sweet too. Sitting here drinking this one in front of the computer, I have to say it's a bit of a mish-mash. I guess I need to get another bottle and see if there is a change for a better drinking experience.
"Saw this on the shelves at the bottle shop, have yet to try a ""Mexican craft beer,"" figured I'd give it a go.		Poured into a tulip pint: Half-finger of nicely formed, creamy, khaki head over brown that's dark enough to round up to black, with nice plum highlights.		Hmm, signs of infection here? Tart green apple & cherry smell. That's really about all I'm getting.		Same in the taste, with a roasty/astringent underpinning. Ends with a metallic tap water kind of taste. *shudder*		Medium-thin, astringent, metallic. Not real good.		And we have a winner! I'm assuming this bottle was infected, having some real problems here. Don't know if the problem was in the handling - it was kept at room temperature - though it was in brown glass with no date, so I'm gonna hold the brewer responsible for this one. I'd be willing to try it again, if I could be assured a good bottle, but this isn't happening."
"Presentation: Thanks go out to DoctorDog for this unusual gift. At first glance I thought it said Cherry Chocolate Stout, but upon pouring it and seeing the light color, I see it is Cherry Chocolate Beer. Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a shaker pint glass. Label is red with 3 cherries on the front. No obvious freshness dating.		Appearance: Pours with two fingers of light tan head. This settles to a thin yet complete layer of foam. The beer itself is a hazy and dull dark amber. Some viscous sludge remains in the bottle.		Smell: Strong notes of bitter baker's chocolate with hints of cherry.		Taste: Tootsie roll like chocolate upfront followed by a slightly tart cherry bite with mild undertones of sweetness. Both the cherry and chocolate flavors seems artificial.		Mouthfeel: Higher than average carbonation. Body is kind of thin.		Drinkability: Well, it tastes like exactly what it says it it, can't fault them for that. However, this just doesn't do it for me. The base beer seems to light in flavor to take the cherry and chocolate. I know I wouldn't have another one and I am not even sure I can finish this one."
"This is the second self-proclaimed ""Triple IPA"" I have had; the first being a fresh offering from Boston Beer Works. I hope it can stack up, because the Beer Works edition was potent and tasty.		Poured into a Sam Adams glass.		Pours amber, almost orange with a bit of cloudiness. The head falls quickly, and the lacing is reasonable.		Aroma is fruity, and packs a wallop. Very nice, tart fruitiness stings the sinuses with each whiff. This is the first brew since Heady Topper that I could practically smell from across a room. Woah.		Taste is where the rubber meets the road. Too bad this one veers off onto a crowded sidewalk. All indications were that this was going to be a bitter, fruity, slightly sweet bomb of hoppy goodness. What it is is almost indescribable. But I will try. It is phenomenally dry and bitter, but that's where the fun ends for the hop heads. Personally, booziness is quite welcome in all of my beers, but this one is just a smidge over-the-top. The flavor is what I would imagine an onion-flavored dip tobacco would taste like. Quite off-putting.		There is a battle in the flavor between three extremes- booze, bitter, and a bizarre hop profile. In this battle, there are no winners.		The mouthfeel is sticky and slick. This brew does have some density to it. It's interesting to watch the carbonation bubble up to the top, struggling to push it's way through a syrupy top layer.		Man, this is just a strange beer. If I tried this blindfolded at a beerfest, I would probably guess it was either experimental or a cruel joke. I certainly don't care for this brew, but I am wracking my brain to come up with some redeeming quality. Perhaps some kind of tangential use for the brew? Paint thinner? Mace?		In all seriousness, this is just too much of too many things. I'm impressed that such a flavor could be teased out of malt and hops, but that doesn't make it good. Save your money, because you'll drop some serious pocket change on this one."
Let me start off by saying this beer was quite skunky. Perhaps i just got a bad six pack, who knows, but this six pack is what i have to judge by. The first sip brings a slight hop flavor, and mild spice, but the aftertaste was very bad, again this may be due to the bottle being exposed to too much light, im not sure. The smell of this beer was quite average. Overall from my experience, i wouldnt buy this beer again. It is not much better than some of the macro's. or yuppie beers (heiniken) out there.  I will most likely try this beer on tap at a bar just to be sure if it was the bottles i had.
"Pours a not so pale amber. No head after a hard pour. Not lifeless, but certainly dull. No lace. It looks like rusty tea, or that time I peed blood. 		Bread and butter aroma, with a little pungent yeasty fruit after swirling so hard I spilled.		Almost has ""that homebrew taste"". Sweet cereal, a bit of weedy hops, leading to a grainy and unsatisfying finish. 		Mouthfeel was the highlight because it was the only part of this beer I don't have to think about.		Bluh."
"The Crap-in-a-Can-Crusade continues!		Where did this come from, hell if I know. Some random dingy liquor store i'm guessing. ""OCT3111"" on the bottom of the can.		Pale gold, slowly receding head of white soapy foam, rapid trails of rising carbonation. When backlit, the glass shows some suspended micro-sediment. Thin skim across the surface and even a little bit of lacing here and there. 		Dishrag smell, musty and minerally, raw sweet corn, wet grains. 		Ooof. Alcohol shows up on the first couple swigs, dull malt sweetness, dusty stale stick of gum from a baseball card pack. Grapey wine yeast. Harsh astringency, medium bodied with lower carbonation. Gross sticky saccharine aftertaste, bad taste and bad decisions. This ain't good. Had worse, but this is somewhere in the lower echelon. 		St. Ides, gets your jimmy thicker...	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcZ3Fs9758E"
"Fairly close to black with a fluffy dark tan head. With a stout on nitrogen it would have been good to see a more dense head, or to get the beer while there were still nitrogen bubbles happening, but I saw it as it was poured, and no such action.		Not much at all on the nose. Very light, but with a bit of a cloying medicinal sweetness mixed with some chalky black malt to the taste, not terrible, but not enjoyble either. Better than some others that I have suffered through on this sad journey with few highlights.		Not very drinkable. A bit bloating.		Note to the brewers: A stout is about more than color."
"Thanks to rmasen for this one; I had been looking forward to it ever since I'd tried Pch Mortel.		Pours a completely opaque black with a small ochre head that recedes to leave some nice lacing. Smells of thoroughly roasted malt; so roasted in fact that there's no real conventional malt taste. It's essentially all bitter coffee with faint chocolate notes. Burnt, bitter flavors dominate the taste with gobs of coffee and some dark cacao. Earthy character with an astringent finish. As hard as it is for an RIS to be unbalanced, this one is; a dry stout beefed up with spent Folger's grinds. It does have a thick feel, but it's too oily to be a real positive. Definitely a sipper. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this was disappointing."
"Pours a dark amber, with a small foamy head. The nose was pleasant, with just a hint of the woody, porky smokiness to come.		I like pork and smoked beers as much as the next guy, but the aftertaste was reminiscent of day old bacon grease. I felt it really masked any other flavors in the brew, so much as to be a distraction. There were hints of a larger flavor profile, but whamo!, bacon.		Thanks to Eric for buying a whole pitcher..."
"Sampled on 7-4-10	L.77249 printed on the label.		Pours a clear amber/red color with almost no head at all. The bubbles that are there quickly dissipate, leaving a clean surface with no lacing.		Smell is all sweet malt and booze, with subtle caramel aromas much like a doppelbock. Not any more complex than this, and clearly for one purpose.		Taste is exactly what you'd expect, very sweet with a sizable alcohol kick. The caramel flavor adds a surprising redeeming quality, but can only do so much.		Mouthfeel is thick, syrupy, and almost flat. Fitting.		Drinkability is okay, but it's really just malt liquor.		Overall, at $2.50 for 16oz, I got my money out of it."
"The label said ""Porter"" but it's actually a lager. It pours a nice clear medium amber, more like a fine ale than a lager, with a decent off-white head. Aroma is crisp and malty, typical for a lager. Flavor is rather sweet and fruity, just a little malty. Texture is quite smooth and hardly fizzy at all."
"This is a 500 mL bottle of Holy Grail Ale, poured into an Ommegang Witte glass. The ale is slightly below room temperature.		Appearance: The ale is a light brown color, clear with no haze.		Smell: The ale smells of an earthy hop and biscuity malt.		Taste: The malts are sweet and overpower the hops. There is a slight acidic taste at the end of each sip.		Mouthfeel: The malts and hops do not mix well, creating a conflict on the palate.		Drinkability: I'd pass on this one."
I enjoy the Damm Good Beer commercials but thats about all. I'm sure that Amsterdam isn't that proud of this beer. Anyway this was probably one of the first imported beers I ever had and honestly it wasn't anything to really brag about. This beer pours out as a pale yellow with a little head on top. The aroma is basically just a malt based brew. Not much to pick out really. The taste is the same as the aromas. Not a whole lot going on here. It's drinkable but that's all.
My goodness... this was a terrible beer. Its pale, Bud Lite-watery appearance is well matched to its pale, ricey, Bud Lite-watery taste. Its mild detergent smell reminds me of the summer beers from Sam Adams, and also of the days long ago when I would rise very early on a Sunday morning, say goodbye to my wife and tote several bags of laundry to the laundromat where, for two hours, I would sit and inhale the dust from old boxes of Tide and Cheer. It was bad then and it's bad now, especially in beer. Ick.
"Appearance: Poured this from a bottle; clear golden color with a decent sized head.		Smell: Hints of high school locker room and warm slippers. Detected some flatulent undertones.		Taste: Sweet; almost like an echo of honey BBQ, taste did not linger long		Mouthfeel: Very light, medium carbonation, pretty average		Drinkability: I'm not very impressed with this beer. My friends thought I was joking when I said I could smell fart funk in my cup before I started drinking it. 		Verdict: Tasted better than it smelled, would bring it to a party as a joke for my friends to smell."
"200ml bottle.		 Poured a orange-red lightly clouded ale in the snifter...small cap that goes fast, not much lace. 		Aromas of molasses, some dried fruit and musty yeast tones. 		Malting supplimented with a lot of demerara gives a slick mouthfeel and a boozy sharp ""young"" character.		 Starts sweet and vinous like a sturdy port then the alcohol is detected and it wipes out much of the fruit tones that were developing...finished rather harsh with licorice-salt tastes and a long after burn. 		It is too early to rate this ale it needs some cellar time to see more flavors develop and the sharp 2 dimentional flavor to mellow into something warming and more flavorful. I put a couple of bottles down and will review again in a year."
"Had a snifter of this one a couple days ago at the CBC. Here's my notes from the back of my coaster:		""App: Tawny w/ warm orange-brown hue, no lacing.		Nose: Wow! Pumpkin - nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, dulche de leche.		Palate: Spicy texture w/ prickly alc. Medium-sweet - the spices dominate and the hops clean up the finish w/ nice bitterness. Almost no carbonation.		Notes: A solid beer, very spicy though. I wish more b.w. (Barley-wine) showed through. The bitter finish is appreciated. B+""		Looking back on it, it was rather sweet, but the spices tampered that fact. Also, I'm proud of myself for picking out the spices without consulting the description on the menu! Glad my expensive wine education is paying off!"
"Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale is a clear amber color with low carbonation and a small cap. 		smells of sweet buttery malt, and maybe a touch of english hops.		the taste of buttery, fruity malt is strong, followed by a hint of earthy hops. some diacetyl and apple/pear fruitiness carries on after the swallow.		i wish the tastes were more apparent. it's a decent if average english ale, though. 		the mouthfeel is clean, with low carbonation, fairly full mouthfeel.		i would possibly drink this again. it's not my first choice, as english ales rarely are, but it's definitely quaffable. i expected something much worse considering the cheesy Monty Python theme."
"Pours dark amber with little head. Aroma is first and primarily coriander, followed by pine and coriander, the citrus and coriander, then fruit and more coriander. Taste follows through in the same manner. I had a great coriander-free moment at the swallow, but then it sadly came back. Mouthfeel is rich and viscous, damn nice.		Please people! When using spices, keep it subtle. It's killing what could be a VERY promising beer. I want to like this, really, but with all the spice, I just can't get behind it. I give the taste a 3.5 (should be alot lower) as it could be a damn good beer if the dang coriander and spice was less prominent, but as of now it's just too domineering of a presence. Perhaps time will be good to this and the coriander ages out, as I have 1 of these in the cellar. We'll see in a year or more."
"Poured into pint glass from 12oz bottle...		A- Nice black color with brown edges and a finger caramel colored head. Great stability for an imperial stout. 		S- Overall a light aroma. The most I get is a oaty and cereal type of smell. Shy coffee aroma plays hide and seek but no strong roasted barley in this stouts nose.		T/M- Waaay too alcoholic. Very hot. Ethanol. Gasoline. Some roast. A slight smooth oatmeal stout does say hi right once it hits your tongue- then BAM! Alcohol... Just can't get behind it. Very smooth and slick mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation keeps it lively; which may or may not be a good thing.		O- I am not talking alcohol like a nice barrel aged beer alcohol- no, this is a stout mixed with straight vodka/rubbing alcohol. I plan to get some more and sit on this for a year or two; may work wonders because this has potential..."
"Devil Dancer Triple IPA 13 % ABV . Label is colored a reddish /auburn hue . There is a woman who is being held by the Devil no doubt with orange flames comming from underneath . Smell is some hops and very "" boozy "". Alcohol aroma is very prominent . On the tongue it is hot and intense . As the alcohol warms it is not very pleasant . The lacing in nice to look at all over the glass . Few more sips solidifies my thoughts that this is just too boozy , medicinal . Booze bomb that is harsh , thick , and just not worth trying again . The Devil Dancer will leave your throat and mouth with an oily fire ."
"Way too sweet. 	I am really starting to believe that America is the beer capital of the world. We didnt invent it, we just perfected it! I had high hopes for this beer but it stuck in my mouth and took several glasses of water to thin in out! 	wont try again		Alcohol well hidden by the overpowering sweetness		Color was good but for my American palate this beer fell way short"
"Another winner from Bluegrass.	A-Brown, Yes, this ""imperial stout"" is a clear brown color, not opaque and nowhere near black. If you showed it to me in the glass and told me nothing about it, I'd call it a nut brown ale. It has a fizzy head, which is odd for an imperial stout but doesn't look out of place here, because this beer doesn't look like an imperial stout, or any stout for that matter.	S- This beer smells caramelly with no real roasted, oak, or bourbon notes. For supposedly being a stout, it has failed the smell and appearance test. Boring is a word that comes to mind when I think of this one.	T/M- No roasty, coffee, or chocolate notes here, kids, just a shitty caramel flavor with some faint, with an emphasis on""faint"", bourbon notes. The body is thin, and the beer has as much carbonation as any pop, which makes it seem even thinner. The flavor is sweet and shitty. There are no redeeming qualites in this beer. Let me hammer this into the ground one last time- this is not a stout. It tastes as if somebody brewed a mediocre brown ale and diluted it by 50% with water. 	O- This beer is not only a waste of my time but a waste of grain, hops, and water. If it were from another brewery, I might be let down, but since it is from Bluegrass, it's exactly what I would expect-GARBAGE. Bluegrass, please stop making your shitty beer; it consumes shelf space at liquor stores that could be occupied by any other microbrewery's product, which could never suck as bad as the swill you continually pump out. Can I please have my money back?"
"I sampled this at the Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Fest.		A: Raspberry red, slightly pink head, no retention or lace.		S: Raspberry bubblegum is intense (and seems fake), cotton candy.		T: Tarte raspberry, fairly dry, a little bread, fake raspberry bubblegum.		M: Full body is creamy. Carbonation is light to moderate.		D: Chick drink?		I'm going against the grain... I just didn't like this one."
"In Denmark, beer is sometimes classified by the colour of the label. A golden label indicates that the AVB is approx 5.5-6.5%.		The colour is 	medium yellow. The two finger head is white and compact. No lacing.		The smell is sweet and chemical. I found notes of honey, dough, pulp and a hint of apricot brandy.		The taste is also quite sweet with notes of pastry, honey and almonds. The body is low. The aftertaste is medium long and sweet (almost like saccharine) with hints of dough. No bitterness at all.		The carbonation is a little bit below the average. Medium sized bubbles. 		Geee another worthless Danish low-budget lager."
"Recieved as a joke sort of I guess from the shotgun BIF. I had really never had much from them, but being this is one of my favorite styles what the heck right? Served cold and poured into a pint glass, this one was consumed on 08/30/2009.		The pour was off from the start, small tan head which faded almost instantly was replaced by only the slightest bit of lacing on the sides of the glass, which itself faded momentarily leaving behind only a bare, brown liquid. Aroma was a mess, wet carbonard, hints of caramel were muted and astringent. A touch of tannic flavors welcomed me, or scared me away, It was just all over. Watery flavor, thin and flat feel, nothing redeeming it at all. Small touch of caramel, maybe at the end of it, but really just shocked by how off this one was. No sign of alcohol or depth in the body.		Overall the worst scotch ale I have ever had. I am really shocked to be honest as well. It was just all over the place and way too thin for the style. I was expecting average but did not even get that. Not sure whats going on but I would not go here again."
Pours a clean reddih/ orange color with a light pinkish head. In the aroma, a small tart raspberry fruitiness. In the taste, small tart, and small raspberry fruitiness, yet quite clean. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, small raspberry aftertaste. Kind of faint flavors, and a nice small tartness, ok, but expecting more flavor.
Pours dark golden, fairly opaque. Pours with a nice head that dissipates and even fairly decent carbonation does not support. Initial smell is floral and even smells like green apples. Feels almost like a wheat beer, tastes like apples too, but less than the smell. Kind of hoppy, but not too much. Aftertaste is gone quickly. I don't like either the apple smell/taste or the hops. I didn't finish it because the apples annoyed me halfway through it and it turned out to be just too hoppy the more I drank.
"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a clear pint glass. Bottled on date on front label. Single purchased at Market Street Wineshop (Charlottesville, VA) for $1.40.		A: Clear tangerine hue with 1-2 finger foamy sandy colored head with average retention and some lacing.		S: Aroma is of some roasted caramel and pale malts with minimal herbal hops bitterness.		T: The flavor is metallic and off with some bland roasted caramel and pale malt flavors that don't approach bready followed by sour and metallic, aspirin notes that leave no trace of bitterness. Not even close to style.		M: The mouthfeel is thin and watery with no personality. Afteraste is chalky.	 	D: A definite skip. Not really sure what they are going for in calling it both an ""amber"" and ""German style altbier"" at the same time. This brew is not a good stab at either one."
"Had this one in its 22 ounce bottle. Very, very thick looking double IPA. At first glance, it looked like something I would have to eat with a spoon. You really can't see through its very dark brown-orange-amber appearance. The head thinned away and left some creamy lacing, however. Pungent aromas of citrus, hops and grains. Has somewhat of sweetness to it but the ripeness is way too strong. The taste is like the smells: it has some potential and even some attractive qualities, but it does live up to its ""mean"" status. Way too bitter and sour with a over-riped fruit feel to it. The mouthfeel is way too heavy for a double IPA. This drink lacks a crisp resfreshingness and merely enhances the problems with it. Overall, its not too bad but its overtness in flavor and texture leaves this as a drink once kind of beer."
"500ml bottle poured into pint glass july20 2010		A clear golden yellow with lots of bubbles and a fast falling fingers worth of head that left no lace		S corn syrup and a little skunk		T not much improvement in flavor almost tastes like a mouthful of pennies 		M fairly thin but well carbonated pretty average in this department		D not so great flavor is never a good thing, I doubt I'll drink this again		I've had a number of Polish lagers recently and this may be the first one I wouldn't drink again"
A sweet, dark beer with almost no head. Coffee flavor was pronounced. My wife even said it smelled like coffee and she was across the table. I got no chocolate flavor, but the roasted malt was kind of sweet and bitter. Mighty tasty, but hard to have more than one and then go walk in the blistering Florida heat.
"The color is a typical pale yellow. There's little head or lacing.	The aroma is weak grains, some skunk, and corn.	The flavor's the same. Bland, skunky, husky...although it seems perhaps an effort was made with some hops. Weak, though.	Mouthfeel is thin, watery, and a little over-carbonated, with even less of the crispness that at least some macro lights have.	Nothing to it, really."
"Got this on tap @ sunset grill and tap in Brighton.		Poured a deep dark brown with a very small head that simmered into almost no lacing		Smelled extremely malty and oak-y. Extreme malt smells, with some hints of alcohol. Hops are practically non-existent		Tastes great. I don't have much experience with Old Ales (save for Ola Dubh), but I'd imagine they would taste very similar to this. Very, very malty...probably caramal malts that have turned into a very unique taste with age....very very woody, oak-y taste dominates the pallate. No hops here. I liked the old flavor very much. It tastes musty-- like an old attic would smell like (if you could imagine). The 10% abv is well-hidden by the way		Mouthfeel was good, a little oily, but I'd imagine thats what the style is supposed to be		drinkability is pretty bad. the beer tastes great, i just could'nt imagine coming back for more....especially at 8.99 a 13ouncer		Overall- I was gonna get this, but at 15 bucks a 4 pack-- I backed off. I had to get it when I saw it on tap. I'd say definitely get it if you see it on tap, but don't bother getting a 4 pack....unless you love old ales..."
"A - Crystal clear, a very dark yellow (almost golden). A nice eggshell head but it dies to nothing incredibly quickly. 		S - The aroma is very faint. There is some very light graininess, a hint of bitter hops, but it's all very faint.		S/M - Much sweeter than I expected. An almost apple juice like flavor with a very bitter finish. The finish is a little off putting. 		D - This isn't terrible, but not something I would drink again."
"I've been steamed lately that this Polish brewer's fine Porter is no longer being produced, but, however, they are happy to provide us with their ""malt liquor."" Is it worthy? Let us see...	Appearance: pale yellow, highly carbonated, with a beautifully fluffy, cloudish head.	Aroma: a bit sour, lemony, notes of straw, minerals, metal.	Taste: utterly blase', missing just about everything I'd think would be required in order to provide flavor. If any exists, it's utterly inevident to me, I'm drawing blanks, as I sip from this tall glass of nothing.	Short finish, bland, flat character.	Further in, sweetish notes arise, but feeling thoroughly on the cornish side.	Lack of body, malt, hops, anything at all, gives little to redeem this hopeless brew. Pretty boring, a touch too strong, and not good in the least."
"Appearance - Cloudy amber/mahogany color with a monster head that fades in minutes leaving a delicate ring of lace behind.		Smell - Caramel malt and piney hops. A nice odor.		Taste - Very sweet caramel malt, a strong vanilla character that stays through to the aftertaste, strong initial hop character that rounds off to a bitterness with the vanilla for the aftertaste. I really like the vanilla, but this beer is far, far, far too sweet for my tastes. The abv is masked, but under an oppressive sweetness. I don't even usually mind sweet beers like a lot of people, but this is undrinkable to me - the taste makes me cringe.		Mouthfeel - Moderately thick and frothy. Quite drying.		Drinkability - After the first sip, I didn't want to finish this one. At 10% abv too many of these would put you out of commission. Would clash with anything I can think of eating. I don't understand how everyone seems to love this beer.		I am sorely dissappointed with this beer. I heard so many good things and am finding the reality not to my liking at all."
"Pours a deep and dark brown with significant creamy tan head which rapidly dissipates, leaving a good film and lacing. Smells of sweet malts and smoke, lots and lots of smoke. The flavor starts with initial thinnish smokiness, develops some brief, but tasty malt sweetness, and builds into a solid wall of chewy smoked-sausage flavors. A thick and chewy medium-heavy body compliments the flavors.		This was a frustrating beer for me. The all-too-brief sweet malt flavor and chewy texture made me want more, but the incredibly heavy liquid-pork flavors that dominate and finish the beer made it very difficult for me to get through the bottle. A taste I'm not sure I care to acquire."
"Thanks to Joe for the bottle. Your just helping me beat you in the race to 200, dude. Poured into a tulip glass on a snowy day while watching the winter Olympics. It has a dark red/brown color with just a wisp of a tan head. There are some small, flaky particles floating throughout.		The nose contains some toasted, oaky wood and alcohol. Vanilla is a bit strong and reminds me of vanilla extract. I would like more subtlety here. I'm not generally in to bourbon aged beers, so I appreciated that this didn't smell like it had a straight shot of whiskey in it, but the aromas of the beer itself were a bit underwhelming.		Flavor is rich caramel up front with some oak wood on the finish. Vanilla in the middle, and a bit too strong again. Slight dark fruits on the back. I'm glad this doesn't taste like whiskey, but there is a slight burn on the tongue and throat. The mouthfeel is unimpressive, and is the low light of this beer. It has a thin impact for its size. A bit thin, which carries a slightly syrupy liquor flavor in the finish. I would prefer heavier malt in the flavor mouthfeel.		This beer took me way to long to drink. It had some decent attributes, and some nice, subtle barrel character, but the base beer didn't impress me. It feels a bit lifeless in the mouthfeel, and the flavors just weren't my bag."
"Served from a bottle right to my mouth...		A: I did not pour this in a glass. I was at a social function and this was offered. The bottle is average. I felt because I was drinking an Amstel Light, I was drinking the higher end light beer and that my host had great beer taste. I was wrong. 		S: Skunky. I literally smelled the carbonation. Lacked a pleasurable scent		T: There was a lack of taste. Very weak bitterness, texture, and all round flavor. 		Mouthfeel: Carbonation overload. I did not care for this. Watery tongue feel. Many traits of a cheap beer here. 		Overall: I hate to rip on this beer. It is pricey and I know that the host of this party meant well. I can see why light beer drinkers like this beer. It is not the worst. I've certainly had better light beers. Note: I rarely drink light beers. When I have one, it is due to situations like this where it was all that was offered. 		To sum it up. Not the best but better than a handful."
"A- An aggressive pour yields a pitch black beer with a brown, one finger head.		S- Sweet chocolate and strong coffee with a bit of alcohol.		T-Strong, acidic, bitter, roasty coffee with a tiny hint of chocolate and a dry, alcoholic finish.		M-I really thought the oats would contribute a thicker mouthful. To my palate, this is on the very thin side of medium bodied with low carbonation, while having some smoothness.		D-I just really don't understand the hype on this one. I've had coffee stouts before and enjoyed them, but the alcohol presence (even though the ABV is only just over 8%) and strong coffee acidity don't lend themselves to a highly drinkable brew."
Light gold Color, large head. Aroma is grainy. Hoppy light tasting, with some malt flavor. Kind of thin mouthfeel, but it is a light beer so it sort of excueable. Not to bad, not to good. Typical pilsner taste. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
"Look: Black and totally opaque 1/4 inch head and no retention that settles into a thin collar with quite a bit of carbonation bubbles		Smell: Not too much going on here a touch of chocolate and oatmeal		Taste: The beer starts with this weird soapy like note at first maybe I thought it was my glass so I poured some more into a different glass and nope same soapy flavor. The beer then finishes with some oatmeal and roasted malts		Mouthfeel: Thin body and mildly carbonation		Overall: Not a very good beer. The flavors are just off on this beer. Epic Fail"
Pours hazy amber with a two finger white head. Well laced. Aroma is soap and a faint apple scent. Taste is soapy with a hint of boiled ham. Some modest bitterness lingers but no real malt character in evidence. My guess is this beer has been infected with a wild yeast strain. Or the brewer has a very uncommon type of yeast for this style of beer. I will try to visit the brewery some time or find it on tap locally. I hate to write a negative review of a local micro brew but it is what it is. If my next tasting yields a more enjoyable result I will gladly update my review. From a 22 ounce bomber.
"12oz bottle into Pilsner glass		I know a lot of people who turn their noses up at lighter lagers and swear by Pilsners. I personally enjoy the diversity of flavors that can be packed into some of the mid-range euro lagers. But I venture into Pilsners every now and then.		This beer poured a clear gold-yellow, with a substantial frothy head. This beer definitely has something to it. The first thing you'll notice when the aroma reaches your nostrils is the spiciness. Not my thing ususally, but I rather liked it. The taste was primarily spicy hops, with a little bit of bitterness. The malt wasn't as present as it is in a lot of other brews but I suppose it would have marred the distincitve character of this beer. It's not thick or thin, just right in my opinion. It would be easy to drink, if it weren't for its spiciness. Overall a surprisingly good Pilsner, even if you're not really a fan of the ilk."
"Thanks to Clvand0 and SheepNutz for helping me figure out what was going on with this beer - it apparently was originally contract brewed by Viking, but production has now moved to BBC (which gets the barest credit on the label.) A link to horsepissbeer.com leads to a bare-bones web page stating that a portion of the proceeds goes to disabled jockeys and horse adoptions.		When I first saw the bottle, I thought this was some pretty bold marketing, because, with a name like this, you better have a good beer or else the jokes will be all too easy. It turned out to be the latter. Pale straw with an antiseptic pure white head. Corn adjunct sweet aroma. Flavor was dominated by strong cereal flavor, as though the beer had been steeped in Wheaties and Cheerios. Ghastly. 		Prior reviews of the now-retired Viking version were relatively positive, so perhaps this beer is experiencing some initial shake-down problems. I hope so, because BBC otherwise is a pretty reliable brewery, I hate to see them associated with this poor effort."
"Brewed with Pale, Crystal, Wheat, and Roasted Barley malts; Bullion, Williamette, and Liberty hops.	OG=1.050, 4.9% ABV, 17 IBU.		Drank on tap at Pikes BC in Seattle, WA.		Clear, dark copper in color forming a dark beige head with excellent retention and lacing. Aroma is fruity with moderate sweetness, perfumy and floral, tart with notes of soap, very distant toast, and damp water socks. Ugh. Taste begins with oranges, followed by light chocolate, very nutty with fresh wood character, followed by a chemical pink eraser taste. Mouthfeel is initially harsh with a paradoxically smooth finish of moderate herbal bitterness. Medium-bodied. Very odd, and not very enjoyable."
I wonder how much they payed for the name and it pours a clear see through golden copper hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a twofinger head and heaps of lacing,the smell is weak grassy hops and sweet malts,it has a light bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of grassy noble hops,light toffee,caramel malts and finished with a noble grassy hoppy,dryness and overall if it wasnt for the name you would not even entice the idea its that much of a joke.
"Purchased at a Kingston, Ontario LCBO. 16oz, 473mL can, 4.9% abv. No freshness statement. Poured into a gold-rimmed Stella Artois glass.		Appearance is hazy copper, substantial off-white head. Leaving lace just sitting in the glass. Decent retention.		Aromas are powerful for a 4.9% abv cream ale. Hits me first with citrus hops - sweet grapefruit juice, tropical fruit huge here... almost too sweet and juicy. Softens out after a few minutes to some light sourness - grapefruit rind? Some bready, toffee, vanilla malt. Make sure to sniff this at pour, it is really out there. Distinctive but straightforward.		This leaves me with high expectations for the flavour. Mouthfeel is medium, moderate-high carbonation. Sour on the palate like sour mix, balanced with light sweetness. Maybe this is from the yeast. Not quite vinegary but it makes me wonder, sort of white winey. Green apple and stuff too. I'm not wholly convinced this was a cream ale in the first place but I'll run with it. Dry finish, like 90s dry beer.		I don't know what to do with this. Definitely weird. Check it out at your peril."
"Growler poured into a shaker pint. See-thru straw with a bubbly/fizzy head that quickly fades to a wispy skim of foam. A bit of lacing here and there.		The nose is fairly crisp and clean, but there's a fair amount of honeyish sweetness to this beer. Mild notes of peach and apple. Tastes decent enough, but lacking in the attenuation department. Definitely could stand to lose some of the residual sweetness, and to gain some carbonation. A little heavy and sweet on the palate for what should be a delicately constructed, refreshing style."
"Best before 09.2005...		Appearance: mahogany, great clarity, fluffy/creamy layer of tan head, lace		Aroma: coffee grinds, burnt toast, old books, malt, soy sauce, licorice		Flavor: roasty and toasty, dry malt backbone, slight acidity, finishes as dry as it starts with a roasty, rooty aftertaste		Mouthfeel: medium body, mild carbonation, a bit astringent on the teeth"
"I've had this one a couple times at tastings and had no idea that this one is now retired. 		A- Pours a clear, bright pale yellow with the slightest tinge of a reddish color with a super thin white head. Head has pretty much no retention and lacing. 		S- I only think I'm picking up is raspberries and maybe a tiny bit of bready malts.		T- Raspberry flavor and that's about it. This one is pretty much a wine cooler not a beer. 		M- Light in body and hardly any carbonation. 		D- There is no way I could drink an entire bottle of this. Still not digging the fruity beers. Probably a good reason why this one is now retired."
"A - Pours clear gold, threatening to overflow with foam. Head is thick, and rocky.		S - Light grassy/floral hops and sweet maltiness. Gives a bad impression.		T/M - Tart up front, with lots of apple over a minimal body. Feels light and watery. Big bitter finish, but not much hoppy flavour. On the sweet side. All the elements don't seem to meld well.		D - Overall, not a great beer. Misses being a drainpour, but lack of balance and lack of flavour really kills this one."
"frothed well but the head lasted only so long. lacing looks like it might be good. very dark, of course...with a hint of red blazing through the darkness		sweet smelling to start with a touch of smoke. enough char to keep it firmly in porter territory. nondescript hop aroma. not complex, really		it's smooth, as (ostensibly) advertised...and disappears from my tongue in a jiffy. some early sweetness, followed by kilned bitterness (which fades into hop bitterness)(but not enough), but everything vanishes without enough of a fight		aftertaste is strange. frankly, (like i said) it vanishes rather serrepticiously. i guess ""silk"" translates to ""sly""...but is that good? mild and session beers are meant to be drinkable, but i don't think that means innocuous"
"Thick, coarse tan head that because rocky as it reduced. The beer itself was dark brown and hazy with some caramel highlights. It smelled of toasted malt, bread, cherries, orange, and overpoweringly so of the woody tasting ground coriander. It had a fairly complex flavor profile consisting of toasted grains, rind-like hops, and once again overpowering coriander seed. The label states the beer had 8.2% ABV, but every single percent was very well hidden. After a brief moral debate I decided to finish this beer rather than pour it out, which I was very tempted to do. This beer is proof that everyone has different tastes and some are going to be worse than mine! ;-)"
"Eurotrash. This beer looked fine and inviting, pale copper color, thin white head, that vanished. Then the awful skunky smell, metallic, bitter, harsh taste. Just bitter taste watery, and acidic, then nothing on the finish.  I may have had a bad can, but this beer is lousy and sadly overrated. I can't agree with the ""beer drinkers light beer slogan"". It will be hard for me to try anything else from Amstel, despite the favorable reviews. I can't believe people ask for this."
"bottled 09/23/10		pours hazy golden copper with a 1+ finger head that faded and left some spotted lacing		smell - dry hopped lmao - faint bready caramel malt and light herbal hops		taste - wtf founders???? this is a watered down bready SNPA/Celebration 		mouthfeel light medium with decent carbonation - the only highlight of this beer		drinkability - not good - the only weak link in founder's armor - i have had this beer a few times before but didn't want to throw up a negative review but this beer just never got better - shame on you founders"
"Drinking this beer makes me ask a few questions. Why did I buy this? Why did they make a lager this strong that tastes like horrible cheap American booze beer? How can I help prevent others from making this error?		What also worries me is that I bought something else by this brewer. I will make sure I have had several others before I try it (to dull the pain). This was a bad purchase. 		I think it is the nasty malty flavor not balanced by decent hops that makes this taste so bad. I don't get the almost sexy label (or name, for that matter) either."
"12oz Bottle		Appearance - The beer pours a hazy copper colour with an average size frothy beige coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation showing and there is some really nice lacing on the sides of the glass. The head stuck around for a few minutes before it was gone.		Smell - malts, caramel, light hops, grass		Taste & Mouth - The beer has an average amount of carbonation on the tongue and feels fairly creamy. Most of the flavour consists of malts and hops mixed with caramel. The flavours are decent but they don't seem balanced. It finishes with a malty bitter aftertaste.			Drink - The beer definitely needs some balance, the flavours are decent but something just seems off."
"""He's a big, strong man with a child's mind, don't you take his booze away!"" - Dropkick Murphys		@ Atwoods, Sommerville MA. Found an extra $20 that I didn't know I had so I took my ladyfriend out for a beer.		Hazy copper color with a thin white head. Momentary thin skim throws up a few lacey splashes before dying out. Honestly, it wasn't a great pour.		Floral and citrus hop aroma with bubble gum. There's a very faint, mild fruit malt under there somewhere.		I didn't get the citrus bomb that many reviewers described but rather a clean, juniper and spruce bitter. Bubble gum pops up here and there with a piney caramel fade. Hoppy burps that tastes like I swallowed a pine tree. 		Odd malt character: I can feel it but it seems to be a tasteless vacuum, almost like a stock ale. Website claims it was made with 770 pounds of malt (the combined weight of three brewers/managers).		Overall this beer seemed to be everywhere and lacked focus. Not a fan."
Nothing special but it is capable of quenching your thirst on a hot day. The head and aroma were on par with each other - teetering on non-existance. Not possessing an abundance of flavour the taste is typical of European macrobrewed quaffs. The aftertaste is slightly better, and may be the best thing Amstel has going for it, and can be described as dry and slightly bitter. I can't honestly say I hated it but I can't recommend it, either.
"Best by: Oct 22, 2011		A: pours an amber ale with two fingers of peanut head which falls quickly to a sheet of the same. No lacing. Excellent clarity.		S: Sweet malts, herbal hops. More sweet malts. Some chemical smells here. Some butter, some corn.		T: Tastes like cheap, oxidized malts, tea, herbal hops and sugar. 		M: Medium body with hi carb. Dry finish		O: Not a good beer, and not much different than the IPA IMO."
"Pours a dirty brown in color without any head whatsoever. Absolutely flat . No head. No bubbles. Looks like standing puddle water. Nose is very slight with floral and citrus tones.		Flavor is a bit heavy on the heat from the alcohol. Lots of citrus and lime flavors. Floral upheaval. It's like I am drinking the leftover water in a vase full of roses. Just simply flat in mouthfeel. Very heavy and thick. Lots of heat from the alcohol. Almost makes me think of it as being a cask ale it is so flat but I do not think that was the intention."
"certainly is on the light side, though still a slight haze from the bottle conditioning. thin wispy white head. medium carbonation. 		interesting aroma. light and floral and very refreshing. 		taste seems to go in the opposite direction. sharp almost to the point of being harsh. not bitter, but maybe yeast or the wheat character is just a bit too much. behind that there is some pleasant light hoppiness to it, but its a struggle to find.		a bit disappointing. could see the potential, but it needs some work to smooth out."
"Poured from a small bright can into my Corsedonk snifter. Pours a nice looking copper color with nice size frothy white head. Decent head retention and lacing, but the lacing slides pretty quickly down the glass.		Aroma is hoppy! This one smells sweet and bitter...like a DIPA. Notes of orange, lemon, and hops. Mouthwatering...		Hmm, not such a good taste. One of those IPA's that is just bitter, no sweet taste to counterbalance, and very very dry finish. Just hops on the tongue. I can somehow taste a very faint sweetness trying to come through, but the hops just over-power it. Light and crisp mouthfeel with a ton of carbonation. Not a beer I'll be having again..."
"As someone who was introduced to scotch ales through Magic Hat's Jinx seasonal (which is still oft mourned by me, as there aren't many widely available low-cost scotch ales); this is at about the end of the spectrum in terms of intensity, learning curve, and ultimately - satisfaction.		A: Beautiful. Dark reddish brown, like a fine piece of furniture. Head is off-white with quite a bit of retention and lacing, which is refreshing and appealing for such a high alcohol brew.		S: Whoa. Once you take a whiff of this one, you realize you're in a whole different stratosphere than even other bourbon/scotch/whiskey barrel-aged beers. There is a strong smell of fine liquor, with brown sugar and vanilla bringing up the rear. Even if you don't like brown liquors, this beer BEGS you to take a sip.		T: Over the course of a 4-pack, this one has grown on me significantly. If you take a nice hearty sip and let the beer slide down your throat without just gulping it nervously, you start to sense the depth of character. It's still dominated by bourbon, but there are strong vanilla, molasses, and sweet oak flavors that come out to play. The aftertaste is more bourbon with a unique alcohol burn. Even for a 10%er, the alcohol warmth is far more noticeable than usual for a beer (and I'm guessing that's by design).		M: The mouthfeel is very nice due to the strong carbonation and warm boozy after-effects of each sip. You can sense the hard work that went into this beer when you consider that the extra carbonation goes a long way in reminding you that you're drinking beer - if they'd undercarbonated this one it'd just taste like some sort of bourbon equivalent of a wine cooler.		D: This is the only category that's not perfect, because it takes a long while to down one of these, and it's not for everyone. Even for me, someone who has given this beer aces all the way through this review, it takes quite a bit of effort, however satisfying each sip may be. There's just no way you can give this beer a high drinkability rating, regardless of how delicious it is.		Seek this one out. And get more than one bottle, because you're going to like it more and more with each one. And for the love of God - drink it cold!"
"A nice reddish copper color with a quick disappearing tan head. 		The aroma is mild blackberry with some hints of malt. 		The taste is similar with a bit of blackberry up front, slightly sweet but not offensively, slightly tannic, hints of malt, caramel and nuts, some mild herbal hops at the finish. 		Light bodied, a bit thin and watery. Altogether, more like blackberry tea than beer. Best when ice cold."
"This is very standard, very bland, uninteresting beer that is too grapefruity-bitter with too little else.		Lightly hazy amber, it has a medium-big off-white head steadily shrinking to a lasting thin head and leaving some good lace.		The aroma is bread, grapefruit, caramel, very juicy, and smells very much like a west coast ale and a bit like a less rich, more grapefruity Lagunitas Censored.		The taste and feel are not nearly as good. It's very bitter grapefruity with a little bitter lemon, a light caramelly-doughy malt character. It starts soft, slightly slick, but ends with rough, tongue-drying finish. It soon becomes mostly just grapefruity and bitter with only a light dough quality. It's somewhat reminiscent of Sierra nevada Pale Ale."
Absolutely opaque the carbonation is a little light for my taste but still balanced. The smell is pretty complex. Heavy Espresso smell with some chocolate as well. Acrid is defiantly the word Todd. Thick, very thick the 8.3 ABV is balanced well it taste like French roast coffee. Drinkability in my opinion does not apply to this brew it hit my stomach like a brick. I am very glad to have had the chance to try this legendary beer but I will probably not have another. Overall it is an extremely complex, intense beer. Someone put a lot of time and effort into this one.
"darker gold color, some presence of material suspended in the beer, but not thick enough to be called ""cloudy"". Not much for the nose, feint smell of grains and wheat, not really catching the traditional banana and clove. Taste was a little disappointing, (even though i wasn't expecting much from a beer made by costco) I can taste a little bit of hops, a little bit of clove, no banana or citrus present. This has a difficult rough finish that i don't like, somebody else described it as ""soapy"", it ruins any enjoyment I was getting from this beer. Mouthfeel is fine, a little watery, but I can deal with that. Overall, I wouldn't drink this again."
Dull appearance without head. Watery smell that roughly reminds me of beer, but I can't tell. Taste is lacking any flavor of beer. Bad without body, flavor, or taste. Mouthfeel was like sucking on water with a hint of beer. I could not have another one of these beers.
"A-Poured into a shaker pint. gorgeous deep candy burgandy. Little to no head. Vibrant looking. Definatly my favorite 	part of the beer.	S- fruity, spicy, piney, medicinal	T- about 2 to 3 times too much spice for me. Very alocholic tasting, maybe due to the low ibus. Also finishes like licking an evergreen. A pish posh of trying to fit all of the ""holiday flavors"" in one beer imo.	M- thin and syrupy	O- save your 7 bucks and try 3 or 4 other xmas beers for the same price..anchor, hibernation, 12 dogs(thirstydog)&lt;--my pick of the year so far for xmas beers."
"Par for the course for the style: golden body with an upward torrent of big, soda-like bubbles and an active, fizzy white head with not-too-bad retention. Smell is noticeably full of alcohol, but in a kinda nice tripel-like way; in fact, there is some delicate fruitiness and a nice fresh grain aroma here that is quite Belgian in character. Apples and pears flesh out the predominantly sweet nose; hops are basically undetectable. The taste is rather sweet, too, and boozy. There is a little nuance, but of course the problem with this style is that it was basically developed to try and answer the demand for beer that will get you drunk fast, slake your thirst, and cost you next to nothing - nuance doesn't really factor into it. So for what it is, it's not bad; off flavors are kept to a minimum, and while the alcohol is noticeable, it's not too hot. Hops are too timid, though; a bit more oomph from them and they could help balance out the sugars. The same goes for carbonation; it's too soft. More sparkle would help keep this refreshing. Overall, like most strong lagers like this, there isn't much point to this beer - Duvel, for example, is stronger, more delicious, more nuanced, more refreshing, and (this is key), not very much more expensive. So why waste your time?"
"A - Zero head. Not looking good so far. The body is a hazy orangish-yellow.		S - Sweet malt aroma with hints of mango.		T - Let me start out by stating it will be very difficult to get a real gauge of the taste here because this beer is completely flat. I will however do my best to distinguish that flavor ever though the texture is awful. It has a sweet malt flavor followed by a finish of hops.		M - Like I said, there is nothing here that helps this beer. It is flat and I'm not going to finish it.		 ~ I will get another and hope that it doesn't fail me again."
"Lucent gold with multiple, steady streams of bubbles that plow into the underside of a great looking, ivory colored cap that is more a loose collection of glassine bubbles than a tight mass of foam. Delicate clumps and small sheets of lace look good as well. This is one of the best examples of the style that I've seen in a while.		The nose, while no great shakes, doesn't come close to the appearance's quality. It's toasted grainy, mildly corny sweet and a little metallic, as if the beer was stored in stainless steel vats instead of a brown glass bottle.		Estrella Galicia is not an especially wonderful example of the style, although it is head and shoulders above most of what is brewed by BMC simply by virtue of having a considerable amount of (not overly offensive) flavor. Like the nose, toasted grain is uppermost, as is an impressive amount of bitterness that, unfortunately, isn't accompanied by much actual hop flavor.		Without much in the way of sweetness, I don't pick up the same corniness that I appreciated in the nose. The label lists maize as one of the ingredients, but it's fairly obvious that Hijos De Rivera didn't use an a-maize-ing amout of it. An increasingly harsh bitterness is the focal point and is making it increasing difficult to drink. As usual, colder is preferable to warmer.		I can't find much wrong with the mouthfeel. It's medium in a general sense and doesn't really change much over the course of the bottle. It starts out with a zippy amount of carbonation and finishes the same way.		According to the neck label, Estella Galicia is ""Brewed in Spain, one of Europe's leading beer-brewing countries"". That's news to me because I can't recall ever having a Spanish beer that could crack the top 100 from either Belgium or Germany. Although the name means 'star of Galicia', this offering is really nothing more than a dim glimmer in the dull macro lager sky."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.		A-Poured with a dark tan/khaki head which receded quickly, probably owing to the higher ABV, eventually down to pretty much nothing. Virtually opaque brown beer with slight garnet highlights and an eerie, swampy glow.		S-Vanilla oakiness, slightly woody right away. Dark and sweet, like a rich sugar candy, with a bit of tasty sugar and a hit of spirits.		T-The oakiness stands prominently forefront in this beer. Oaky vanilla character pairs with a large malty-sugary sweetness. Bitterness seems to derive from several aspects, a bit from the oak, a bit from the alcohol, and minimally from the hops. Malty-boozy notes rise later in the flavor finishing residaully oaky and alcohol.		M-Full-bodied beer feels solid, slow-moving, and sticky. Carbonation was predictably low-level.		D-This beer is not very drinkable by the standards of high ABV brews. The alcohol was very prominent, and the barrel aging seemed to give it a bit too much of a harsh spirit-like quality."
"This is a lager for people that like very very subtle flavor and a very bland lightly bodied beer. Personally, I prefer tap water. It has your basic semi-sweet malty flavor with steady carbonation and a heap of mild hops. There is not much of a flavor profile at all, but that's the point so I guess its decent for people who dont want to be seen holding a bottle of Bud. In my own arrogant opinion....""More of the same bland skunky tasteless mass produced schwag!"" Quote me on that!"
"bottles purchased at Ramon Liquor in Rancho Cucamonga, CA.		A- a dark amber, fairly clear, off white head.		S- smells like old hops and burnt caramel malt.		T- Hoppy, in a syrupy way, moderate bitterness, burnt, astringent caramelized sugars.		M- Medium		D- Does not have a good flavor to me."
"12oz. bottle best by 7/06		Pours a clear peach color with a small white head that thins. Decent lacing on the glass.		Aroma is very malty and bready with a nice fruitiness.		Starts off nice with a sweet malt taste and rich fruitiness, but suddenly becomes very metallic and bland. The metallic taste lingers.		Full body, decent carbonation.		Geez, this beer seemed like a winner until the flavor takes a dive."
Pours with a cristal clear goden body topped by a thick white head with lots of lace. Sweet and fruity aroma with some odd notes. Actually smells kind of like tomato sauce(???). Sweet yet slightly bitter hoppy flavor wtih a good malty balance and a bitter finish. Light bodied, smooth and a touch dry.
"I really try not to judge a beer by its cover, but come on- really? I'm expecting a gimmick. I have always seen this beer in the store a passed it by. My boss knows I'm a huge beer geek, and gave me a bottle for feedback, so here goes... 	Appearance- poured from a bottle into an English pint glass. Pours a pale amber, with a white head, little to no lacing.	Aroma- Not bad, really. smells like English pale malt, a bit bready. some fruit.	Flavor- mark for mark, it's okay. Breadiness, a bit of fruit, modest hop character. Typical English Pale.	Mouthfeel- malty. Unfortunately, this seem to fall a bit too sweet- it sort of hangs onto the palate too long.	Drinkability- Obviously, this isn't my favorite style, but this beer is okay. I might drink it again, but it would have to be another free bottle."
"Looks like a strong glass of tea with a red tinge. Head makes a quick departure, no lace.		Nose is sweet malt with just a whiff of pepper.		Mild, slightly sweet malt was all I got out of drinking this one. A hint of hops if you let it warm up long enough. No dimension to this beer."
"Beautiful amber gold color. Clear, with a bit of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. The beer has a nice head. The nose is a strong IPA nose of citrus, pine, and straw.		I wanted to like this beer very much, but I didn't. I found it very dry and hoppy, but I definitely detected the alcohol. Perhaps it's just me, but I think it detracts from the flavor of the beer. My palate calculates thus: hops + alcohol = mediciney. Then again, I've never been a huge fan of barleywines, so other people may really flip over this combo."
Pours with a one-fingered off-white head that fades quickly and leaves traces of lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Cloudy amber color. Nose is slightly hoppy. Starts hoppy, finishes with strong hoppiness, what else with an amber. Not my style. $1.25 for a 12oz bottle from Liquor Barn Lexington, KY.
"No date on the bottle, so who knows how fresh it is (annoying).		Pours a cloudy amber color. About 1"" of head, it hung around for a minute or two. No lacing, no retention.		Smells a little piney, some grassy hop aroma too. Not easy to pick up, aroma is pretty faint. It actually smells better right from the bottle rather than after it's poured into the glass.		Tastes kindof bland. There's a good bit of bitterness, and some caramely malt, but not much else. Some pine, but not much. A little bready. Not what I was expecting from a DIPA. 		Not much going on. Other than the bitterness, there's nothing more to the mouthfeel. Not much carbonation. 		Probably won't try it again, unless they put a ""born on"" date on the bottle somewhere. Definitely not worth the $12 I paid for it."
"1 pint .9 oz bottle ...pours a dark almost black but when put up to the light is almost copper colored very thin....nice lacing, very sticky.		smelled alcohol and some burnt wood flavor.		I really didn't like the first drink as it hit hard with the sour flavor up front and then gets woody/burnt in the middle then back to the sour in the aftertaste that lingers for minutes.		But after a couple drinks this brew grows on me a bit as the sour notes dont seem quite as strong and the body of the beer comes forward...very malty as it warms up. I think this beer was at its best around 55-60 degrees....Will buy this again"
"Poured into a pint glass the first thing that hit me was a ""tootsie roll lolly pop""-like aroma. Descent one inch head quickly receded leaving no lacing. Hazy dark orange appearance with quite a bit of carbonation. I certainly taste the cherry and chocolate... tastes like a cherry tootsie roll pop, not exactly what I look for in a beer. I found it tough to get through the whole thing, for my tastes the cherry was cloying."
"12oz brown bottle. No date.	It pours a gold color with a snow-white head and a fair amount of lace.	A grainy cornhusk and grassy aroma is upfront and lasting. A faint smell of Euro-hop sneaks in the background.	The malt has a grassy and corn-like taste.	A light citrus and faint metallic bitterness are this brew's best quality. A very faint herbal taste is also a redeeming feature. The alcohol is barely noticeable.	Starts and finishes dry."
Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a dark cherry color with a two-finger, off-white head that quickly dies down. Smell reminds me of Rock n' Rye Faygo pop combined with a Tootsie pop... not at all like a beer. The taste is very similar to the nose with the chocolate, tootsie pop taste coming through the most. The mouthfeel is very light with a creamy, bubbly carbonation. The drinkablility is damaged due to the fact that it tastes more like a soft drink than a beer... unless you like that sort of thing. A good drink for girls who don't like beer.
"40oz can received as a holiday gift from someone who knows nothing about beer but knows I love it. In the interest of expanding my horizons, I chilled it and poured it into a highball glass. Its clear, pale yellow body sits underneath a 2-finger head of snow white foam.		The nose might be new to most, presenting apples and pears above a very slight mossiness, but it's not much different from phmre. It's the sweetness, really, in its cloyingness, that offends.		The flavor profile, or lack thereof, is singlemindedly sweetness, in the form of corn syrup. It isn't quite sickening when it's cold and at 12oz, but I was hard-pressed to finish the can especially as it started to warm up. Just like melted ice cream.		To its credit, it hides the alcohol extremely well. It has an impressive head considering the majority of its audience will not see it. The body is slightly sticky but is probably at the optimal point for the style. Serves its purpose but not much else."
"Seriously they served it as the grey whale today even though it is retired. It makes me question the brewery all together. 		This is an old school brewery that is not getting the taste buds going. They need to step up to compete I say. 		They have it hanging on the bat as grey whale. Odd. 		There is little to no flavor. I wanted flavor from them. All well 		Color is orange with a hint of red no head 		This is more soda like then beer and little taste where you would expect it. There is a lot of carbonization on the tongue and the back of the throat"
"12oz into Newport Storm pint glass. 2010 bottling. Thought the first bottle was off, so I drank another the following night.		A- Dark roasty brown, a bit of a light brown head that fizzes out. 		S- Bourbony notes, caramel/molasses. Nothing great, nothing awful.		T- Taste is bourbony, but not very good. Earthy, musty, dull, and oxidised. There is a heavy burbon note but it's dull and unexciting. Where's the vanilla and oak? All I'm getting is burnt sugar and dull earthy notes. Unappologetic booze permiates, but I've had far boozier beers that incorporate it better. 		M- Decent enough body and carbonation but there are some off-notes in the flavor and finish that I'm not really enjoying.		D- Low. Thought I was going to enjoy this one as the chatter in the forums is quite abuzz over this beer. Not the case- I'm going to gift out the two remaining bottles as I don't want to drink this. Not a drainpour, but not enjoyable. I love bourbon, straight up, on the rocks, and in my beers, but this one was a misfire IMO.		What kind of barrels are these in? Remind me never to buy that bourbon."
"Shared 2 bottles with a friend on two separate occasions.		Poured a nice golden amber into a snifter. Very attractive beer with nice head that did not hang around too long.		Smell, well this is where it went downhill for me. It smelled like a mix between mildew, old garbage and a skunk.		The taste resembles the smells listed above. It tasted like a skunk smells. 		Overall I thought this beer was one of the worst beer experiences of my life. I know that it is best fresh and that the hops fade with time. However, with this one the hop pressense was still there, it just tasted awful. Not sure really why it tasted so bad."
Good Lord, this stuff is something else. Poured out with little head, and had a strong scent of alcohol and sugar. The brew was far too sweet for me and left me hung over less than an hour and a half later. I would go with any other malt liquor unless you are looking for a reason to get a headache.
"Consumed at the Bistro's 10th Annual Double IPA Festival. Apricot pour with a frothy white head. Slight hop aroma but there is an almost medicine-like smell which is not good. Taste is very harsh. If rubbing alcohol had a taste, this might be it. Slight burning sensation on the sip as well. Drinkability is down right tough. Something is just not right with this batch.		Overall I really like the Pacific Coast beers, but this particular one was not on par with the others. Wasn't digging it."
"From a 12 oz. bottle with a blurb on the neck label and a best before date in the upper right hand corner of the front label.		Poured a clear dull orangey golden with a foamy white head that settled into a thin sudsy lacing.		Aromas of cooked sweet corn mixed with a lemon honey and lightly floral and spicy.		Good carbonation and a crisp, dryish, smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel.		If this didn't have a corny metallic edge towards the end, it would be a decent macro lager, starts with a sour grassy graininess, sweet corn and lemon, a light spiciness, then comes the metallic flavors that also adds a staleness in the aftertaste, and a dry malty finish.		I wonder if this would be better closer to actually source than here in the middle of America, nothing special, but could be decent hot weather lager."
While sometimes less is more, here an enthusiastic load of spices was simply way too much - actually overwhelming. Nutmeg, allspice, clove - raid the spice cabinet. A pumpkin pie with this much spice would be overdone, and this beer bordered on undrinkable. Sweet, a bit syrupy malt with some ETOH heat. Struggled on for a while and gave up.
"Poured the hand-dated (1797 of 2398, 01/10/10) bomber into an oversized red wine glass to capture the aroma.	A: Very dark brown with red hues, it poured with a small chocolate spritzy head that immediately died to a very thin collar.	S: Earthy smoked and roasted malts, sweet cream with some raisins, but overall somewhat porky (like a rauchbier).	T: BBQ pork lingering over a mild sweet cream malts with some caramel and a slight oak barrel and whiskey alcohol.	M: Very thin--too thin--and not very carbonated.	D: It's not very good. I don't really want to finish my half of this bomber, but it isn't a drainpour."
"I poured this oddly named brew into my .5L Spaten stange. A bit of foam formed atop this slightly hazy straw colored lager; but after a minute, nary a head was to be found.		It has an odd combination of malt, alcohol, and corn that smells ok despite the unappealing description.		Taste like a big Heineken but with a distinct bitterness. Fairly malty.		Somewhat syrupy.		This beer is not as clean as the last one I had from this brewery; though both are extremely similar. It packs a punch, and despite the subtle flavor, the alcohol is pretty well hidden. It gets tough to finish this one when it warms up"
"The porter pours a deep dark mahogany brown bordering on black but there's almost no carbonation. Even with a vigorous finish to the pour there was at best a thin collar of bubbles that instantly disappeared.		The nose was pleasant with a good dark caramel aroma mixed with a toasted note. Only a little sweetness in the smell.		Flavor was pretty run-of-the-mill for a porter with a few caramel notes, a strong focus on roasted, coffee-like flavors and note much else. No hopping that you'd notice and very little sweetness either.		Mouthfeel was disappointing. The porter was thin - as if they'd taken a standard porter and watered it down a bit. Light bodied, no residual sugars to leave a coating on the palate and very little carbonation to add any sparkle. The finish is a roasted grain bitterness (light, like everything else) but it doesn't leave you wanting more.		Not much to recommend in this beer except that it would make a good session beer. With a light body it's not very filling, low carbonation and a light, inoffensive taste it'll take a lot to really notice this beer."
"Purchased in Quebec City in July, 2010. No date on the bottle.		Poured into a beer mug moderately and got an aggressive mocha head (1/3 of the mug) atop a black stout. Head caps nicely, although it didn't lace. About everything I would want in a stout. The nose has an appealing aroma of licorice and roasted grains. The taste though is all off kilter, initially it comes fairly smoothly and stout like but then an acrid burnt taste dominating everything that lingers forever... Bleah. I chocked it down, all the while contemplating ""Drainpour?"""
Picked up a couple bottles of this one for my wife on Christmas eve, and split one with her later that night. Poured a deep, dark red amber with a medium off-white head. Aroma here is all cherries and chocolate, very sweet and syrupy. On the palate, somewhat cloying, medium bodied, again, all cherries and chocolate, remeniscent of a sickly sweet chocolate covered cherry candy. Not bad, but a few ounces goes a long way here.
"Amber shade of yellow with a decent head that fades quickly. Maltier than the average macro, with a dry finish that might be the faint echo of hops. It made me think of a weak Oktoberfest.		It's not a great beer, or even a particularly good one, but it has more character than the average tapas joint beer-from-a-Spanish-speaking-country beer."
It's better to state this from the beginning: I prefer my cured meats on the side and not in the brew. The rauchbier poured with two fingers of beige foam. It has a nice brown color and smells of cured meats and burned wood. The taste is smokey, of cured meats and some metal with a bitter bite of hops in the end. It has a creamy mouthfeel although it feels a bit weird to drink. I think it is an interesting beer but drinking it will never be a habit of mine.
Lithuanian Ghetto Liquor very sweet with an alcohol kick. Sweet candy corn aroma. Nice pour strong carbonation real cool to watch. Sticky sugary mouthfeel. Candy flavor common among the beers I've had from this country, but there is nothing to back the sweet taste. Very one dimensional and definitely a slammer.
"Pours a very dark brown, sort of mahogany when held to the light, with only a finger or so of head. I thought it was flat when I was pouring it until finally it generated some minimal, tan colored head. Keeps only a half full, mostly bubbly lace, with just about no stick. 		Smell has some caramel and chocolate sweetness, some earthy and citrusy hops, and a bit of roasted malt. Light smokiness as well. I really don't detect any alcohol which is surprising given the 12%. Some nice things going on here.		Taste is...what the hell?...not what I was expecting given the nose. It's bitter as hell, and charred, and is quite harsh and astringent. I'm searching high and low for some redeeming value but I'm just not finding it. It starts off bitter, then comes a deeply roasted to the point of being burned flavor, then comes more bitterness that shatters the palate. It does leave some citrus and earthy hop flavor in the finish; thanks for that, as I'm licking my lips from the terrible bitterness. I love hoppy, bitter beers, but this is WAY over the top. I can't even let it linger on the palate to look for any softer malt or hop flavors. As it warms the burned flavor calms only slightly, allowing some very dark chocolate flavor to open up a bit. Still, this is overly roasted, overly bitter, and just not very good. 		Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and very dry in the finish. Bitterness just wrecks the palate and dries the hell out of it. Not very pleasant at all.		As I was drinking and reviewing this I went and looked at other reviews to see if I'm just way off base or if maybe this bottle is somehow bad. I found Ding's review, whom I rarely agree with, and I am surprised to say that I am in nearly full agreement with him, thus confirming that this bottle is just fine, it's just not a very good beer. Bottom line: this is way out of balance and just plain harsh at times, and is, quite frankly, not very good."
"The Rauchbier style is an old German beer style, its origins go back to the 1500's and to the district of Franconia and the town of Bamberg. It's typically of dark colour and has similarities of the Oktoberfestbier. Green malts are literally dried over an open fire of beech wood, imparting a unique smokiness (""rauch"" is German for smoke), the usage of which produces beers of an acquired taste. Imagine a smokiness so robust, so assertive, that it tastes of spiced, smoked meat. 		Well, this has to be my first smoke beer from Germany or anywhere by that matter. When I pop the top on this beast I actually smell smoked beer, dying to try it now because my mouth is watering. Let me taste it now. 	Ok thats different so where's the ham and chesse?	This would defintely fit in with ham and chesse group. 		The pour, Huge head but didn't last long, bummer.		This says a pint and 9 oz. good becuse the last ber was 11.2 oz. 		Dark but you can see through it with light. 		I need to look up what Marzen means.		Brewed back in the 1500's, hmm don't really get into them much.	Well it's thick and chewy so I like that but something is throwing it off for me. 	The days would have to be colder for me to enjoy this one more. 	So if you like meat really bad you will like this one."
"Aromas are of faint bourbon and some cork, nort oak, but cork. Sweetenes, but not in a good way, I am leary...		The tatse is miserable. Watered down bourbon and soggy oak, tastes like a homebrew which is very premature. Light smokiness and roasted grain. Mouthfeel is thin with medium carbonation.		One and done definitely. I remember drinking their bourbon brown ale last year and feeling the same way. This brewery is a long way from pro status in my opinion. Way too thin and watery. Flavor is weak and needs more behind it. Worst bouron barrel or any wood aged beer I have consumed to date."
"This is the first professed wheat wine I've seen in the Pacific Northwest, though at 6.7% ABV, it hardly qualifies for the style. Wet Dog (presumably no relation to the Astoria brewpub of the same name) is opaque ochre and delivers no head, no lace, and no appreciable smell. Its tart flavor is neither sharp nor peppery and might best be described as dry and bland like wet chaff.			Harmon's menu placard, describing Wet Dog as an IPA that, ""will make a hop head's tail wag,"" is a complete fallacy. Hop flavor is barely discernable, let alone prominent, and causes no undue tail wagging by hop heads or others. The beer is served fashionably warm and begs for a wedge of fresh lemon. It's not awful, but otherwise just doesn't come together in any meaningful way."
"Consumed from a 40 ounce bottle taped to hands.		A: Bright orange, like most common malt liquors, and very high carbonation.		S: Very little to the smell other than a bit of corn and alcohol.		T: This is where it really goes bad. Tastes like corn, alcohol, and perhaps gasoline. Whatever the final potent flavor is, it certainly is not good.		M: A ton of carbonation; it doesn't go down very well at all.		D: A 40oz of this is probably more than anyone should drink, but at $2 a forty, and 8.2%, a fun but quite foul beer to play drinking games with.		Having consumed Natural Light before, as well as Miller and Bud, and even OE and Colt 45, this is by far the worst beer I have ever tried. Probably also the quickest way to get drunk on beer."
"Thanks to ritzkiss for bringing this little bottle by. I love trying ""interesting"" brews and this one certainly qualifies. 		The very first BA review of this beer specifically mentions an interest in aging this specimen for four years. As far as I can tell, this was a one-off, so here it is at ~four years. I would have loved to have tried it fresh in order to compare. Since there's no brewing date or best before on the bottle, here's a rundown of what I found inside:		Critical Mass pours a murky, dull straw colour with some black sludge sediment from the bottom of the bottle. The head is to be expected of such a high ABV; only a ring around the glass of large, white bubbles. This honestly does not look very appealing. 		At 13% or 15% ABV (?), you would think four years of aging wouldn't be out of the question. Well, it is. Scents of rubber shoe, mint and baking soda prevail with chemicals, alcohol, orange rind and some light hops following. If I was wearing a blindfold, I would have thought this is some kind of cleaning solution. 		What comes to mind immediately was the time I tried chewing a Tylenol instead of swallowing it; a bad idea which is even worse in beer form. Bitter medicine dominates, along with burning rubber and electronics, artificial sweetener and more mint. I can't even put into words how bad this tastes. Eric, are you trying to poison me? 		The feel...does it matter? 		Worst. Beer. Ever. Period. Probably the most disgusting liquid my mouth has ever encountered. Why can't I rate drinkability as zero? Impressively terrible; quite an achievement. I think I wet my tongue three times with this stuff before pouring it down the drain. The label depicts this brew perfectly: an atomic bomb of nastiness."
"12oz bottle poured into a tulip type glass...		A - Deep copper to dark reddish-apricot color... Quickly receding head, but beautiful while it lasts, almost guinness-like before it fades...		S - Very Malty, but not necessarily in a good way... reminiscent of a 'malt beverage' like mickeys... very light chocolate and fig notes... definitely get a little toffee as well... Alcohol comes thru towards the end with a slight stinging sensation...		T - No real overpowering tastes... Nice chocolate initially... into maltiness, but not as much as one would think from the smell... and of course into what I call the 'cliche bock' tinge... if you have ever had a [double] bock before you know what I am talking about... Not the greatest aftertaste... more of the 'malt beverage' quality seems to come out in the aftertaste...		M - medium-light carbonation which I personally like for this style of beer, but to each his own... medium bodied...		D - Well it starts off nice... but the aftertaste killed it for me... I will say that it became much easier to drink as it warmed up tho, surprisingly... 		Needless to say, not my cup of tea... But for bock lovers, I would definitely give it a whirl and see if it strikes your fancy..."
"Bottle picked up at Rick's in Alexandria. Thanks, Jon, for warning me. Unfortunately, Amyliz4 insisted that we buy and drink this. Even worse, she likes it. Served in a St. Bernardus goblet.		Pours a moderate brown color with a bit of a crimson hue. Single-finger head falls quite quickly without any lacing. A thin collar around the edges with a bit of a spiderweb cap on top. Nose is straight-up cinnamon. Cinnamon domination here. That'll open up your nostrils. Not offensive, just quite overpowering.		Then comes the taste. Are you kidding me? Half a jar of cinnamon into some lightly-sweetened water. Carbonate it up a bit and you've got Frosted Frog! Wow, this is not a good-tasting beer. I suppose aside from the cinnamon there's also a bit of light spruce character. Either way, this is just a cinnamon bomb and basically unpalatable. Son of a lady frog does this taste stay with me...I really can't get it out of my mouth. I don't even know if a shot of gin would work at this point. Mouthfeel? Spice. Cinnamon. Yuck. I'd drainpour the rest of this bottle if Amy didn't insist on drinking it all."
"I'll probably go against the grain on this beer and not give it the a+ rating that a lot have.		A: Did have a great look. Dark, Dark, Dark, with a small tan head. 		S: Smelled good of chocolate and coffee.		T: Wasn't that impressed with the taste. The balance was nice and probably deserves a high score for the ABV balance, but just not for me. I'm not sure stouts are my thing.		M: About average for a quality stout.		D: For those who like this kind of brew, this will certainly be up your alley."
"Appearance: Slightly cloudy dark yellow/orange. Off white foamy head 1 1/2 fingers. Looks good to go. 		Smell: Not a whole lot here. The rye is up front. There are some hops way in the back. The malts are generically sweet and overpowered by a somewhat grainy bitterness. 		Taste: Not far off from the smell. I don't really get much hemp at all. The rye is there and not terribly interesting. The hops just don't do much for me either, just barely noticeable.		Mouthfeel: Fairly light with average carbonation. If the beer delivered a little more in flavor this may have complimented it well. 		Drinkability: Not a drain pour, but I would turn down free ones in the future. From the name of the beer I thought I would love it. Hops, hemp, rye, all things I love. I just didn't deliver."
"A huge sign boasting of this being Canada's strongest beer caught my attention at the Toronto Beer Festival. Inside the tent it was being served from colorful 'radioactive' barrels.		It pours a very dark brown, nearly black with no head to speak of, just a few bubbles around the edges. The aroma is a heady mix of dried fruits, figs, demerara rum and shear sweetness. The taste is extremely sweet with banana notes and an estery alcohol solvency. Alcohol heat and port notes make up the finish. Hops are alarmingly absent. The mouthfeel is very light for a beer of this gravity.		Its OK, but unneccesarily strong (15% at the fest). Alcohol dominates the flavor. It seems to be gimmick of sorts, relying more on novelty and flashiness than substance."
"Corn kernel yellow with creamed corn trim. The three finger cap is off-white, not quite dark enough to be called dingy white, and looks pretty decent. The bubbles are popping rapidly, but they're so fine and so tightly packed that little deflation has occured in the first several minutes. Respectable.		The nose is typical Euro strong lager, although it's weaker than most. That means that any offensiveness that might have been present is kept to a minimum and that no alcohol is noted. Both are good traits in a lack of negatives kind of way. I need something of a positive nature if I'm going to grant an average score.		I feel the same way about the flavor, more or less. One thing Baro has going for it over the nose is that I can actually taste something. Unfortunately that 'something' is nothing to shout about. Sweet corny grain and a modicum of noble hops is about it. The low ABV (relative to the style average) helps to keep alcohol flavor and burn to a bare minimum.		The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium and possesses a finishing slickness that could stand a few more bubbles to liven things up. I expected more carbonation than I'm getting because crown cracking led to a louder than usual 'pffft'.		This is my first beer from Rinkuskiu Alaus Darykla. Needless to say, I'm less than impressed. Since I have several of their higher ABV offerings in my cellar, I was hoping for something from Baro Traditicinis that would make me remember it past the time when I wash out my glass. Magic 8-Ball says... not bloody likely."
"Dark amber color. I smelled like caramel and cocoa butter.		The flavor was a mash up of Nutella, vanilla, cheap milk chocolate and caramel, more cocoa butter, macadamia nuts etc.		Full bodied, and the finish just kept bringing on the flaver mentioned above to make a beer that I had to dump out.		the over all impression was one of numerous artificial flavors.		I bought two bottles, and I refuse to touch the other one."
"Extra Stout is printed on the label of this one but after holding the bottle up to the light it is apparent they just mean heavy. Pretty corny looking label but it is lacking the sort of silly slogan some of their other beers have.		Dirty golden with a slight tinge of red. Lots of bubbling and a decent but short lived head that left some nice lacing behind.		The smell is sweet and grainy with a medicinal spiciness.		It tastes the same as it smells only in a more aggressive way. Sickeningly sweet with an off-putting herbal/medicinal spice.		The syrupy/oily mouthfeel hides most of the carbonation, I guess if you're looking for a quick buzz it wouldn't be too tough to drink this one pretty quickly.... but watch out, once it warms the alcohol shines through with a vengeance.		It tastes like cheap candy. And not good cheap candy that will lull you into a state of nostalgia. This is ""I'm not going to that house next year on Halloween"" cheap candy. After a glass what was left in the bottle went down the drain."
"With the Stone Roses "" All Across The Sands "" on the Hi-Fi and being on a IPA bender lately . I took some time to review this brew . Poured into a pint glass this tawny , brassy looking brew is very nice to look at . Eggshell thin fingered head which did not last long . As for smell , there is none . Nothing comes to my mind . No grapefruit , pine , nothing citrusy / fruity at all . Over the weekend I had a few Ruinations . That stuff smells so good , never mind the taste . To me that is my fav . If Yankee Candle had a Ruination candle I would buy it and the car freshener too . As it goes down there is nothing that would want to make me buy it again . It is not bad , not at all . The flavor though is not there . Mouthfeel is thick , with again no flavor . With my cheeks getting red from the 10 ABV% there is a kick that is hidden so be careful .	I think this is the last time I will be anywhere near this brew again . 		Bland , Boring , and Bleah"
"The appearance is fine; the rich black/brown you can not see through. The aroma, sweet maypo oatmeal on a snowy winter morning. Pours an ok head that dissapears quickly. Then came the taste! Rancid and nasty. This is the first time I ever took one sip and poured the rest down the drain!"
"look I could see a garnet purple in the pouring but in the glass,black Thin tan head does not last long. Leaves sip rings.		Aroma, dark malt,a ""sort of"" bitter chocolate,some dark sweet bread and some sort of fruity tang like peaches and raisins soaked in rum.		Flavor Starts okay with approximate coffee/chocolate stouty tastes,and there's some odd thing,like a fruitcake made with a lot of overcooked canned beaches,some sour cherries and some booze. I've tasted that combo in Brandywines and Belgians,but it's the opposite of what's usual in Oat Stout.		In the aftertaste,the bitter is rather wooden with a little metallic and finishes with some sour that's not welcome. I tend to be a sucker for a good oatmeal stout...this one I don't care for.	It's ragged,it's not true to style. The good parts get buried by an odd mix of cloying old fruit,a sourness,and a bit of booziness that with the fruity effects and sour reminds me way too much of a jug wine.		Mouth, A tad thin. Carbonation is fine. The aftertaste is a wreck. I got a sip that was a bit like a cherry flavor cough syrup. Then it went sour from there. WTF ?		Drinkable? Not real good. The many flaws are not,individually overwhelming but they sure add up. Someone who loves a Dubbel might like this more. 		This is not drainpour but of the many Oatmeal Stouts I have had...this is in last place.		Looking at reviews....It seems this stuff is pretty variable and the impressions mostly don't describe THIS one...though some DO."
"Pours a very clear golden hue. Thick white head, slowly dissapated to a crown which delicately laced the side of the glass. Nice.		Strong odor of hops and grass...faint ""skunk"".		Grainy sweetness quickly gives way to a tannic bitterness. High carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel. A bitter finish leaves the palate dry.		Standard, no-frills pilsner. I wish they would lose the green glass. It might improve the nose. Refreshing enough, nonetheless. Not something to buy a ""sixer"" of...but a fair diversion at a restaurant."
Acquired via trade. The last Smoked beer I had was the Alaskan Smoked Porter. Damn that was a good beer. This? Not so much. The beer is a nice dark brown color with a medium beige head and thin lacing. The aroma is equal parts ashtray smoke and Purina Beggin Strips. Medium-bodied with a very smoky character, as a matter of fact it dominates everything else in the beer. The finish is more of the same. I think my wifes question of why I smelled like a cigarette (I dont smoke) after drinking it about sums it up. Its just too much.
"The colour is pale gold; the high airy head is off white. No lacing. 		The smell is light with malty flavours of dough and some slightly chemical bitterness. Hints of minerals and wheat flour. 		A flavour of dough evolves into a watery taste with some minerals and hints of sweetness. Some slight flavours of cardboard and wheat wafers. The aftertaste is watery with a hint of margarine. 		The carbonation is medium, as is the bubble size. The liquid is somewhat watery. 		Well... What can I say about this one? It is cheap and weak."
"Probably the worst product of this nice Slovenian brewery.		Color bright yellow, with an amber streak, high level of carbonation, small short-living head, practically no lace.		Smell hoppy, herbal, floral, weak but quite pleasant.		Start watery, body very thin, taste uninteresting with faint notes of this and that, finish on the hoppy side, short uninspiring aftertaste.		A faulty interpretation of famous German style. Canned version is lower on alcohol: 3.5% ABV only."
Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, sugary peaches. In the taste, sugary peaches and somewhat a small tartness. A small sour bite and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry peach flavor in the aftertaste. A bit too sugary and sweet, nice peach flavor, but again, too sweet for me.
"A coworkers father travels frequently to Egypt for business. He's brought back a few samples. I really wasn't sure if I would ever drink this one, but, since it wasn't even listed, I thought I would review it just for the sake of adding it to the database.		Poured quickly into a pint glass, a two finger white head formed atop a pale gold body. The head starts to shrink rapidly.		I doesn't smell as bad as I might have expected, but it isn't good. Cooked vegetables and fusel alcohol.		Adjunct sweetness and paint thinner to taste. Served very cold keeps it from being too offensive, but there is an uncomfortable heat to the finish.		The mouthfeel is slightly oily, with high carbonation. Leaves a slight film across the tongue.		If ice cold, I could see myself finishing a can of this, but the only reason I could imagine for drinking it would be to get drunk very fast."
"Consumed at brewery on Saturday, November 5th 2011.		The beer is very dark brown, almost black, but still clear. Virtually no head.		Aromas of iodine, rust and... there! Some dark roasted grain.		Flavor is smoky with a hint of bitter chocolate. Oh, and sour. Not good sour, but infection sour. Not out of control and unservable to the public sour, but management decided to sell this rather than dump it sour.		Mouthfeel is similar to carbonated water.		Drinkability - none. Avoid this one. Even without the infection, this would be unremarkable."
Appearance is cloudy, with an array of hues that make the beer look delicious and inviting. A fluffy nougat head on top. A dark brown to mahogany glow to the bottom of the glass. The smell is unbelievable. Sweet fruits to a chocolatey, malty backbone. Taste's earthy. Not quite what I was expecting. A lot of hoppy bitterness. Hot alcohol. Malt and grains somewhere in the mix. Definitely a sipper. As it warms up it tastes more and more like bourbon or a brown liquor. Have a good night...
"Current ABV is listed at 4.8		Frangelic Stout is on a nitro-tap, and the appearance of this beer is excellent...a thick white head, perfect stout black colouration, very appealing to look at. The smell of this one lets you know that the Frangelica is present, because it's a hazelnut bomb with some slight roasty notes on the side.		The flavour is pretty much what one would expect given the components: the backbone of the beer is a smooth, creamy stout with some subdued roast tones, while the Frangelica coffee controls most of the flavour with a strong hazelnut tone. I find the pairing enjoyable but not amazing, if you really like hazelnut coffee, this is a must try though.		The mouthfeel on this, above average, trending toward good. It's creamy and full, enjoyable. Drinkability is the only place where I really have to knock this beer, and it's the same reason why I would knock the rating on hazelnut coffee if I was rating coffee at CoffeeAdvocate.com, it's abrasive on the stomach and tastebuds if you have more than one.		Frangelic Stout is a nice stout offering by Founders. Personally, I would never have more than one in an evening, but it's a good change of pace, and fits the winter months well."
"Source/Serving: Draft		Smell: Pretty weak. Some dry cocoa nib.		Taste: A little roasty. Pretty fizzy which isn't really common to the style and was as though designed to make up for a lack of flavor. The middle is sweet cocoa and the finish is pretty dry with a hint of roastiness and caramelized malt.		Note: Catchy name but I wish they would have put their creative juices into brewing a better beer."
"Got the whole range of Okocim beers from a local off-license shop... can't believe my eyes... Best before date: 03 Feb. 06.		A: served in a straight pint glass, it pours a light golden to dark straw colour, with a thick and foamy white beer head full of tiny bubbles, which lasts for about a minute.	S: upfront there's a refreshing and smooth smell of grains and lager malts, lightly aromatic and red-apple peel like hop aroma (like lesser version of Saaz); besides that nothing else is particularly noticeable, nonetheless its soft and nice.	T & M: light flavour of bready sweetness upfront, with a mild, corn-like grainy flavour and very faint, apple-like, hoppyness on the palate. In the aftertaste a tinge of very mild bitterness and a thin-mouthfeel of sugary grains remain on the tonguenot pleasant. Overall the mouthfeel is soft and a bit too thin, even watery at times, vis--vis the overall weak flavour, rendering this beer overly light weight than its 5.5%abv. shouldve bring about.	D: compared with its national opponent Zywiec, this beer is way more boring and desperately in need of characters. Not recommended nor impressive."
"A - a golden-brown but slightly off so just OK		S - sweetish little hops, some honey and even spice but somewhat off		T - See above - this is trying to be a Bock type beer but failking miserably		M - medium carbonation, quite refreshing		D - HMMM would not go for this one again - sorry"
"In a pint glass:		More head than i expected, but it did not stick around. Almost no lacing. Not going to lie, based on looks alone I was not looking forward to trying this. Smelled of farm, which was not unpleasant, but there was just nothing else in there. Tasted a little citrus. Again, nothing else. No body at all. Too much carb, even for the style.		Overall: maybe all the marketing has clouded my judgment a bit. I was hoping this would stand up a little better than its American macro peers... but... eh. Pass on this one."
"Live Review. Poured from the brown bomber that I bought at Wine and Beverage Depot in Mentor a few days ago for $10.99. I have seen this beer in stores repeatedly and I guess that I finally ""gave in"" the other day. No ""best by"" or brewed on date observed by me.		A Dark copper translucent body under a light brown creamy head that is short lived...about 2 minutes...but the higher ABV is likely responsible for that. Good, strong look. 4.0		S Very strong hops but also barley malt sweetness as well. Intriguing, this has the makings of one big DIPA. 4.0		T/M The hops and the malt are there but there is also an annoying, overly burdensome bitterness that lingers on the back of my toungue and reminds me of a burlap bag or perhaps scraping my tongue on the bark of a tree. It is really an abrasive bitterness and it is really hard to ignore or overcome. 2.0		D Not really that high due to the unimpressive taste and feel. I admit it was a struggle to finish the bomber. I have had many other DIPAs that were easier to drink than this one. 2.0		Notes: Dissapointed in this one from a local brewer. I really do not appreciate that overly bitter taste in a DIPA. I don't appreciate a lack of ""bottled on"" date. Lastly, it does not help that this beer is so expensive!"
"The weakest 'Imperial' anything	___		A: Deep, dingy clear ruby body with essentially no head.		S: Very weak. Light chocolate and feint earthy hops... that's about it.		T: Syrupy chocolate and embittering hop balancing out to the bitter side. Some burnt malt flavors lurking. Oddly lacing for 11% ABV.		M. Medium creamy.		O: Certainly does not deserve the title 'Imperial'"
Curmudgeon poured a dark amber color, with a small head that didnt stay with the beer too long. It had a very malty smell to it, that wasnt too strong. It had a very strong and malty taste to it. It had a very strong flavor to it as well. It was a bit difficult to drink due to the heavyness, of it and the ABV didnt help. Overall however a fantastic beer, a poster child for the old ale style.
"Bottle. Pours a very dark brown color not unlike rootbeer. A HUGE fluffy tan head that is way bigger than it should be is produced from a normal pour, kind of odd. Dark roasted malt aroma along with a leather smell. Slight coffee notes. Way to light of a mouthfeel. Makes it almost hard to drink. The taste is dark malt and coffee notes and dark chocolate. Very slight hops presence at the end. The taste actually isn't too bad once you get passed the carb. Again, the carbonation on this is way too much and makes it hard to enjoy this beer at all.	I'm sorry, this beer is just not put together well."
"According to the label, Riggwelter is an Old Norse term for a sheep that is on its' back and cannot get up without help, I'll get back to that in a moment.... 		Poured a light, almost clear brown with slight chestnut hue, a hint of cherry hardwood floors gleam. Light brown head, thin, covered the surface with large and small bubbles, nicely carbonated with lacing. The smell of fresh figs and dates predominates, a touch of leather. There is a warm, alcohol taste and mouthfeel, buttery, burnt toffee, I find it harsh. As well, there is a sharp sourness at the roof of the mouth that clobbers your tastebuds and almost provokes a pucker. The aftertaste is not very pronounced, a short finish. 		My impression is of an excess amount of malt that throws the brew off balance, so it's unbalanced like the Riggwelter that it's named after. The beer was certainly crafted this way and likely a good example of the style but I find it unpleasant for the most part so I reflected that in my scores. I didn't like this nearly as much as the Black Sheep Ale I enjoyed recently from the same brewery, usually in good supply at the LCBO."
"So the bartender comes up to me and says ""would you like a little nastiness in your water?"" and I'm like ""sure, I'm always up for something new.""		Normally I'd apply that kind of criticism to shitty American macro's but hey, at least they don't paint themselves as totally superior light beers. American macro's know their places and they're content. But no, ""we're from Amsterdamn. We didn't know light beer was supposed to suck."" Well don't worry, fella's... your beer sucks just fine. In fact, you've got American light beer drinkers all over the place saying ""damn this sucks!"" Congratulations!		By the way, at 3.5%abv, you can't even get the average fat American beer drinker like me drunk. Just what are you trying to pull here, you crazy Dutch bastards?		As far as I'm concerned, the Netherlands can keep Amstel. And Heineken too, Goddammit!"
"A - A nice clear yellow fluid with a white head, actually like a Pilsener.		S - Fruity and a good scent of grains.		T - Not bad, but to light in body so not enough taste.		M - Medium carbonation and a bitter finish.		O - Not bad, but not good either."
"33 cl can from my local grocery store (Hemkp).		Clear light yellow straw color. 	Initally big white bubbly headm fairly lasting. 	A bit malty scent, smells watery, if thats possible...	Distinct watery mouthfel. hard to find much else. 	A bit malty flavour, some fresh fruitiness in the aftertaste. 	Low to no bitterness."
"Got this brew as an extra in a trade with Tilley4		12oz bottle, bottled 3rd week of May '07, served in a standard pint glass.		A - somewhat hazy, orange/brown color with a small tan head that became just a ring in 2 minutes, leaving only a few small spots of lacing.		S - not much on the smell just a slight saaz aroma.		T - flavor is odd, bitter tasting brew that leaves a sweetness on the lips and after taste.		M - thin and light, low carbonation		D - I didn't really care for this one too much."
I'll compare it to 'other' scotch ales, it looks good, smells decent, mouthfeel is subpar, it's too carbonated for the style, alchohol is noticable, taste is initally sweet with a dry finish and a bite of somethng I can't identify. Guess my preference in a scotch ale is silky mouthfeel, malty raisen-y toffee and low alchohol. I love alot of founders ales but this one wasn't one of them.
"A: bright yellow color crystal clear with lots of carbonation bubbling but strangely little head during a hard pour and no lacing.	S: the yeast gives off a sweet banana smell that mixed nicely with citrus and light malt aromas.	T: it has a good taste but it doesn't linger for very long. The banana comes back out in the taste but milder than the smell. There is also some weird chemical taste that I cannot place except to say it tastes like it could clean a toilet.	M/D: the brew felt really watery with a light bitter feel. The drinkability is ok at first I thought that is was pretty good until through trial I found out that you have to let each sip breath before drinking or else the taste is slightly off."
"I am yet to be impressed with this brewery. They need to make some serious changes, but that's just my opinion.		It starts with a decent head but no retention and very little lacing. A red brown colour.		Smell is all malt, sweet, caramel and something unpleasant.		Taste is unbalanced too much sweetness for me. Also has a weird fruity tang. Not worth buying again."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, shared with my friend 3rdrowtailgater. 		It's a nice amber color, two fingers of off-white head. Pretty decent. 		Kind of a weak barleywine flavor. Caramel malts with a hit of hops. It's rich but kinda muted. 		The taste is muted as well unfortunately. There's some smoky malt flavors and biscuity malt. 		It's a little watery, really thin on the mouthfeel. 		Not an exceptionally interesting beer to be honest. I've had it before on locale in Seattle and remember it far more fondly."
This is one of the heavier-bodied beers at the brewery which is disturbing.  The brew is only slightly cloudy and extremely light on flavor.  I have had many wheat brews recently and this is one of my least favorite.
"Appearance: Pours with very little head, which quickly dissipates to little more than a thin ring around the sides of the glass and some small bubbles suspended at the surface in the middle of the glass. Very few bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass, and what ones are there are small. Color is a pretty coppery-orange, and crystal clear. Not much going on with such little (and short-lived) head and so few bubbles rising, but the color almost makes up for it. At 10.5% ABV, I can't complain really... with such a high level of alcohol, the head is bound to be small and short-lived.		Smell: Very sweet and fruity. Strangely, I can also smell pumpkin. I first thought this would make a good Halloween beer when I smelled it. It smells awkward to me, and not quite like the other Belgian beers I had, but there's something I just like about it...		Taste: Alcohol showed up in my first sip, as well as lots of fruity sweetness hinted at by the smell. From then on, the alcohol has moved back some as the fruity flavors kicked in. Very complex and strong flavors. Has a somewhat-strong bite to it. The flavors really come out as it warms up.		Mouthfeel: I would say it's about medium. It's not like water, but then it's not quite like some porters, stouts and weizens I've had either.		Drinkability: Surprisingly high considering the amount of alcohol. However, I would drink this one as a sipping beer; it's strong. Very strong. As I drink more, the drinkability goes down, making it hard to finish this entire bottle. Meanwhile, I can already feel the effects.		Overall, not too bad, but nothing amazing either. I wouldn't mind getting this one again, although I would like to see a six-pack option. As it is currently, it's about 8 bucks for a single, 22oz bottle. That alone makes this a beer to seek out only on occasion, and especially when someone else is around to drink the other half of it. Unfortunately, the Hoppin' Frog beers I want to try the most (Wild Frog Wheat, B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher, and Silk Porter) are not at the local store I go to, but this beer is not a bad first try from this brewery as far as I can tell. I look forward to trying some of their others."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Split with airohead2001. First triple IPA I've ever had...what's with inventing your own category Founder's?		A: Orangish bronze with a  finger head. Not much in the way of head retention, moderate lacing		S: Wow, a lot sweeter than I was expecting given the amount of dry-hopping in this one. Oranges, pine, and some alcohol are the main smells I get.		T: The taste is a ton more bitter than the smell would lead one to believe. Pretty one-dimensional in terms of the hops. Although, the hops aren't much like anything else I've had before. They can't really be classified as either piney or citrusy, but some sort of combination of the two, that doesn't really work that well for me. A tad bit of sweetness to start, but a big, dominating bitterness to finish.		M: Pretty good, but nothing extraordinary. Perhaps a little under-carbonated.		D: To be honest, I wouldn't have wanted more than 6 ounces of this. Pretty extreme in my opinion and not very drinkable."
"12oz bottle, ordered at the Cloverleaf Tavern in Caldwell a few weeks back (the review is culled from tasting notes taken the night of) to help complete their MBA program. This one was served in a chilled pint glass.		Pilsner Urquell pours a crystal clear, radiant gold. It's easy to see how enamored one could be with the look of a beer like this after knowing nothing but dark beers. There's maybe half a finger of white head that manages to leave faint spots of lacing on its way down the glass. There's a certain grainy, bready aroma from the malts, and a definite floral, European hop note as well. Unfortunately, I didn't win the green bottle lottery, as there's also a fairly present skunky aroma. While the skunking was moderate in the nose, it's a bit more prevalent in the taste. It really becomes the defining presence in every sip. I can still taste those same malty and hoppy notes, and I believe there's at least a serviceable pils hidden in there, but this is what happens when you decide to sell your product in less than ideal packaging (green bottles). At least the mouthfeel is unaffected, and is pleasantly light and spry (all the better to finish this beer quickly). Carbonation is a bit dull, failing to help elevate the noble hop flavors. I generally try to be understanding when it comes to blaming brewers for problems with a beer, but if you're going to choose to ship your beers internationally in bottles that don't effectively protect from light exposure, then there's no one else to blame for skunky beer."
"A: Hazy burnt orange with a decent sized head and a lace that doesn't go away. Noticeable carbonation and seems as though it's a thick beer.		S: Very intense notes of cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. It knocked my socks off at first (I was expecting something more like GLBC's Christmas Ale). Slight honey and floral notes but you really have to go deep into the aromas if you want to find them.		T: Way too spiced. The potency of the spices is overbearing and un-enjoyable. I did have a tough time finishing this one. The aftertaste is as strong as the smell and tastes like it, too. 		M: Very rich and creamy with perfect carbonation and a exceptionally smooth finish coming from something that is spiced like this. 		D: I'm not saying that this beer should be avoided, but it's definitely not my style. If they would hold back a couple pounds on the spices I think it would compete with the other top Christmas ales. If you really enjoy the spices that are aforementioned then by all means get this beer."
"650ml bottle	5.0% ABV		I tried this beer on March 18, 2008 after purchasing from my one of local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a beautiful translucent dark red colour with a very thin white head that dissipates quite quickly. The aroma was roasted malt, and some nutty hints. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, with high carbonation. The flavour was all over the place, there was roasted malt, some soapy sourness, and a little hint of bitterness."
"i am updating. it is now january 30, 2010. i have let this beer cellar for six more months. the bottle is marked june of 2008. 		all foam. one half inch poured into the glass and then 12 oz of pure foam. i remembered an old trick of rubbing your finger over your forehead to gather oils. ring this in the foam and it settles. this is the only way to calm this down. oh well.		well i wanted to like it...i wanted to win the super lotto too and that did not happen either.		poured two bottles into three glasses each. that is correct, one bottle and three 16 oz glasses of all foam except a quarter inch of liquid. after 5 minutes they settled to 2/3 head and 1/3 beer. 		appearance = good after 10 minutes, color is good and dark, miserable at start.		smell = good, chocolate and malts.		taste = good cept a little flat...maybe cuz it started as all foam		mouthfeel = not too good...flat		this was marked on the labe as may/jun 2008. i will let the others ""age"" a bit longer and see.		giblet"
"Went to the brewery as part of a Cooperstown Beverage Trail run with some family. On the way out, picked up a mixed 12-pack of all of Cooperstown's offerings.		Poured copper into a nonic with a half inch of white head. The aroma was fruity, with the buttery diacetyl I've come to know and expect from Cooperstown. The butterscotch diacetyl was the main flavor player here, with any malt and hop notes taking a back seat. Not that there were many hop notes to find. Plenty of bitterness, but none of the hop flavors to indicate they were added anywhere but in the beginning of the boil. This brew felt grainy and heavy. In the end, the best way this could be described is by ""bitter butterscotch"". I am a hophead, but in cooking I've learned there's hot spices for flavor, and hot spices for the sake of being hot. Much in the same way, this is hops just for the sake of being bitter, and not for the sake of preserving any hop flavor. Maybe I just hold IPAs to a high standard, but if offered this again, I'm not sure I would take."
"Note: Bottle of this release indicates 5.6% abv.		Pours orange amber with a very thin white head; Nose is orange fruity and a bit like Belgian candi sugar; 		Mouth is nice medium bodied, mild carbonation and well balanced-perhaps needing a bit more carbonation. 		Unfortunately, the flavor profile just isn't pleasant. There is a pine bitter but it's more like an upleasant sour/bitter that is ""heavy"" and burdensome to the flavor - not appealing. There is no brightness, no real character and not a lot of acid to the flavor profile. I don't see this as a match for food at all and not so appealing by itself. Perhaps a bit more carbonation would help? Some who don't like high acid profiles may like this one; however, if you like more than just a simple ""dull bitter"" lager character, this is not the one for you. 		Finish is light/medium bitter pine. All in all, having now had it in the glass for longer than I usually do for a tasting...my conclusion is that more carbonation is likely what this needs and which could salvage it. As is...just to heavy on the palate without any appealing flavors."
This one poured into my glass with a light yellow/orange hue and a bone white head. Smell mostly consisted of yeast with a clove hint. Flavor was dominated by yeast like the smell. Hidden behind the yeast flavor was a light bananna note. This is not a bad beer and is certainly enjoyable on a warm evening, but I found it a little less than average. With so many other outstanding German hefe's out there its doubtful I will buy this one again.
"A- Pours a clear yellow color with a very thin white head that receeded to nothing.		S- Faint grain and loads of alcohol. A bit of yeast and sweetness.		T- Very sweet initially with a solventy finish. The alcohol is quite brash and the overall flavor does little to mask it.		M- Medium bodied with high carbonation. 		D- This one wasn't for me. Too boozy and sweet."
"This one comes up a cloudy golden colour with a short white head. The head settles to a partial film. Gives up some slight lace.		Smells lemony, estery. Malts in there too, but I couldn't find any hops in the glass.		Couldn't honestly recognize this as a pilsner. Tastes more like some sort of perfumy cider. Quite tart, apple-like flavour, lots of esters. The tartness uterlly dominates this beer.		Pilsner? I don't think so. Take a pass on this. Or if you do try it, maybe you can drop me a line and explain it to me."
"I'm definitely a fan of BBC. I've had their beers at the source and in bottles and have always been impressed, until now. I was very excited to try this beer but it was a big disappointment.		Poured in Chimay glasses. 		Color was true to type (orange-yellow hue). No head.		Nose was heavy sweet. A bit of floral characteristics noted. 		Taste had some resemblance of a Belgium trippel but it was way, way too sweet. Alcohol presence was there but the cloying nature really dominated. So much so that I didn't finish the beer.	Almost appeared that the beer needed more attenuation."
"12 ounce bottle - $1.49 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.		Appearance: Pours out a clear, goldenrod-colored body with a medium-sized, frothy, white head.		Smell: Lightly sweet-scented impression of malts and a little whiff of hops. While it doesn't elicit any excitement, I sure as hell have smelled far, far worse in a beer.		Taste: Excruciatingly thin flavor of ultra pale malts imparting a touch of sweetness and a hint of sourish grains. Sparsely spicy hops with just enough light bitterness to be noticed. The finish is both dry, clean, and crisp, but somewhat short, so Amstel Light is a lot like life, really. One minute it's there, and the nex---		Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation. Bordering on being watery.		Drinkability: Sure, it's uninteresting and comes up a tad watery, but it IS a light lager. Harmless and forgettable, if it weren't for these humble notes, I'd be hard-pressed to recall the details."
"Pours a dark amber red with a one finger creamy head. Some lacing.		The smell is very one dimensional malt which is sweet and sugary. Not an overly complex or enticing aroma.		The taste is way too sweet from start to finish. There is almost no hop character to the beer, but the malt isnt complex enough to carry the taste like a brown ale or scotch ale. Quite strange. Very unbalanced.		Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with a pretty low carbonation. Kind of feels flat in the mouth.		The sweetness is too much and makes this beer pretty undrinkable. I could barely finish the can, let alone have another. Add some more damn hops"
"12 oz. bottle provided by beerhandy via BB&B BIF.		Pours a cloudy orange amber. I was expecting something a little more chocolatey in color.		Smells like a chocolate covered cherry. Very inviting.		Tastes mostly like a chocolate covered cherry, but maybe a bit too artificial. It is followed by an almost unpleasant cocoa aftertaste.		Body is just decent. I keep expecting a bigger body by the way that it smells, but it's just a medium bodied ale at heart.		I definitely enjoyed trying this, but would not make it a common guest in my fridge. Just something about the flavoring that doesn't sit quite right with me."
"Had this on 2010-09-10 in Columbia, PA		A - Dark honey with no head but some small bubbles		S - Bourbon, maple, rock candy		T - Pretty intense and too much of everything. Tons of bourbon (not my favorite flavor), too sweet maple, vanilla, honeysuckle. 		M - Medium-heavy body, syrupy. It was effervescent with more carbonation than I expected.		D - I'm in the minority on this one. I really didn't like it. The strong flavors seemed to each fight for prominence. Couldn't finish it although you can tell it was made well with quality ingredients."
"12 oz bottle fresh bottle in a Unibroue tulip glass. 		Pours a light pink with a one finger pink head. 		The first thing that comes to mind is I would not want to be drinking this in a clear glass at some of the rural establishments I'm forced to frequent with my extended family. Defending my honor would most likely be a physical proposition. 		The second thing that comes to mind is, this is different and different is good. 		I'll make a painful comparison to the appearance of a wine cooler. 		The aroma is just not right. It's musty and lacks identity. It has a canned fruit essence to it, but I can't pick up what kind of fruit. 		First couple of sips and I get a strong cherry pie filling flavor. I eat a lot of fresh cherries in the summer so I don't automatically associate cherries with pie filling. 		Not overly sweet but it does have a tart tang finish. 		A unique beer that I appreciate as well done, just not to my tastes."
22 ounce bottle. Double IPA with 168 theoretical IBUs. Okay then, let's do this. I'm not afraid of a little thing like IBUs. Poured a bit into my snifter. Color is a nice deep mahogany red with very little, if any head. swirling the beer a bit results in a sticky and finely etched lacing on the sides of the glass. Let's take a sniff of this bad boy. You get a hops invasion from the nose. Seems like all the classic hop flavors are there - pine first, then citrus, followed by floral. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky, and the first taste gives you a clear sense of this bitterness that you're about to endure. First taste is just an assault on the palate. Resin, pine, citrus, hops just attacking you from all sides. There's absolutely no malt - or anything else for that matter - to back up the barrage of hops that you're dealing with. Finishes with a prolounged and almost painfull bitterness. Never thought I would say this, but there's just too much hops to deal with. I've long been a fan of IPAs but this thing is just too extreme, which leaves me almost incredulous. Honestly it's not fun to drink this - I'm having trouble just finishing my few ounces in my sinfter. Seems like Hopping Frog went out of their way to make the most extreme and inaccessible DIPA that they could. If that's what they were going for then they succeeded.
"Trafalgar. I do not for the life of me understand why they are still in business. This is another bottle of weird funk.		Interesting colour - like a blood orange. Moderate head to partial film and some spotty lace. Cherry smell only vaguely reminiscent of a cherry lambic. Absolutely brutal taste. Some sort of nasty metallic, wood alcohol-like thing happening. Thin and unpleasant mouthfeel. Very wooden and chemical in character.		I'm to where I only buy a Trafalgar to add another notch to my beer belt. I'm way past expecting these guys to come up with anything decent.		Ew."
OK, so maybe I got a skunked version of this beer, but drinking this was truly a nauseating experience. It had really bad skunky aroma, the taste was bitter and the mouthfeel made me want to puke. I would re-review this if I got a decent example, but I am not sure I ever want to lay eyes on another one of these nasty brews again. If the beer was spoiled in transit, then maybe the brewers want to rethink their bottling/distributorship/label dating. This was an awful, awful beer.
"Think I'll pass on the ""big love"" from the land of zion. Poured with a decent , off white head that lasted and some lace. Color was clear medium amber. Aroma was caramel, malt, and dominated with solvents. Flavor was like nose and overly sweet. Body was thin and carbonation was ok. Finish is like flavor and not a repeater. Could be a ploy to discredit ZOG."
"12.30.09 at The Ambassador.		A: glad I couldn't see light, flat yellow through the brown glass		S: even gladder I couldn't smell the (bad) skunky scent		T: definitely tastes like something is missing; the flavor isn't all there		M: tighter carbonation could have balanced the light body		D: Had it at $2 Tuesdays. What did you expect?"
"Reviewed 12/22/10.	22oz bottle for $10 @ Bottles in Spokane, WA		2007 vintage poured from bottle to snifter.		A: Little to no head development, as expected from this three year ale. Shows dark copper ale with consistent stream of bubbles which dissipate almost immediately to the atmosphere.		S: Caramel, vanilla, pine, figs dominate this ale. Multifaceted, this beer gives at different levels. As my nose moves from the lowest point to highest, each primary characteristic owns a layer and mends with the background. Excited to taste.		T: Bitter. Too bitter. At three years of age, I expect BW's to develop a level of sweetness accentuated with the finest details of the specialty malts mixed into the backbone, but not here. If you can trudge through the mud of bitter thorns, you'll find orange rinds, vanilla, resin, grapefruit.		M: Low carbonation, slick feeling, puckers my buds with the bitterness. Sad thing. I swallow and it makes me develop a low level mucus bolus (similar to a loogy after milk).		D: At $10, and three years of development, this beer should at least be better than average. At this juncture, I feel bad I snatched up all three bottles they had, and gave two away for Xmas. Now I'm have to apologize. 		All this being said, maybe this beer is great fresh. Given the amount of hops obviously used early in the boil, one would hope they followed through with more mid boil and finishing hops for more body flavor. For now though, can't hang with this one from a brewery with great beers."
"Honey golden with a fizzy off-white head that quickly shrinks to a film. Odd cinnamon and fermented apple notes in the aroma. Wow you gotta love Lithuanian Malt Liquor to enjoy Zhiguly Grande because that is exactly what it is, a high octane pale lager. ""The most heating and famous beer of beer country!"" is proudly displayed on the bottle. The flavor is cidery and strong with plenty of fusel alcohol for a decent burn on the way down. Full bodied, borderline syrupy mouthfeel. This one is tough to drink."
"big-bubbled head that gets chased away by alcohol, leaving slight lacing. clear amber color with nice columns of CO2 rising	malty start with a dry finish that doesn't hide the alcohol heat. nutty aftertaste with a hop bitterness that i couldn't put a finger on		this stuff reminded me of samichlaus (in a much subdued and toned-down way, of course). a previous reviewer described it as polish malt liquor and i'd have to agree. sort of a bigger crazy horse"
"the bottle i had was six weeks past the ""best before"" date, so im not sure if that affected this beer. 	the color was a dark shade of gold.	what im not sure about is the flavor/aroma. it wasnt real bad but wsa stonger than i expected. the roasted/malt/caramell flavor and aroma just didnt seem right. maybe im wrong but i expected more of a subdued beer from a pilsner."
this was my first taste of imported beer at a robust age of sixteen, I was stepping up in the world. I didn't like this gargage 14 years ago and I don't like it now. Its funky, skunky, way to bitter and almost impossible to drink. The bottle does not help, this should be canned and served next to carlsberg.
"This beer is all about context. 		For example, if one is lucky enough to findthemselves in Aruba, this isn't a bad option. 		The pickings are fairly slim, most of the beer is one variation of bland pilsner, as opposed to a different bland pilsner. If left with the choice of Balashi or Amstel Bright, go with the Balashi, it is cheaper, and as long as it is ice cold, it is drinkable.		Now, if you are going out of your way to actually buy Balashi and you are not lucky enough to be in Aruba, than I have nothing for you.		This beer is bland, with no real distinctive qualities to speak of. If it is really cold, it is drinkable, but it is never anything more than a boring, mass produced, kinda of skunky tasting pilsner.		Then again when one is in Aruba, if the only thing you have to complain about is the fact that there is no great beer, than you should probably just go with the flow and keep your pie hole shut."
"A - Pours a nice golden yellow color, cloudy due to roused yeast, and a creamy white head.		S - Strong smell of bananas, slight bubblegum and clove, but could use more. Also slight rubber-like aroma.		T - The taste was a bit of a let down, the banana dominates and is accompanied by a slight soapy flavor.		M - Good carbonation and a nice creamy body. Good for style.		Overall, I was not impressed by this beer. The flavor profile was too estery and not enough phenolic to back it up."
"a: This was a deep ruby red color, not quite black. It poured with a smallish tan head that faded quickly.		s: Muted aromas of malts, oak, bourbon, and very faintly, vanilla. The wood aromas take center stage, unfortunately.		t: This isn't bad at all, just kind of bland. Smokey malt and wood flavors dominate. There is little if any bourbon flavor to be found.		m: This was under carbonated, but viscous enough.		d: This was okay, but once was enough for me. My buddy and I compared this blind with barlewinebrewer's bourbon infused Russian Imperial Stout. It wasn't even close, the homebrew won easily."
Clear 40 oz. bottle. Straw yellow in color, with lots of visible carbonation when opened. Smell is of Corny skunk and a large dose of alcohol. Taste is really dominated by the high amount of alcohol and the cheap ingredients that were used to brew this swill (That is actually kind of insulting to swine). A cheap buzz, for sure, but will leave you hungover without fail.
Pours a clear golden honey like color with a thin head and a decent amount of lace. The aroma is of an unknown sweetness and grains. The taste is of grains with a slight buttery taste at the end. The nouthfeel is creamy and full it is very nice. The drinkability is ehhh its a tough drink and you could only have one.
"37.5 cl can poured into beer stein		white head quickly dissipating to almost nothing, leaving no lacing		aroma is of malts, hay, some sweetness; better than most euro pale lagers		flavor is quite sweet, a light barley flavor, but not too much else going on		overall, a bit chemical-tasting, but much cleaner and crisper than the standard pale lager - is it the can vs. green bottle, is it being in Europe vs. the US? considering it is cheaper than most similar Spanish lagers, it is a clear step above."
Served with a thin fine (going flat?) white head and lots of lace. Color is a very clear amber. Flavor's common world beer and at least it's not overly sweet as is so common these days. Flavor's malt and a teensy bit of hop and corn. Finish is corn/rice beer. A real yawner. Session if you like headaches.
"12oz stubby bottle (Think Sierra Nevada's bottles), A fantastic label with a painted portrait of, what else, an old curmudgeon looking scholar/sailor.		Color: Brown, I wouldn't say deep brown. Head is a beige pillowy head, with medium retention.		Smell: Alcohol, Malty Sweetness, little hops		Taste: Malty alcohol that hints at some hops. That aged flavor that hints of bourbon. But always alcohol, the kind that leaves you dry and wondering ""...is this really only 9.8% ABV?""		Overall: Eh, I could have done without it the 9.8% ABV. I appreciate the work and effort that was put into this Ale but let's face it; at this high of an alcohol content you may just as well have a barley wine. Not my favorite."
"D'you know how sometimes you're just fixing for a cheap thrill? Everything in life has become monotone and broing. Work sucks, the summer heat is stifling and the air conditioner is on the fritz and the only daylight hours you have are spent in a cubicle? You leave the office and arrive at the bar bedraggeld and miserable from the rain to see a 15% beer on the menu. 'That's my horse', you think, 'something that will help me forget all this shit and move on to brghter sunlit uplands. Then you dig a bit deeper to find out that this beer comes from the worst brewery in the province (and you include molson and labatt in that judgement). 'To hell with it', you say, 'its still cheaper than rubbing alcohol'.		A 200ml bottle arrives at my table, bedecked with a label made on a dot matrix printer. Standard Trafalgar classiness. I work in marketing, so I'm therefore a b*stard who is trying to sell you shit. Trafalgar's marketing team are incompetent b*stards who are trying to sell you shit. In space, no one can hear you scream. In a bar no one can hear the sound of escaping carbonation as this bottle is opened. Looks like another under-carbonated gem. Indeed nothing disturbs this beer, and its surface is as still as Walden Pond. Well, Walden Pond if it was the colour of medium steeped tea. Carbonation usually aids the nose by propelling some of the aroma upwards. Fortunately this beer has enough sugar and alcohol to overcome that lack. Corn syrup, treacle, ripe berries and booze. Its like you've let a hobo loose in the kitchen and told him to come up with a dessert.		Taste is something like a sherry? Actually, no... it reminds me of the port I drank one new year's. The cheap one I drank a whole bottle of before spraying the room with a pizza dipping sauce after an unfortunate incident involving a ceiling fan. The booze isn't as obvious as it is in the aroma, partially because liquid diabetes is ably masking it. Bizarrely it doesn't even feel like 15%, but if you think you can get looped off 200ml I don't trust your judgment anyway. The syrupy texture may not be to everyone's liking - it wasn't to mine. I like a good barleywine as much as the next guy, and I expect a heavy body. Somehow most barleywines carry it well. While Korruptor is no barleywine it also lacks that grace. Its like a fat woman in a skinny dress.		You know what, though? It actually wasn't all that bad..."
"pours clear golden yellow with no head		smells of grainy cereal malts		taste is like the nose sweet cereal grains no hops		mouthfeel is way to heavy for the style and there was very little carbonation		drinkability not good - a very boring brew and i will not be buying this again"
"Friend of mine told me of the Costco beer, so I handed him a 20 spot and a week later he delivered me a variety case from his local Costco. $20 for a case is a great value, so it would be hard to be disappointed even if my expectations are modest.		A - Golden amber in color. I am surprised that it is a bit deeper in color than I expected. Beer is hazy, but not cloudy. The bottle had no yeast sediment, I am guessing that it is filtered. Head was 1/2"" white and fluffy. Slowly receded to cover the surface and laced the glass where it once was.		S - Mild grain sweetness. Hints of wheat. Hops are not noticeable at this point. I am guessing that the finish will be a bit sweet and cloying. We will see.		T - Sweet with hints of caramel malts. Hops are noticeable but restrained. I cannot tell if the hops are American or European, suggesting that they were added nearer the beginning of the boil rather than the end. The finish is not cloying and sweet as I expected, but there is an odd soapy quality to the finish that hits the back of your tongue and throat. No hint of clove or banana esters that I could detect, that is fine for an American interpretation of a Hefe.		M - Mouthfeel is nice. Mid gravity(1.051 or so?). Creamy and full.		D - I don't think that this would be refreshing on a hot day. Not too drinkable back to back.		Overall it is a so-so beer. If I had to guess, I don't think that the wheat comprised of 50% of the grain bill. Maybe 30-40%? Not a big fan of the American wheat style. I never know what to expect and the style guidelines are all over the place. I do think that 'Hefeweizen' on the label is a bit misleading. Hefe translates to yeast and weizen suggests wheat, but neither are really perceptible to me. American Wheat would be a more appropriate style since American Wheat doesn't really have any boundaries or expectations."
"I have to admit, amongst the plethora of English ales available here, the marketing shtick on this one won my ""I Fart in Your General Direction""-addled brain over.		This beer poured an attractive clear golden-brown hue, with a substantial head. The nose on this beer was more queer than Michael Palin's sense of humour. It's fruity, to be sure, of the fermented variety, but the type is hard to pin down. It is reminiscent of perry, so I'll say pears. It actually smells quite good. The taste is quite a divergence - malty, but bitter, and not in a good hoppy manner. It's thin, with a funky vegetal flavour, and a bland cereal character. The carbonation is also on the high side. The finish is moderately astringent, not particularly pleasant.		There are too many weird, non-complementary things going on in this brew, which may work for its label namesakes, but not for the stuff in the bottle."
"The white lace creeps up the glass and sticks where it can. Shimmering weathered golden hue.		Powdery hay malt aroma with an ample amount of leaf hop for the nose to take in.		Metallic graininess off of a carbonate like carbonation, ouch what a bite! After that subsides the flavour is decimated and does not come back other than a sweetness that lingers into the after taste.		Astringent almost to the point of being undrinkable. I&#8217;ll pass on this one, there are other Euro lagers that are much better than this one."
"Served from the bottle into a tulip glass.		A- Dark brown pour with ruby undertones and half a finger tan head.		S- Alcohol comes in very strong in the aroma, very light butterscotch and caramel notes. 		T- Some sweet caramel, strong alcohol, medicinal taste, and some bitterness		M- Syrupy, sticky, a little chewy, full bodied beer, definitely has a strong warming and burning alcohol effect 		O- Just too boozy to be very drinkable. This is the first beer I've had from Founders that disappointed me. This drinks more like a hard liquor than a beer with the booziness and burning effect. The alcohol is too prominent in this beer to the detriment of everything else going on with it. This is much boozier than Russian Imperial Stout's and Barleywines I have had. More flavor characteristics came out as the beer warmed quite a bit, but by then I was over this beer."
"Appearance: Poured from a bottle into a beer mug. It has an amber red tint with a small white foamy head. 		Smell: Slightly sweet with an alcohol smell. Doesn't smell like a great beer. Smell is not very appealing.		Taste: Strong fruity taste. I can taste apple and honey. Alcohol is strong and beer is not complex. I do not like the taste, it is hard to drink.		Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation that seems kind of syrupy. Seems smooth and easy.		Taste: I bought it because it was a Lithuanian beer, thought it would be interesting to try. It is unbalanced and seems too sweet for a beer. Not what I was expecting. It is kind of boring and not complex. Not very good and probably won't try again."
This beer is best served over vanilla or peach ice cream. As a component in a beer float, it can be tasty. It can also work when mixed with juice. (I liked it when mixed with an orange juice/carrot juice combo.) Unfortunately, it's more difficult to drink straight. Although I enjoy fruity beer such as lambics, I was not overly impressed with Founders Cerise when drunk as-is. The beer's flavor has the cherry taste and not much else, more like a juice-flavored kid's drink than a fruit beer. I would have appreciated more nuance of flavor.
"A - Looks like dark cola, with no head and lots of carbonation.	S - Smells mostly fruity and herby like cherry coke or Brio.	T - Tastes mostly of Jagermeister-like herbs giving it an almost identical taste to Brio cola. Hints of dark berries come through, but hops do not.	M - Very watery and fizzy, once again a lot like coke.	D - Hard to finish."
"Terminal Gravitys brewpub is small. Its actually an old house with just a tiny improvised bar in a space that might have once functioned as a family dining room. Smallness is part of Terminal Gravitys charm and there is only one refrigeration unit for all four of their kegged beer varieties. But it must be said; its simply set too low  especially for stout  and their beers are invariably served too cold. (My recurrent peeve.) 			So drinking my Bar X Stout was a slow, deliberate process. Had to wait awhile. Regrettably, the wait did nothing to maximize the qualities of my stout. Bar X has a dry, chocolaty nose, a thin, sandy head and is 99% opaque with dirty brown shadows. It has a clean finish and sustained roasty aftertaste, but these properties were forced to compete with more than a little problematic drift on the middle palate and a final punctuation of dead weight on the tongue. Likewise, the aroma is infused with parallel detractions.			Ultimately I couldnt cozy to this beer. It presented a nice crown of lace, but the taste was confused by what appeared to be fine ingredients corrupted by technical brewing problems."
"Appearance - 3.0	A finger of bubbly white head reduced over a slightly hazy straw coloured body.		Smell - 2.0	Sweet with lots of cardamom, a little lemon zest.		Taste - 2.0	Essentially this is a spiced wheat ale, not dissimilar in taste from some Belgian pale ales. The added cardamom overwhelms the sweet malt base to the point that it is hard to determine other flavours. Quite refreshing.		Mouthfeel - 3.0	Carbonation is quite fine and persistent, although the over spiciness 		Drinkability - 2.0	While refreshing in hot weather, this get increasingly hard to drink as the palate tires of the cardamom.		OVERALL - 2.3	Perhaps someone from Matso's should have a look at the Barons beer with native ingredients, which are used to compliment an existing beer style rather than overwhelm it. Is this a beer or a cardamom infusion?"
"Chilled bottle into a glass. A generous extra from Alen. Thanks man! 		A: Pours a murky, unfiltered amber color with an inch of off-white head and fairly short retention. The remnant is a collar around the brew, which leaves register marks as I sip. 		S: Way better than last year's, which was very solventy (at least the bottle that I had was). Caramel, toffee: sweet dark crystal malts remind me of a barleywine. It's still hoppy, with a nice grapefruit aroma, some herbs and grass. It also seems to have some English hops in there; I'd recognize that stale, sweaty towel aroma anywhere. 		T: A citrus salad of pineapple, orange, tangerine, and lemon. A pine and grassy herbal note are found in the mid-taste, giving way to old towel hops in the finish. There is an undercurrent of toffee throughout with some caramel, reminding me of a barleywine -- but the hops definitely dominate. A drying finish (could just be the alcohol burn) with some lingering resiny bitterness and chalk. 		M: Slightly heavier than medium bodied. While the ABV is not burning, you definitely feel its warmth, and it forces you to slow down. The carbonation is moderate, and it cleanses the palate decently well. Points off for the chalky aftertaste though. 		D: I told myself last year that I should try it again before writing it off for good. I did, and I have. I don't know what people like about this beer, but it's not for me."
"A: Pale golden color with white head.. tons and tons of carbonation.		S: A bit of spice, a bit of skunk. Not sure if this is a bad bottle or the regular smell..		T: A little bit of spice and hops in the background..not great, not horrible.. a solid average..		M: Lots of carbonation, and a little bite.		D: Pass. Not my favorite style, and this one isn't changing my mind.. I read a lot of people really like it, but judging from this experience, I am not sure why."
I'm sad to give this a low score after hearing so many good things about it. Poured from a keg tapped just 4 days prior, it looked very promising with it's staying head, and deep body. The nose brought a strong hop smell but a predominant smell of body odor. The taste is the same with some sweet malt flavors and hop bitterness and pine resinous feelings/flavors. I say this from a very objective standpoint as I was looking forward to trying this beer for the first time, but I must say, a disappointment.
"With a little message ""will this beer live up to your expectations?"" I eagerly uncap and pour this beer into my 10 ounce pint glass. Its the perfect match-up while viewing the end of the MLG finals. 		Great head formation, TONS of lilypad formations of carbonation seen from above, and a thick white collar. The retention of the head is minor, unfortunately. It laces appreciably, but nothing spectacular. Cold honey colored body makes me wonder about this beer.		Oh, what is that aroma? It is so familiar. I am trying ever so hard to pinpoint it. It is so familiar. I know this flavor. Its so familiar... Its bright butterscotch and caramel with some similarities to fruity pebbles. Relatively clean and singular. Monochromatic with the butterscotch sweetness being almost over attenuated. It also smells insanely similar to a Diet Chocolate Soda my grandma absolutely killed for. What the hell was that name... Google revealed it to be Canfield's. Shit was absolutely TERRIBAD.		Do not like. Nope. Definitely not. Opens up sweet, strong sweetness. Juice level of sucrose here. It starts out sharp sweetness that reminds me of a simple syrup with tartness. It becomes tangible and identifiable as a butterscotch and caramel flavor erupts and... cocoa? Is that really... no... it... It is! Aspartame mingled in a cocoa flavoring. I swear if you poured canfield's into a bottle and resealed it... It peaks quite fast and dissipates before I have ease of interpretation. It takes many sips to understand just what this beer resembles. Finish is clean for the most part with a cellulosic nature. Very simple, but not what I would call tasty. For all of its identifying flavors, they aren't the gourmet or desirable types. 		Take your favorite memory of sucking on a hard butterscotch candy given to you by your ever-generous great aunt after she slaved away making these amazing little confections. Then imagine she sold the recipe in the best interests of sharing her love with the world to a blood-sucking, heartless conglomerate who turned it into a mass-produced generic lump of terror that children can buy for a few nickels. That end-product resembles what I imagine the bland interpretation of these classic flavors to be. Flea market brand butterscotch candy dipped in expired cocoa powder packet from a mystery box.		Thin, watery, and disjointed. Nothing mingles, just stages that are clearly defined from one another by slaps to my tongue. Lacks the power to linger on my palate, but leaves me feeling like a piece of hair floated and stuck to my lips. Annoying, in short.		I do not like this beer. I imagine this as being a kill shot, I really really think it is. I think of this as just an ale brewed with maybe honey or butterscotch drizzle? Whatever it is, I would not like to try this again if possible.		O'fallon Cherry Chocolate beer. Natural flavors my ass! This tastes absolutely horrendous. I think I may appreciate Canfield's Chocolate Fudge soda a bit more than this beverage. I understand the sharp sweetness at first to be the cherry, and the more I realize it the more I understand this definitely tastes like aspartame, cheap cocoa, and cheap beer all in one glass."
I'm a huge IPA fan, but this one is not for me. Pours a pretty amber, a little darker than most IPA's, and leaves a thick, foamy head. Smell is definitely hoppy, which didn't suprise me given the claims of this brew's hopping process. Taste is just a bit too bitter for me, even for an IPA. Has an almost winelike finish and aftertaste, which may be due to the high 9% ABV. Gotta sip this one, but there are many better IPA's out there...
"12 oz can out of a minibar hotel fridge (this was a $7.00 mistake. Should've opted for the $9 Chivas Regal...)		A: Really clear and chicken broth-like.		S: Smells somewhere between the spent grains at a BMC brewery tour and the pile of old beer cans your neighbor leaves out behind their house on a hot summer day.		T: Tastes like the smell, but cold.		M: Carbonation is welcome as it seems to move the awful flavors off of your tongue as quickly as possible.		D: No."
"Pours out a gold ,moderately carbonated brew.Seems very ""thick"". Not a whole lot of head, i poured it pretty hard too. Pretty weak smell, mildly phenolic with a whiff of oranges. Very bold taste,,a little too tart for me. Mouthfeel is slick, ok in this department. Drinkablity is ok at best, an ok beer probably not one i would buy again.Taste is a little too over the top. Alcohol at 9% is well concealed."
"A - Pours black but not opaque with no head.		S - Chocolate, roastiness. Very mild.		T - Chocolate. Mustiness. Harsh sourness in the aftertaste. Some coffee.		M - Medium carbonation. Thin. Watery.		D - Noooo thanks. This brewery still hasn't impressed me."
Pilsner Urquell is a popular beer where I work, but to me it is more of a taste that needs to be acquired. The actual taste wasn't bad, it was the aftertaste, it left a very bitter after taste to me, I am not one for bitterness in my beer. The look of this beer is great, it is a golden beer and very clean.
"Appearance: Pours a pitch black color with a blanket of tan foam - a decent patchwork of lace, too		Smell: Sour aromatics compete with the oaky barrel		Taste: Very woody and dry, with a developing sour character; underneath, the chocolate, coffee and dark fruit flavors can be discerned, but the sourness and the oak battle for prominence both before and after the swallow		Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation		Drinkability: I didn't get the gusher reported by others but this bottle (bought in Seattle in the spring of 2009) clearly has some off flavors; some have suggested that the sourness was the brewers intent - possibly so, but it sure isn't marketed that way so I am not sure I believe that"
Out of all of the different brews made by Weltenburger, this is one of the few that is actually brewed on sight at the Kloster. The rest are brewed in Regensburg. I had this at the brewery in Kelheim and was pretty disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high after drinking the best dark beer in the world as of 2008, but even that can't explain how off the taste was. It comes in a normal lager glass with a small head that quickly disapprears. The color is a dark brown with some tints of red towards the bottom. It has an incredibly sweet smell with some hints of alcohol, but the two don't really go together in the taste. It quickly fades from being sweet to sour.
"Beer bottle (33 cl.), tasted in 2011.		Appearance : golden color with a white foamy head (with nice lacing).	Smell : sweet malty aroma.	Taste and mouthfeel : sweet, watery with a lightly hoppy finish.	Drinkability : a not impressed beer in the style lager."
"Pours an orangish amber color with plenty of light coming through.		Smell is malty with flowery undernotes.		Taste is thinner than expected, almost not like a beer. Hints of berrries, grass in the midst, and a flat finish with bitter tinge. Heather? or maybe some sort of chamomile/minty flavor in the front to middle of each sip.		Goes down pretty easty, although the taste is not my bag. For being a Wee Heavy, I expected more viscosity and more to the body and flavor of the beer. Likely wouldn't have another, just not my mug of brew."
"On tap at Capone's yesterday.		Clear orange in color, my 13oz pour of this beer shows excellent clarity and a thin white head is present, receding to a disk rather quick, leaving a little lace. The nose is great, really reminding me of Double Trouble, with citrus and pineapple present with plenty of bright citrus character. Malt character is reserved/non-existent. As this beer warms up, the vanilla and bourbon grow in strength, along with a mild caramel sweetness. The flavor palate opens with a strange combination of hop flavor and booze. The hop character is quite excellent, with pineapple,citrus, lemon and floral character. Malt sweetness is minimal. Vanilla and bourbon are present mid-palate, with the booze lingering on the finish. Bitterness is low, this is all about the flavor hops. The light body, medium carbonation and great hop flavor with low bitterness make for an extremely drinkable beer, but the bourbon heat just detracts from what is an excellent base beer. Why does a DIPA need to be aged in a bourbon barrel?	look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | drink: 3.5	Reviewed on: 11-28-2009 17:57:09		*Edit: I tried it again at Pizzeria Paradiso on 25 July 2010. The bourbon and oak just don't do it for me, there's too much heat, vanilla and tannins. I couldn't drink more than 2 sips. I'm reducing scores accordingly"
"This is a very malty sweet beer tastes more like an amber or brown. It is not true to the IPA style the sweet alcohol flavor dominates. Even for a DIPA it is syrup not much hop flavor. I would not buy this beer again.		A - good amber color	S - ok mostly sweet alcohol 	T - sweet and boozy 	M - thin light carbonation	D - low at 10% and too sweet and cloying"
"pours a beer bottle brown with a small tanish head that leaves a little lacing.		smells faint of some fresh chocolate with a hint of cherry and caramel. almost like a candy.		taste is better than expected you definitly taste the cherry with some chocolate moderate carbonation.		mouuthfeel doesnt remind me of a ""beer"" but more like candy with some beer in it but isnt horrible.		this beer is not all that drinkable because of the candy kick to it but i did finish it so it isnt all that bad just not my cup of beer.... i mean tea ha ha"
"Best before 1/13/05		Appearence: Pours a nice, clear dark copper. It seems a bit dark for the style, but all-in-all acceptable. The head is frothy and off-white. Big bubbles flow up from the bottom of the glass.		Smell: Wonderful, earthy malts arise with a great bready, grainy smell that's dead on. Balance is supreme. Crisp and clean smelling.		Taste and Mouthfeel: The taste is bland. I don't know how else to put it. It's not bad tasting, it's just boring, and has nothing that you'd hope from the smell of it. The bready-ness of the smell has almost dissapeared, and turned into a cereal/corn type flavor. The aftertaste is border-line gross. The mouthfeel, on the other hand, is clean, crisp, and smooth.		Drinkability: This one has the potential to be a solid Oktoberfest beer, but unfourtunatly, it doesn't shine through like it should. It's not bad, but I'd rather go for a Sam Adams O-fest, and I never thought I'd have to choose SA over Stoudt's. Hmmm..."
"A- burnt orange in color, decent froth that sticks for a minute and fades to a tiny web		S- Citrus undertones, mild caramel		T- Taste was a disappointment for a DIPA. Tastes of burnt hazlenuts, burnt malts, very very low hops, mildly burnt citrus. looked for a born-on date to cancel out the stale beer taste, but didn't find any on the packaging or label		M- light mouthfeel, light to medium carbonation, ABV leaves an oily feeling and afertaste of burnt oil 		D- this has a reasonably low drinkability due to the overwhelming burnt taste. typically with DIPA there isn't a huge overwhelming burnt malt taste, DIPA's provide a good pack of hop flavors to balance out the alcohol burn. This beer fails huge, it's not bad, just a disappointment for a DIPA. Will not purchase this one again."
"Appearance: light brownish gold, good clarity, poor head development and not much retention of the little that does form		Aroma: light bubblegum fruitiness, toasty maltiness, hint of spent coffee grinds (?), skunky (clear bottle)		Flavor: dryish malt base with a grainy edge, crisp hops and a refreshing subtle bitterness, finishes clean and dry		Mouthfeel: light body, crisp but soft texture		Other comments: Probably quite divine from a cask, but a bit of a dead dog from this clear glass bottle."
Thanks to Matt for setting a couple of these aside for me today. Nemesis 2010 pours out a very dark brown, almost black with little more than a small white lacing. Big whiff of hops and honey up front, with some figs and a strong alcohol perfume. Damn, the taste is straight on booze and hops, a real palate bruiser that leaves a very bitter ending. The body is very big, making it a slow sipper along with the somewhat intense, almost acrid flavor profile. Drinkability? Not so great right now, but I could see this one developing quite nicely with a couple years of age to it. I felt the same way about the 09, but unfortunately I drank all of my supply. This one I am going to hold on to and revisit a ways down the road.
I just had this brew and I must say, very smooth and tasty beer. Something that an individual could really drink a lot of and not fill up and at 4.99 a six pack a fairly cheap alternative to beers like bud and coors. Overall an average beer, even though it isn't the best tasting, overall I suppose the novelty of the beer could be considered appealing.
"529th review on BA	Bottle to Pint		Consumed 5/30/11		App- A darker yellow with a one finger head to it, no cling.		Smell- Lager yeast was in there but not much aroma at all.		Taste- A very basic lager that was brought back from Poland by my wife's uncle. It was bad it was just I think their version of bud light but tastier		Mouth- Light bodied and high carbed. A lot of bubbles.		Drink- Nice to try something from overseas. I wont have again, just a bit bland. Nothing to get excited about."
"Poured into a snifter		Appearance: very pale yellow, one fourth finger head that dissipates rather quickly. Good lacing		Smell: Citrus, lemon; summery		Taste: Light hops, grass stains, citrus, with a dry finish		Mouthfeel: light, watery		Overall: Thought this one would have more of a kick, but it just never got off the ground. A bit better as it warmed. Just not impressed."
"I had a four ounce sample at the 2007 Oregon Brewers Festival. It was billed as a ""Belgium-style Tipel"" so I made it the first beer sampled among the 70 or so available at the festival. I and my drinking buddy were sorely disappointed. It was more of a tripple IPA that was so hopped up that it sucked the joy out of my mouth. Of the 42 beer sampled during our visit to the festival it received our worst rating.		A: It was a bright gold with a tinge of orange. An abundant head that quickly disappeared leaving no lacing (not necessarily the fault of the beer given the plastic mugs used to serve beer at the festival). 		S: It smelled of freshly mowed grass...very green and hoppy. I could detect (barely) a hint of malty sweetness. But it was buried under the mountain of hops.		T: If a beer could suck the life out of your mouth this one accomplished the task. The bitterness of the hops left a bitter residue that took severely of the following beers to wash from my mouth. The bite was definitely worse that the bark! I'm not a hop head...if I were this might be the beer for me...I have a friend that swears by TGs products and he cannot get enough IBUs crammed into his brews.		M: Ouch. But for the cool liquid I would say this was as close to a dry white wine as any beer I have every experienced. Thin and aggressively carbonated. It was like drinking a sour green apple fizzy.		D: Never again.		Comment: I rarely drinky beers with and IBU above 30 so my review is tainted by my timid palate. My main problem was the advertisement of this beer as a Belgium style Tripel...it was anything but a Tripel...except possibly a Tripple Hop Extravaganza. If you love the flavor of hops, bitter beer or a beer that bites you from the first to last sip...this beer is for you.	Orange gold color. A full-bodied triple. Malty and hoppy. Rich flavor, although very strong. Aged in oak and it taste like it. Rich mellow oak tannins. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp and slightly dry. Aftertaste is bitter. No alcohol bite despite 8.4% alcohol. Interesting beer."
"In a large tulip glass, Mean Manalishi glows crimson-tinted copper-amber with a bit of haze and a pretty pitiful scuzz of large, off-white bubbles on top-- not foam, mind you, but plain-old milk-style bubbles that have no place atop a DIPA.... near-zero retention, minimal specks of lacing.		The smell does a little to redeem the drink, with soft caramel notes backing sweet fruity whiffs of pineapple and green citrus.		The taste is caramel-forward with a burnt note of lime zest and cola nuts with a mean backbone of unflavored bitterness. Alcohol provides a splash of welcome apple-juicy fruitiness to the brew, but then sucks it all back in a wash of chemical-style palate drying and another bitter blast of neutralizing non-fruity, non-grassy, non-spicy, non-pleasant hoppiness. Alcohol warming is the brew's one redeeming factor that I'll note, especially on a chilly evening like this one. More watery caramel emerges as the drink warms.		The drink is medium-bodied and on the bubble-free side of ""flat as all Hell"". Hoppin' Frog is new in NC, so the bottle isn't likely to be very old, but my visit with Mean Manalishi was pretty unsatisfying, and I'll most certainly pass on it next time."
"Presentation: Sampled at Fernandes Brewery Tap in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Plain white rectangular pumpclip has the words Goldie Hops. Listed at 3.4% ABV.		Appearance: Pale golden yellow with creamy white body as it settled, highly carbonated. Once at rest the bleached white head which had a finger thick tight creamy head with good retention throughout.		Nose: Biscuit malts in the background but lots of hops and floral aspects. Refreshingly crisp with an overall character that is very fruity.		Taste: Delicate to say the least, feint whiffs of hops and a little sweet Munich like malts. Its all very low key, weak flavors and a taste profile that seems watered down. 		Mouthfeel: Whilst the conditioning was perfect it could not do anything to offset the very thin body and weak feel that the Goldie Hops presented.		Drinkability: A 3.4% brew is typically pitched nicely into the Session arena, but this one is a little too thin and the tastes far too weak to maintain interest in the long term. 		Overall: Im a big fan of Fernandes beers, indeed, I spent many hours drinking their fines wares when I lived in England, but this one was a disappointment. Just to thin and not enough hops."
"A: Straw yellow and very clear. 2 finger head rapidly dissipates.		S: very malty, sour aroma.		T: Bitter hops, corn and malts add to the sweetness. 		M: Light as it gets. Crisp, refreshing beer.		Overall: Light beers are why I thought I didn't like beer in my early drinking days. But I want to try as many as I can and light beers are still beers."
"bottle to pint.		A: Hazy amber, big off white head. Some lacing.		S: Malt, caramel, hints of flowers, tea leaves, dairy.		T: Malty start, followed by some floral notes, that quickly disolves to water. A funny bitter and soapy aftertaste.		M: Light body, light carbination.		O: Easy drinking but so is water. Everything about this beer seems diluted. at $1.99 for 22oz. I say I got what I paid for."
"A- Reddish brown with a fair amount of haze. Head was creamy white but retention was low.		S- Sourness with darker roasted malt smell with some malt sweetness. I got excited by how interesting this smelled, and then...		T- Much less appealing than the smell, it starts with citric sourness, sweet caramel malt and is overpowered by a burnt malt flavor. The sour/burnt mix is very unappealing and I struggled to find some highlight to this flavor combination (and couldn't).		Mouthfeel- even carbonation with unfortunately light mouthfeel.		Overall, I get the impression that there was just a little bit too much black patent in the brew, giving an oppressively bitter finish that lingered unpleasantly long after every taste. Perhaps with more mid-level caramel malt and less burnt barley husks this would be a more pleasant beer."
I know this is a classic but this was a bit of a wallflower beer for me, so mild and straightforward that I almost didn't notice it. Green bottle to glass, golden color, slight skunky smell. Taste was clean and refreshing, pretty good level of carbonation, there was a nice hop/bitter finish. This really doesn't have anything compelling in it for me to get again, but I'm fairly new at this. Might revisit in a while to see if I can find the finer nuances and complexities.
"Enjoyed on 01-24-09 at Anacapa. It was a sunny Saturday afternoon with my girlfriend.		A: Typical American Wheat. Nothing notable.		S: Not much too it. Maybe a bit of citrus.		T: Since it was served on the warmer side of cool (Stout temp, instead of the appropriately cooler temp), it was hard to get passed that part. No lemon offered (not that it's a bad thing)		M: Only drank it quickly so I could move on to another selection.		D: Not very exciting.		Don't get me wrong by this review. Anacapa rocks! Most of their brews are outstanding! Try the Espresso Stout that's there right now!		Hopefully they'll bring the C Street Wheat back to the drawing board."
"I had this on tap at the brewery on 10/17/09		16oz. pour into one of founders standard imperial type glasses. The server described this beer as a chocolate, oatmeal porter brewed with habenero pepper. Pours jet black with a standard 1 1/2 inch head that's pretty common for a nitro pour. The first smell that hits my nose is that of sweet chocolate and roasted grain, there are also notes of sweet malt. Knowing that this was a ""pepper beer"" I would have never guessed it from the smell as the smell of the peppers seems to be completely masks by the chocolate, oats and grains in the beer. The taste was a different story completely. Original taste of milk and sweet chocolate followed quickly by an intense rush of peppery spiciness....WOW. The spice sits in your throat for several minutes after each sip. This is a very unique beer, but not at all something I would order again....way to much spice for me. That being said I have to give a lot of props to the brewers at Founders because what they have achieved here is basically turning a spicey rich mole into a beer. It's pretty phenomenal when a brewer attempt to put a flavor into a beer that is not the norm and hits it dead on. Bravo to Founders for making one supremely spicey ale!"
"Thanks to jcwattsrugger for bringing this back from his trip to South America.		Pours brownish orange with a thin white lasting head.		The smell is of caramel and rock candy. Some roasty notes. There is something mixed in the aroma that reminds me of cheap scotch.		The taste is of caramel and candy sweetness - grainy malt - a bit boozy. The image of cheap scotch continues. Buttery diacetyl is there, but mild enough. There is a vague sour fruitiness as it progresses. Sweet, caramelish finish.		The feel is thinnish with mild carbonation.		Imbalanced - too sweet for me."
"12 oz. bottle tried 21 Mar 2009.		Poured in a Sierra Nevada pint. Medium sized head, off white. Medium carbonation. Slight haze, reddish brown. Smells almost like chocolate cake with cherry overtones, sweet. Starts lightly chocolatey, the cherry flavor is upfront. Cherry seems kind of one dimensional. Tart finish. Medium body. Minimal alcohol presence.		I normally like cherries and chocolate in beer but this didn't really do it for me."
"A: Very low on carbonation. Very small head with poor head retention. Thin film rests on the surface of the brew. Dark garnet red in color, looks very attractive when held to the light.		S: Low amounts of aroma. Sweet dried-fruit maltiness. The ethyl alcohol is also present.		T: Malty and spicy with little hops. Raisins, plums, and ethanol are the main contributors to flavor.		M: Medium bodied with a solvent-like mouthfeel. Very boozy.		D: I don't know know if this beer is for me. I love big beers, but this one is a tad unbalanced."
"Bottle poured into a snifter. I was excited to try this one and vastly disappointed by the results. 		A - dark as night as one would expect, but even a rough pour left a small, short-lived head.		S - bourbon, coffee (but not good coffee, we're talking bad gas station coffee here)		T - bourbon, bourbon, bourbon, and more bourbon, coffee, a little chocolate, and roasted malt. I couldn't enjoy the chocolate maltiness because the bourbon flavor was so overpowering. In spite of all that bourbon taste, I do give it credit for concealing its 11.2% ABV pretty well.		M - nice medium body, probably this beers best feature.		D - glad I tried it once. Left me never wanting another."
Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip. The color is a very dark brown bordering on black with a very thin layer of head. The smell has lots of hops. I'm getting plenty of pine and citrus. A sweet aroma from the malt is also clearly present. Some vanilla and alcohol make it through as well. Nice and complex aroma. The taste is big. Lots of hops and lots of malt. A sharp hop bitterness started it off for me leading to a sweet caramel malt flavor and finishing it up with a rather harsh alcohol flavor. The alcohol warmth grew as the beer warmed and was pretty distracting in the taste. I tend to dislike the typical sweet barley wine, but this seems to be closer to a DIPA is the bitterness to sweetness ratio which is a plus. The hop profile doesn't really do it for me and the alcohol kick isn't too enticing. The mouthfeel is full and viscous with low carbonation. I find the drinkability to be pretty low. One 12 ounce bottle will be a bit much fo me. This was pretty nice to try since it's a big and complex beer, but it's not something I would seek out again.
An odd one, I like cherry and I bought it at the brewery where the scoop was that it would not be syrupy sweet. It wasn't. No head Reddish colour, dry bitterness with cherry in there all right, on the medicinal side. Almost no carbonation. Ohio gathering.Interesting aroma, with alcohol present.
"poured a deep brown/red, pretty hazy, with a hop-fueled off-white head. sticky looking and retentive.		smell is pine bomb as sticky and resinous chemicals assault the nose. much like a humid day where you can feel the moisture on your skin, you can physically feel chemicals coming off.		taste is citric acid bitter, floral, and piney all combined into a tongue sticking mess. the palate is wrecked immediately with the overly sticky substance of the brew.		see above for mouthfeel."
"Recently I've been back on the IPA, IIPA kick and, having just had the Abrasive, a kickass DIPA in a 16oz can, I figured my local beer store owner would love to try it. So she traded me a Ballz Deep 16oz can, a beer they would soon be carrying. New Double IPA from the Pac-NW. Beautiful. I was hoping that perhaps this would be the double that sets a new standard for the Pac-NW. As it is, the elusive Boundary Bay Double is what it is. So I eagerly awaited ripping open the can..		Poured a sexy looking light orange, looked fantastic, but, to my severe disappointment, no hop aroma erupting from my glass. It's there, sure. But you have to seek it out. A little bit of pine, smaller amount of grapefruit and grassiness. Malt notes overrun this beer. A bit dextrinous, caramel, well-balanced, but not a standard bearer. Not what I was looking for with a new NW DIPA. A bit sticky. 		Somebody got the better end of that deal..not us."
"12oz poured into a tall tulip glass		A: One finger of thick white head atop an amber beer - quite dark for a DIPA. Retention and lacing are quite nice.		S: All hops. Almost indiscernible hop bitterness - maybe a bit of tropical fruit. A bit odd. I can get some sweetness as it warms.		T: Like drinking alcoholic hop extract. This is really, really bitter. It completely dries my mouth out. This is far, far too hoppy. I get toffee sweetness as it warms. I've certainly had worse, but this is not very good. The flavor I do get is a bit odd.		M: A bit thick for the style, but not bad.		O: This beer is too hoppy. I can't imagine anyone thinking this is appropriately hopped. It lingers in your mouth for a long time. The hop flavor it does have is not very good."
16.9oz bottle with Monty Python inspired label. Poured a medium amber with good amount of head and carbonation. Head had good retention and good lacing. The smell was above average. The taste however was disappointing. I'll admit that this is not my normal sytle of beer but even so it was lackluster. After looking at the other reviews, maybe I had a bad bottle but since I got it from Whole Foods which is normally top notch I doubt it. Worth a try once but not twice. PR 2.0 LMH.
"A: A dark amber in color with a nice thick white head. Nice lacing all the way through as well.	S: Hello alcohol! Bourbon, bourbon, and more bourbon. It's hard to distinguish other aromas when the bourbon is so strong, though I can faintly smell vanilla.	T: A strong bourbon and heavy alcohol punch up front. Harsh! As the fire subsides oak and vanilla flavors are present.	M: Thin...	D: Let me put it this way, I won't be seeking this beer out again.		However...I think the bottle I had was way too young. The alcohol has not settled and melded. It seems to have some good underlying characteristics that may present themselves better in a years time once the alcohol settles down."
"A- darker than I expected, a rusty copper with an very light tan head. Decent head, appears to be leaving some lacing as well.		S- Aroma seems to be floral hops with some slight mustiness as well.		T- Initial taste is almost caramel/brown sugar, biscuit-like. Not what I was expecting, but not altogether bad. This fades quickly and a more typical pine resin taste takes over. A bit of the mustiness present in the taste as well, especially as it warms just a bit. No notable floral/citrus in the taste.		M- Fine carbonation, aftertaste lingers, medium bodied.		D- It's drinkable, personally I'd opt for other DIPAs. It's almost like this beer is backwards with an initial maltiness that finishes with a lot of hops."
12 oz bottle. It pours a moderate golden color with a 2-finger ivory head of large bubbles that falls fairly fast to a finger over top. Clarity is good, and there is a steady and strong carbonation in the beer. The aroma is butterscotch, fruity eter, and caramel sweetness from the malt, The butter is dominant in this one and I'm not finding any real hop presence. The flavor is again dominated with butterscotch and caramel sweetness, with a mild bitterness that comes through despite a clear lack of real hop flavor. Moutfeel is on the thin side of moderate with a solid moderate carbonation in there as well. I find the ringwood yeast in this one detracts from the beer by dominating it with buter and butterscotch in both flavor and aroma. I would not have this one again for that reason.
"Ultra pale-yellow hue, translucent, tiny soapy white head, little retention, few specks of lace. Cooked-veggie (DMS) nose, hints of skunk borderline awful. The palate is pathetic grainy, husky, skunky, somewhat sweet, weak bitterness. The malt saves the taste (from being awful) and provides enough substance for a respectable mouthfeel, decent carbonation. Slightly sweet finish, empty. Amstel Light possess few redeeming qualities. This is lower tier, even for a light beer, not recommend for human consumption. 		My first Amstel Light will also be my last."
"A: Love the semitransparent amber color and the lacing; hard not to score this a 5.0 on appearance		S: Obvious floral aroma reminiscent of hibiscus; some citrus notes present as well		T: Fairly strong flavor for a pale ale; first sip is good with the citrus coming through on the front palate followed by a sugary fruitiness; back palate has a very pronounced grapefruit-hop bitterness, even for a pale ale; it is worth noting that after a couple of sips the front/mid palates all but disappear shooting straight to the typical bitter pale ale finish		M: Acidity and carbonation come to mind, not bad; medium body becoming instantly foamy in mouth		D: Average smoothness for a pale ale, but I can't escape the thought that one beer is more than enough		Strengths: 	Nearly flawless appearance in glass. Nice persistent hoppy bitterness on back palate.		Weaknesses: 	Despite the strong initial flavor, midway through a glass this beer becomes one-dimensional; after one of these, I'm ready to move on to something else		Okay beer if you are faced with limited options, but better pale ales are readily available in stores"
"On tap at the Jupiter brewpub in downtown Berkeley. 		A: Pours a hazy, dark amber with small off-white head; moderate retention, not much in the way of lacing. The retention may be excused by the fact that a server brought it over with several other drinks for the table. I'm guessing they tweaked the recipe since the earlier reviews, since this seems darker. 		S: Whoo. Like sniffing pine needles. There is a small citrus note in there, but it's pretty much like sticking your nose up an evergreen's ass. Caramel too. Nothing all that complex for a DIPA. 		T: Taste-wise, not particularly complex either. Lots of pine, as noted earlier, and there are hints of citrus in there. The bitterness is well balanced with spice, earth, and caramel in the finish. But the aftertaste is resiny. 		M: Medium-bodied; slightly syrupy. Moderate carbonation and a noticeable, but not awful, booze warmth. 		D: A pretty solid go-to DIPA, but nothing outstanding. I'm glad they have this because it means I'll have something to enjoy the next time I'm there, but it's not worth a trip just for this."
This stuff should have a vintage on it. 12 oz bottle, rather unassuming. Typical Stoudt's, right? Wrong. This is one assertive brew. This deep amber colored beer with gold highlights sports a rather creamy head. The aroma is heavy with caramel notes. Some hops , but mostly caramel and alcohol esters. The first sip produces a heavy alcohol burn, backed by a mild bitterness and then a heavy dose of that caramel flavor. Higher alcohols on the finish. A nice experience, but not an everyday or even a regular drinking beer. Buy a few and lay em down for a while, maybe they'll improve.
"My first Founders - very excited that it's Breakfast Stout. This stuff pours black - it doesn't let any light shine through it either. A hard pour produced about 1/4"" light brown head that fades fairly quickly. Some light wispy lacing remains. 		It smells great - lots of roasted malt, coffee (with vanilla creamer added) and a caramelized brown sugar note. 		The taste is a pretty big let down from the smell and appearance. Lots of bitterness - the detracting upfront kind that doesn't allow much flavor through. The bitterness hangs around on the finish too along with a hit of C2H5OH. 		The beer does redeem itself with a thick, rich mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. 		The bitterness keeps its drinkability down - I am not looking forward to my next sip - a bad sign for any beer. 		Maybe this beer does need aging - I am not impressed at this point. I will revisit in a month or two."
"I had this while on vacation during my 'Reading Week' or what some would consider Spring break...I had this on my way to Disney World...I would say its alright...the alcohol...well, let's say, how could you even tell there was any?		It was a pale golden colouration, with minimal lacing around the rim, mostly around the rim, some to the edge of the glass. Definitely too sweet for my scent, almost pure honey-ish in scent.		Though, again, it was very light, even with what I would consider a 'perfect' carbonation, seems like a forced carbonation ( I can pretty much guarantee a forced carbonation method). But with the taste, I would like you to refer to the overall aroma.		I prefer a higher alcohol beer, I'm not completely sure whether this is even within the range of 5%ABV...more like 3-3.5% at MOST! But those who prefer a lower ABV beverage, here's your brew. Again the drinkability, I prefer higher alcohol, this is very easy to drink with the LOW content."
"The appearance and mouthfeel are both good. The beer is jet black, with a small brown head that doesn't linger. The mouthfeel is rich and chewy. However, the aroma and flavor are so overpoweringly of coffee grounds that I did not enjoy this beer at all. I do like coffee, strong coffee with cream and sugar. However, I don't like those chocolate covered coffee beans that coffee shops sometimes sell. This beer is like the coffee beans. It smells and tastes exactly like coffee grounds, but unfortunately, not like brewed coffee. While there is some toffee malt flavor beneath the coffee flavor, both the taste and aroma are dominated by the coffee, creating a one-dimensional beer that completely lacks subtlety. I couldn't enjoy this as is, so I mixed it (eeek! beer blasphemy) with a mild, homebrewed milk stout and enjoyed it much more than straight up. IMHO, this is an example of American craft breweries' tendency to adhere to the maxim ""why do when you can overdo?""."
Pours with a four-finger white head that fades quickly to a ring but leaves a good lace. Clear pale amber color. Light=medium bodied and light carbonation. Slightly sweet nose. Taste has hints of an American macro but it is better - not skunky, still nothing special. Gift - 12oz bottle is available at the Vintage Cellar Blackburg, Va.
"When at a wedding, most times your beer options are limited...once the Heinekens ran out, had to switch to Amstel Light. 		A: Pours a bright golden color with some heightened amber hues on the outside. Provides a small white foam head that dissipates to nothing.		S: Some oh so small amounts of bread, but mostly corn and some sort of metallic scent.		T: Similar to the smell but there seemed to be a little more bready malt character. The taste remains constant throughout, slightly malty and thin.		M: A light bodied lager that is a watery. Not much happening on the palate.		O: Not a beer I would purchase or necessarily reach for but it did the job over the other available options that night. Could still do worse than an Amstel Light."
This was quite an experience. I had read the good reviews and was looking forward to the hops fix. The appearance was a dark hazed amber with a big frothy off-white head and great lacing throughout. The aroma was similarly spectacular with sweet piney hops and mellow malt with a touch of raison on the edges. The taste immediately hit me as alcohol and that's where I started to lose my affection a bit. Although I have had many stronger ales than this 10% offering, this one instantly detracted from the flavor in my mind. It had a nice creamy feel with buttery malt and more of the raison touch, leaving a sort of licorice taste in the back of my mouth. This is strong stuff but it does seem to mellow a bit as your taste buds adjust and that's where I finally picked up some tastey hops, but it was a mild suggestion and not entirely up to my standards for an IPA. I guess I should avoid the double IPA's but I have had others that seem a little less overdone. Still, this is clearly a quality effort and recommended for a try. I would drink it again but I would prefer to drink this slowly with a hunk of cheese at my side.
"12oz. bottle thanks to nflmvp		Pours a very hazy reddish-brown with a mountainous tan head that breaks the plane of the glass, but eventually thins. Thick, sticky lacing on the glass. Some thick brown yeast floating on top of the head. Contaminated?		Smell is funky yeast. I suspect that this bottle has been compromised.		Taste is all funky yeast with a very sour hop flavor. Definite contamination.		Very disappointed that my first experience of this beer was a contaminated bottle. It has definitely been plagued by the grand funk of death."
Ordinary lager in yellowish appearance and in taste, no aroma. Lace in glass. Suspicion of a hop in there. A faint notice of citrus. Light mouthfeel. Unbelievably modelled after Corona, a high bear to jump over. And they did it! On-tap at the brewpub.
"Quote from my fiancee: ""Does 'crappy' have one or 2 p's?"" That says it all. I think I had a bottle that was exposed to the light too long because the skunk smell was literally unbearable. Whatever positives in the flavor were drowned out by the horrid stench. I will have to try this one again sometime..."
"Picked this up at a Spanish import shop in Guatemala City.		Appearance	Light orange, though a bit more color than most macro lagers; clear; nice, frothy white head; minimal carbonation; head dissipates quickly		Aroma	Faint yeast and malt, a hint of hops; mostly sulphury and uninviting (possible oxidation?)		Taste & Mouth Feel	Skunky and sour malt bitterness; immediately reminds me of malt liquor; leaves a metallic and salty aftertaste that hangs around too long; creamy texture and more substantial than your typical macrolight-to-medium body; fine level of carbonation		Overall 	This is not enjoyable to me; in fact, I don't even want to finish it. It has more flavor than most macros, but unfortunately that flavor is not good. It falls short of the pilsener style in every way except its color. Its texture is probably its best attribute, but overall it's not good. I wouldn't drink this again nor would I recommend it."
"This brews appearance is black with reddish / amber hues around the sides of my goblet. The head is a nice tan color but is small and fleeting. The head quickly reduces itself to a thin ring with an island in the middle.		The aroma is a bit bready with hints of roasted malt with a smidgen of alcohol in the nose.		Its alcohol content is quite noticeable and provides the throat with a minor burn. The flavor is a bit roasty but is dominated by alcohol and dextrose sweetness. This beer is a bit much for my taste buds.		The brews mouth feel is medium bodied and a bit oily.		Drinkability is definitely hindered by the ABV which makes this one a sipping beer for certain. Its good for those who like the sweet ones with a bit of a burn, but not one that I would recommend. 		I will leave this one to the heavyweights."
"The first clue to the off nature of this brew was the lack of any head (after the first 10 seconds). 		The clincher though was the faint hint of LePage's Glue (like we used in grade school in the 1950's) that came through as it rested on my tongue. 		I hate to be unkind, but this beer - at least the bomber I bought - is dissapointing at best (in fact I drain poured about 16 of the 22 oz.)		It's sort of a sour, off-tasting funky mess without being enjoyably hop-bitter."
Filtered down watery american-pilsener style lager, tastes just like Budweiser (which I believe has a share in the brewery, go figure) not that much of a head, not many hops to speak of, smooth enough, other than that its from Aruba this is fairly normal. Fairly boring too.
"It is quite a happy day indeed; Terminal Gravity Brewing (of Enterprise Oregon) has finally got a bottling line. There are many (myself included) that think that TG makes the finest IPA in the state of Oregon. I am now happy to spread the TG word to the rest of the US. Sure there are more bitter beers and there are stronger IPAs out there but none seems to bring it all together quite as well as TG. 			YUUUMMM, You all know what I'm talking about. That hazy copper orange color, tight but not overly large head, floral citrus hop aroma and that light malty / fruity flavor that quickly gets overwhelmed by the wonderfully aggressive hop bitterness.			If youre a hophead I suggest buying more than one bottle. If you only get one you will be heart broken that you have to wait another shipping cycle for more."
"A - Dark yellow in color. Carbonation looks high.		S - The nose is light, with hints of corn and other cheap grains. Has a bit of skunk smell in the background. The nose ends grainy and skunky.		T - There is a slight presence of hops. Maybe not.		M - Highly carbonated. Feels bubbly on the tongue.		D - . Don't think I couldnt drink more than a 24oz of this stuff. Would only drink this if my options were terrible or if I was given some free at a party. :)"
Pours a deep reddish brown color with a thick unrelenting yellowish white head with a ton of lacing. Smells of hops and rye. Tastes of piny hops, rye, and a little caramel malt in there. Bitterness is just right. Mouthfeel is medium with a good carbonation. Drinkability is medium as well. Best Founder's beer to date.
"Bottle review, drank 2 days after Christmas. This is gonna be a bad review, my apologies up front to the good people of Hoppin Frog. But man was this beer a serious pile of spicy nastiness. It smelled like Old Spice deodorant and gingerbread cookies, shit-tons of cinnamon and, I guess, nutmeg. Ugh, it tastes just like it smells. This strays too far from the boundaries of good beer, it's really a spiced carbonated cookie-flavored pop. In no way will I ever get this again, this was an unnecessary addition to the Hopping Frog line-up. 		But hey, if you like spiced beers this might be for you."
"12oz bottle served in a pint glass.		pours a clear, straw yellow tone while yielding a short lived finger or so of a spritzy white head. no real retention or lacing to speak of. not atypical for the style.		very muted nose is mainly grain, corn, and *maybe* a slight touch of hops hiding in the background. not impressed.		taste is not very good. not because it's repulsive, but more because there is nothing to taste; somehow even more muted than the aroma. light corn and grain element. thin bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation.		overall, nothing i will waste my time with again. its only real selling point is that it's relatively inoffensive. unless you're offended by bland, flavorless beers."
"My last blind beer! How will I survive April!?!? Woe is me... Flute or pilsner glass. Why not both?! I'll see how each one treats and go with my favored glass. 		The corked and caged bottle is a BITCH to open. It rips my thumbs and was a hell of a problem to unscrew. Reminds me of the Upland Blueberry I opened a while back.		A- Ended up liking the pilsner glass a ton more. Gives off a giant puffy lacing that is occlusive of 75% of the glass with insane retention and stickiness. The coloration of the mass that never truly leaves is dried coffee stains on a cotton white dress shirt. This sits above the soy sauce coca-cola mixture... not cloudy. Unusual.		S- Strong funky brown sugar coming through first. It has a background toasted funk going to it, a crystallized burnt sugar hint. Its a bit more muddy brown sugar than any other type of sweetness. A sharpness is on the backend... something acidic and fibrous. Can't pin it down, but its nothing negative so no complaints.		T- Nothing too complex or crazy. Opens up sweet and minorly bitter. The sweetness is principally what you expect from the nose. Burnt sugars and earthen brown sugars. Tad bit of chocolate, very minute amount. Middle has a rising of the bitterness as the sweetness saturates its location and fades to the back. Truly an interesting bitterness to it. Not necessarily burnt grain style or coffee bitterness, but some type of hops I don't taste too often. Good amount of hops, even. Can't place it. Its short lived and gives a very clean finish. Paper clean... school paper, not newspaper. Classy, college-ruled even.		As it warms up, the middle is more ethanolic than bitter. Really starts to hurt the flavors and cause problems for my enjoyment to it.		M- Full bodied, very crisp and carbonated. The alcohol is not excessively hot, but so imbalanced to the flavors and body it detracts hugely from the enjoyment. My mouth cries in pain at times. Not as sticky as I would have liked it.		D- Not the greatest beer. Actually, I would put it at less than awesome. It rolls around like a bit above average beer at times, but for the most part it starts to separate out and can't bring itself back together into a delicious mass once again. Watch this be low alcohol and it drinks like I feel a 10% might with the amount of burn, flavor, and annoyance."
I believe this is the retired Elora Irish Ale brewed by the Old Mill. However, it had the Trafalgar lighthouse cap on it, so I'm unsure if this beer or the Old Mill has been bought out. Seeing as the Old Mill Elora ale is retired, I'll post my review here. Comes out a ruby/blood red with a very small amount of foam. Smells very sweet. Plenty of fruits and berries, with some bready malts and toffee. Taste starts out with an overbearing sweetness. Dark fruits, berries, caramel and toffee just overpowers the palate, making me wonder if it would be more tolerable if served cold. Ends a bit bitter, with some grassy and earthy hops, with a bit of coffee. Mouthfeel is light bodies and somewhat oily. Starts out too sweet for me to consider it drinkable. I may try it again at a colder temperature, but I believe that if a beer needs to be served ice cold, then it's probably not that good a beer. Overall, not to my liking. If you like sweets, though, give it a try.
"Im perplexed and dissatisfied by this brew. A big hitter on the BA site, but I was thoroughly disappointed by it - the main category, taste, was a major letdown. Just a hot and mediciney pine and grapefruit combination. The whole body was sharp and hot, but by mid-bottle the tongue is numbed a bit. A funky sour ale malt finish adds to the eww factor of this one.		Pour and citrus pine aromas was OK  but this is not one that Ill go back for."
"12 oz bottle poured into a standard flared pint glass		(Served in a pint glass)		A- Copper body with an off white creamy head that is seems to dissipate fairly quickly There is a fair carbonation and although the head is gone there is some lacing.		S- All citrus fruit hops come through with pine notes and all grapefruit finish.		T- Starts off clean and fresh but as it lingers I get an alcohol warming that is not desirable, as well as an after taste that is too much grapefruit and not enough malt. Definitely not a session beer for me.		M- Medium mouthfeel with a harsh alcohol warmth in the finish left me wanting another taste just to make sure.		O- Overall this one is on the border of the style for me and not well balanced. Some good depth and hops character but no support from the malt. It's alcohol finish with bitter grapefruit ending is not smooth or pleasant for my liking in this style."
"500 ml. bottle, blurb and coded lot/freshness date on the back label, sampled in a lager glass. On my bottle the ABV is listed as 9%.		Poured a dirty tarnish golden with a small white foamy head, better retention than I was expecting, settled into a thin creamy lacing.		Smells like a decently brewed malt liquor, cheap gin and vodka-like ethanol, touches of grain malts and old musty hops. 		Malt liquor type of boozy moderate bodied mouthfeel, also has a stale alcohol flatness to it. The alcohol is the king here, boozy ethanol that meshes with syrupy sweet pale malts, a sugar buzz. Used up, spent, musky hops become barely noticeable towards the end. Cheap malt liquor finish, dryish, sweet and laced with stale alcohol.		Well, I've tried it, so now in the future I can pass it by when I see it on the shelves."
"First had: ? (a random bar somewhere)		I'm just not a pils fan, and this is no champion among them. Pours a clear, yellow color, carbonated, with a quickly-dissipating white head. Weak grains and some grassy funk in the aroma. Weak, sweet, malts, grainy, with bitter hops that create a metallic sensation. Light bodied and not at all pleasurable to drink."
"Brewed by Harboe for the Danish/Swedish supermarket chain Netto. 		The colour is medium gold; the finger thick head is white and compact. It sinks down quickly leaving no lacing. 		The smell is very sweet with notes of sweeteners and honey, damp barley and some odd notes of pulp. Neither hops nor bitterness here.		Sweet, simple malt dominates the mild taste. Artificial sweeteners and honey flavours are blended with some minerals and chemical notes of wet paper. The aftertaste adds more of the sweet wet paper flavour. Luckily, it fades quickly.		The carbonation and the bubbles are all average for the style.		It would be easy to blame the low alcoholic content, but during the last week I have had several fine 3.5% beers. This is just a boring beer."
"No head, no lace ... generically copper IPA ... is my glass beer clean? Oh yes, I just downed a few and it sure was ...		Metallic hop leaf reigns supreme on the nose. Completely unenticing. Hints of cooked veggies and grain.		Strangely rye-like consistency to the malt, which should be a complement but isn't at all. Something unpleasant about the malt keeps me away from enjoyment of the only mediocre hop presence. 		Can't forgive the hop blasts when the malt tastes likes its dredged up from the Willamette river.		Meh."
"A: The appearance is beautiful. At one moment it is brown in the middle with ruby highlights. If you move it a little bit it can turn gold or red. There is plenty carbonation sticking to the glass, however the head is only a small tan pancake that shows up late at dies quickly.		S: The biggest smell is burnt sugars, but when it is really cold you can pick up on a very sweet fruit smells, I am guessing melons.		T: The taste is very heavy on the burnt sugars. Thankfully, the alcohol doesn't show itself with the typical burn, but with more of a minty burn. Everything is very forward. Other taste include bitter hops, some fruits like cherries and melons, and caramel.		M: The mouthfeel is great.		D: The beer is very bitter, so this brew is reduced to a sipper.		There is a weird chewy spot that collects on the top of the beer after a while. At first I thought one of my friends had spit into my beer, but I was glad too see the same thing in the second one because I drank the first one anyway.		It is overall a good session beer. It is also fairly easy to get drunk off of the well hidden 8.3% abv."
Never had a Spanish beer before. Bought it at a local package liquor store. Carton claims 5.5% alc. by volume. Pours clear, golden from bottle. I noticed a yeast residue in the bottom of the bottle. Good carbonation in the glass, but this extends to the mouth so it gave me the feel of champagne. All that carbonation should have resulted in good head formation, but there was hardly any with almost no lacing. I didn't find this appealing. Aroma is slightly skunky, grassy. More aroma than I would have thought. Contains maize in the recipe according to the bottle, so its a bit thin tasting. Slight hoppiness in the aftertaste.
"A: Poured from a bottle to a pilsener glass. Had an amber-red color and a cloudy texture. There was a decent amount of head and some OK lacing.		S: What I mainly picked up from the smell on this one is the alcohol, though some of the malt came through a little. Not very pleasant.		T: As with the smell, the alcohol pushes its way to the top. There's a hint of maltiness, but the alcohol is so oppressive it's kind of unbelievable.		M: A below average amount of carbonation and a slick finish. Medium-bodied.		D: I tried this one just for the experience of trying a Lithuanian beer. It seems to exist solely for the purpose of getting the drinker completely wasted, not for the enjoyment of drinking. It's not a nice beer to drink."
"Pours a light amber color with golden hues and a slight haze. The small off-white head lingers before falling to a thin sheet and leaves little lace. 		Full on floral hop aroma with lots of grass, an herbal character, and some tart citrus. Not much malt in the nose, just a hint of toasted grain & bread..		An absolute hop assault that is intense and strong but not overly bitter. Very floral and herbal with a big tea-like quality. Citrus shows up as well but the malt scarce. I was surprised the hops in this were too much for me since I've been into hoppy beers lately. I'm starting to realize I am not a fan of the flavor of Centennial hops. Way too floral for my liking and the alcohol peaks in a little too much.		Full bodied and nicely carbonated. Creamy but too thick in my opinion for an IPA. OK drinkability, higher if you're a Centennial fan, but too harsh for me."
"Ap. Black, opaque with a nice tan head.	Sm. Immediately hit with a sour milk smell...it might be me, but it just killed it right there. Also chocolate milk is very present with some hops in the background.	Ta. Chocolate milk and chocolate malt - mild with vague bitterness at the finish.	Mf. good, smooth, creamy.	Dr. I just can't get past the sour milk thing. It's probably me and my horrible experience with afternoon milk (not cold, gag, suck it down in 30 seconds and try not to GAG!) in 3rd grade (c.1959). So, enjoy! I do not drink milk to this day."
Pale and clear yellow color, middling head at best, laces in two incomplete rings. Some sulfur to the aroma, some of cream corn aspects, malt dominates. Mouthfeel is light, along with carbonation and an overall graininess, the malt impression is fairly impaired. Hopping is decent and the finish is crisp, better than the beginning. Some metallics in later sips. Weak upfront and a little strident at the close, I can't say its very good even for the category.
"Appearance- dark brown to black, light tan head quicly fades away, very dark no light		Smell- very strong coffee and espresso, so strong and unique	smell, some roasted malts, but mostly pure coffee more then anything else		Taste- im a blown away how strong the taste of burbon whiskey is, infact way stronger then i had been hoping or expecting when i had put off to save trying this, not well balanced nearly enough as it should have been, literally not literally hint o f burbon taste like im drinking straight burbon, way to much alcohol to call it purely enjoyable, way overated and not enjoyable, unbalanced too burbony not enough beer,		Mouthfeel- semi sweet and syrupy but nothing impressive, the body is actually very light believe it or not in a way		Drinkability- tastes way to strong of liqour, i hope my other kbs tastes way better aged big freaking let down a terrible beer as of now that tastes too much burbon to be called beer, could never drink more then even one of these overerated beers, in my opinion had much better stouts"
Contained in 0.5 liter brown bottle. Pours as a urine colored yellow with a minimal head which melts away to nothing. Aroma is sweet, almost floral, with a hint of adjuncts and hops. Taste is light and mildly sweet and hoppy. The light body is without merit and leaves little trace of anything. At a cost of $2.49 a bottle, I expected more but this brew does not deliver anything that would induce me to recommend it to others.
"Pours with copious amounts of creamy, tan head. Brilliant copper body that almost glows. A very appetizing appearance. 		Fresh, sweet and spicy on the nose. Immediately noticeable alcohol. Light scotch whisky presense. Fused with coriander, caramelized sugars, pine aromas and a sweet malt presence. Very powerful. 		A rush of malty flavors quickly subdued by a charcoal / woody presence. Spicy and tangy suggesting coriander and curry. Big peat, smoke and black licorice flavors in the finish dominated by a massive, almost overbearing barley flavor. Notes of sweet toffee and caramel round out the finish. Unforunately, there is a VERY long and pungent aftertaste that is loaded with a burned barley flavor and tons of smoke. Faint hop presence as it warms. 		Mouthfeel is a little heavy and not quite as creamy as I would expect from more of a Scottish Ale than a Scotch Ale. 		Drinkability is so-so. It was a unique example of the style but a little difficult to consume. 		I left disappointed since I am a big fan of this style. It is doubtful that I would purchase another."
Also known as the Long Iron Pilsner, with a bit of hop aroma. Noticeably bitter middle, well carbonated, and bit of bitterness at end. Popular here. They say its the best pils to be had in the city and I can accept that. Not quite satisfying, could be smoother .
Nasty yellowish color with a bubbly tan head. Looks to have a higher carbonation than average. Smells like alcohol and bad malt. The taste is badly bitter with some old cut grass in there. It has a syrupy yet heavily carbonated body. Perhaps drinkable if you are too drunk to taste anything.
"Seems black to me. Thin fluffy light brown head. Lace is adequate. Aroma is pretty thick. Muddy, burnt, roasty and slightly chocolatey. Kind of sludgey in the mouth. Muddy taste to it. Dark, bitter roast and bitter chocolate too. Smoke is not that noticeable....on the nose or palate. There's a lingering astringency that just doesn't fit. The mouthfeel is light and a little too carbonated. It has an airy, slightly fizzy feel to it that gives me too many burps. This comes nowhere near the air that Alaskan and Stone walk on with their smoked porters. 		Thanks MJR. This one deepens my appreciation for the truly great Smoked Porters."
"Pours golden yellow with a creamy head that seems to last and good lacing. I had this from a wine glass with the beer at cellar temp		Aroma of sour green apple, piney, citrusy hops with light spices, ginger, pine needles		Not a whole lot of balance in the flavour, this beer shows off the hops. Citrus ripe grapefruit and lemon rind with no real solid malt backbone for any depth of flavour. 		Hard to ignore how light bodied this beer is. Really quite watery"
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass.		A - Orange-Amber color, quite cloudy for a pale ale. Thin white head with good retention. Medium carbonation.		S - Strong citrusy hops come through strong. Sweetness as well, a very well balanced and clean smell.		T - Quite bitter, though not a whole lot of actual flavor comes through. Tastes watery and carries a lot of heat at the end, which is surprising for a 5% beer. I picked this up as a single and I wonder if it isn't past its prime.		M - Thin and watery, with a little bit of bubblyness on the back of the throat.		D - I did not finish this bottle. Like I said I have no idea the bottling date so this could have simply aged past its prime. Though the smell was good so who knows. Bottom line - do not take this review as gospel."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a mug		A_Dark tan head, rich and frothy; dissipates to a nice thin top. 100% opaque. Black body, nice looking. Some lacing		S_Earthy, grilled and smoked bacon. Very strong		T_Strong charcoal, applewood smoked bacon, mellow and balanced		M_Medium carbonation, not mouth coating		D_Flavor so strong that its hard to drink too many of these"
"12 oz bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada imperial pint. 5.4% ABV, 35 IBUs, Best before Jun 21, 2010 printed on the neck.		A - Completely clear golden amber with moderate carbonation going up to a off-white head. Three-fingers tall with solid retention and patchy lace coating most of the glass.		S - Faint aroma in general that has the majority of the nose coming from lightly citrusy and floral hops. A drop of lemon livens what's there up. A background of pale malts isn't all too supportive.		T - A protein-tannin thing seems to overshadow what little flavor is there. Lemony citrus hop and an herbal touch. Low malt presence. It gets really metallic on the finish.		M - Medium-light bodied with a really dry metallic finish that kills the good hop bitterness at the start.		D - Blah. I can finish it but the metallic flavor and feel gets worse sip by sip. Not something I'd like to have again. Giving the last half to my brother."
B'ah. Bad beer. Pours a fuzzy yellow. Sort of cloudy. Very little head, about a finger, which diminishes to nothing. Smell is off. Grass, bready malts, and a rather odd sour aroma. It's like skunk, but it isn't. Taste seems metallic. Like a few iron nails are added in each bottle and allowed to corrode for a few weeks. Same odd skunk but not skunk sensation is in the taste as well. What is this? Overall, a bad beer. Not alot of redeeming qualities, unless you believe cold serving is a redeeming quality.
"Pours pitch black like the night sky of the countryside of Kentucky. about a fingers worth of chocolate colored head resulted from a moderately aggressive pour, doesn't last too long. No light can be seen through the body of this beer whatsoever.		i can smell strong boozy notes up front and immediately upon putting my nose to the glass. scents of vanilla/licorice, some dark chocolate, sweet rich malt. Very enjoyable nose.		The alcohol is very strong in the taste as well. Big bourgon flavors, lots of oakiness. Not tasting any kind of coffee, a hint of chocolate in the back, though. The booze really dominates everything else, its a bit overpowering.		Full bodied, but maybe not quite as thick as I had imagined it, which is a bit of a disappointment. I'm definitely getting a warming sensation in the back of my throat, which is always good on a cold night.		I can't get this in Oklahoma, and at 11.2%, i don't think i would want to drink very often if i could. This is definitely an interesting beer to try, but probably not one i would want to drink again and again. Thank you Beerwolf for the opportunity to try this beer."
"Tasted On-Tap 10/01/05 at the CBC in Cambridge, MA.		Mahogany in color with a light beige ringed head. Unfortunately everything goes downhill after the appearance... a buttery diacetyl aroma and flavor dominates over everything else. Light-medium bodied.		One was too many and this is the one to skip at CBC -- at least the Heather Ale was interesting.... This tastes nothing like described on their website. Bummer.		Per CBC website:	OG: 1.048 FG: 1.012 ABV: 4.7%"
"Chilled bottle into a glass. An extra courtesy of busch03 (and a second from onix1agr). Thanks guys! 		A: Pours a murky chestnut-amber body with no head whatsoever. A smattering of bubbles and a light collar around the brew. No lacing to speak of. Kind of disappointing , but I have had this experience with Founders a number of times... 		S: Leans toward the sweet, malty side with a dark raisin and cherry character. Some molasses, toffee, slight wood, and booze. 		T: Sweet caramel malt with a thick raisin, maple syrup, and molasses flavor behind it. Progresses into a slightly nutty toffee character with some wood and cherries. The finish is brown sugar with booze. It could use some balance. It began to get very syrupy and cloying after a while. 		M: Full-bodied, with low carbonation that brings out the flavor -- good for the style. Alcohol is apparent in the taste and has a warming effect on the way down. 		D: Tastes like diabetes. Disgustingly sweet, and a drain pour about halfway through -- and this is from someone who is generally to cheap to waste beer. Yecch."
"Minimum head, nice amber color but as expected the hops are in your face - the brewer says ""a hop lover's delight"".  I had to try it anyway just to see how bad (good?) the hops are.  The malts are hidden."
"Served in a shaker pint glass at Finn McCool's.		Another Quizzo beer entry. It ours a clear pale straw topped by about a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises soap, flowers, and corn syrup. Normally, these macro-ish types don't smell so goofy, but, frankly, as they smell bad, it's hard to really say this is entirely unusual. The taste follows closely, though some funky wheat slithers its way in there as well. Coulda done without that. The body is light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a sad beer, one I would definitely never call a damn good beer (even with spelling errors intact)."
"A- Hazey golden amber honey body with small white head that left no lacing.		A- Sweet malt and slight orange notes. I smell no corriander.		T- Sweet wheat malt and orange. Leaves an aftertaste similar to other Wits, but darker(?) tasting.		M- Medium light body with moderate carbonation.		D- No thanks. I wouldn't buy this beer. I might drink this beer if it was a hot day and I needed something refreshing, but I wouldn't count on it."
"The beer was served chilled and in a pint glass. 		Appearance: The body of the beer looks like coke in a glass. The head of the beer is a pillowy tan coloration. Nice head retention. Too bad the beer looks like coke. 		Smell: The aroma of lightly roasted malt very slight cocoa and almost coffee roast. Not terrible but in no way a robust porter.		Taste: Lightly roasted slightly toasted cocoa flavors. Again this isnt robust in the least. No offensive flavors just not brewed to my liking.		Mouthfeel / Overall: The body of the beer is thin. The carbonation is adequate. This beer is not offensive it is just not brewed to my taste. I would skip this one and grab a different porter."
I actually found a sixer of this at a store less than a month ago. I don't know when Founder's stopped production but this is still out there. It was on sale so I thought what the hell and got it. Well, this beer has gone bad. Sour notes and skunk and all. Just wanted to write to people not to get it. It actually begins decent but grows sour and sickening towards the finish. I really hope the Founder's guys make another lager-type beer and bottle it sometime in the future.
Very dark and dank mahogany in color but I had to pour pretty hard to get a good head. No audible hiss when I opened the bottle. Hopefully not undercarbonated. Smell is piney, earthy, woody, resiny, caramel, tropical notes and bitter. Has the smell of a barleywine. A little underwhelming compared to a fresh Bigfoot though. Very harsh bitterness. Kind of a very faint sweet maltiness backing it up. I am not really getting anything else other than harsh bitterness. There really isn't any flavor backing it up. And yes it is a bit undercarbonated. Not much heat thought which is a plus. Overall I think I am going to have to pour this out and get something I actually want to drink right now. This isn't doing it for me.
This poured a dark and clear tan with fluffy white head. It had an interesting smell like smoky malt and oak. It tasted even more interesting like hickory smoked ham or bacon, with salty roasted malt flavors. It was slightly thick with some carbonation and a smooth yet strong smoky aftertaste. Overall this was extremely unique, like drinking a black bean and ham soup with a porter base. Weird.
Good head, good lace and very dark ruby color.  Very good body but what was unexpected was the high hops in this porter.  I think of a porter as a equal mix of malt and hops but this was totally different.
Thanks again to the Market of Choice for stocking this beer. It's a very dark brown color that could almost be black. There is a nice aroma of oats. I wasn't too fond of the taste. It seemed somewhat bitter, but it also may have been from a bad batch as well. I probably wouldn't try this beer again, but I would like to try other Seven Brides beers.
"Appearance: Pours a pitch black color with a huge head - too much, in fact, though the retention is good; not much lacing, surprisingly		Smell: Dark chocolate, rather sweet, with a hint of coffee		Taste: Sweet, dark chocolate, up front; the same in the middle and in the finish; obviously, not much complexity		Mouthfeel: A real problem here, as the medium body is overwhelmed by fizzy carbonation, that prickles the tastebuds		Drinkability: The mouthfeel mars what would otherwise be a decent, though not complex, stout"
"Tasted by a pint at the John Russell Fox, a JDW pub in Andover, served by a non-sparkler pour.		A: light golden in colour, the fluffy white head settles to a thin foam and rests on top of mild carbonation.	S: upfront is a sharp aroma of crystal sugar, nectar, honey, with a touch of stinky hay, while the sticky malt-candy comes a bit OTT. Off-balance and too sweet. I wonder if the ale is ""semi-tired"" from a not-so-fresh cask, so that only the sweet edge of the aroma sustains?	T: biscuity malts and crystal sugar upfront are followed by a sour-sweet, pear-ish & citric fruitiness, as well as grassy hints of Czech hops... slightly thin in the aftertaste and very little bitterness manages to sustain. Little by little, the flavour also vanishes...	M&D: mildly fizzy at first, giving a good sign of freshness, but sip by sip the texture turns increasingly flat and static in the end... given this disappointing texture on top of the overly sweet and sour taste, this ale fails to be a pleasant one.		* Tasting Date: 26/05/06	Tasted by half-pint at the Penderel's Oak, a JDW pub nr. Holborn tube station, Central London during Wetherspoon's beer festival 11-21/05/06.	3.5 A: pours a pale amber hue, coming with little beer head and a low carbonated body. Served slightly warmer than ideal temp.	4 S: what an aroma... water-melon on skins(!), plus flowery sweet hops and sweet green pears... quite fragrant and different, although it smacks of more artificial fragrance than the natural stuffs; quite hoppy overall, while a faintly caramely+honeyish maltiness crouches deeply underneath. Attractive! (the festival leaflet mentions that Nugget and WGV hops are used--it might be the work of these unusual hops?)	3 T: medium-ripe fruity palate (pears+melons) and semi-sweet nutty maltiness upfront, backed by a spicy hoppy aftertaste with a rather short finish. Not bad, but way too thin and simplistic as opposed to the pleasant nose...	2.5 M&3 D: thin-ish bodied, pretty smooth on the mouthfeel due to lack of fizziness--overall it's a bit stale and not on form, though I'm surprised to find that the aroma could still be this pronounced. Must be much better and more complex when served fresher; I look forward to trying it again."
"Straw coloured with a two finger sized, foamy white head that lasts a lot better than expected & leaves a little lacing around the glass.		Rather light on the nose & as expected quite typical of the style; mainly grain & a bread/dough like aroma with possibly some corn too .		Pretty clean & chemical like. Leaves a skunky, unpleasant aftertaste that it count have done without although it is crisp	.	Not the smoothest beer but still okay on the palate which is expected as it it very light bodied bordering on watery.		Better than a few of the mass produced lagers out there but also trailing quite a few more.		http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
Dont much care for this at this time. Good aroma and appearance, but the flavor is laking in the like-ability. smells sweet and boozy with a hint of model glue on the finish. Nice golden color and light, slightly fizzy carbonation. Sweet, cheep scotch, ( with a drip of water) aroma with hint of froggy maple dominates the balate, with an unpleasant tannic bitterness on the finish. I drank this trying to find something good, as it is the only Founders beer I have wanted to pour out. This bruiser will go the test of time, but will still be a bruiser in the least.
Poured from a bottle and wow, so much popping from all of the carbonation. Way too much for the style IMO and I haven't even tasted it yet. Smell is of weak coffee and roasts. No bourbon. Taste has much less body than I want for a stout. THERE'S the carbonation. So much, too much. Still no hint of bourbon. I taste mild malt. Taste kind of watered down with a mild coffee finish. If you are curious to try this, I would recommend buying a single bottle before buying the 4 pack, if possible.
"Pours okay for a light tan head, which dissipates quickly, and the body is pitch black in color.		In the aroma there are coffee, cocoa, and bourbon characteristics.		Taste wise it is very metallic... Almost like sucking on pennies. The coffee/cocoa taste is mildly detectable. 		MF is thin, even though this has a higher abv. You can tell this does have a bit more strength in the end with a warming feeling.		Okay I'm new to these barrel aged beers and what not, but the bourbon does not mesh well in this brew and the aging process probably took what was once a decent stout, and turned it into a heap of a mess."
"Sparkingly clear deep ruby red, forming a creamy light tan head with very good retention and average lacing. Carbonation is moderate. Very nice looking beer. The aroma is a pleasant mix of English and American hop varieties all balanced by a slight hint of caramel, green apple esters, sweet wet grain husk, and residual sugars. Mouthfeel is smooth and satisfying with a medium body. The taste is a recap of the above. The hops are herbaceous and I detect some musty cardboard in the middle with faint alcohols and mild fusels in the middle. The finish is very earthy and dirty and has an oxidized aftertaste.		This looks and smells nice, but it doesn't hold up in the flavor department. Ruddy and bland, it's not something I would care to have again. A less than average ESB, like something Miller/AB would have came up with."
Reviewed 11/16/2008 (Tap @ The Stable, St. Louis, MO): Pours a dark black body, with a creamy brown head that is lasting. Okay lacing. Chocolately, coffee aroma, roasted, but not very strong. Watery taste. Bitter, with a dark chocolate aftertaste. Better coffee taste as it warms up, not as bitter. Somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Some alcohol hotness as it really warms up. Not my thing.
"Clear amber, decent lace. Nothing special.		Nose has an intriguing oak waft, like fresh oak, with a slight bit of bourbon. Not sure where the actual beer is.		The Oak hits hard up front, with the bourbon to follow, but they linger because the actual beer does not hold up - the storage tastes dominate, and leave this taste very unbalanced, some hops noticiable at the end with slight malt, but malt looses the battle here.		Mouthfeel is good with heaviness, but the drinkability suffers greatly from the lack of balance, you would have to be eating a wood grilled fish to enjoy this, couldn't finish the bottle.		The un-oaked version of this is much better."
"A sister of heineken, this came near from the amstel river, little more good than heineken, and grolsch, but good for the Mexican, special common drinker with Mexican food, and talk it with friends. good body, defined flavor. it is present at not so hard of the bitterness characteristic of American lager; new in my country, recommendable 75%."
"The description had me sold on this particular brew. I had spent the week camping in New York and in Stowe- so drinking this seemed fitting. I felt like I had the remains of a campfire in my mouth. 	This brew is not for everyone, but I think it is worth trying."
I wanted to try this beer to see if I could appreciate smoked beer and this one was a wizen to boot. Had this at the El Bait Shop in Des Moines. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a brown color with a medium head. Smells of smoked cheese and meat. Taste was mostly smokey too with the wheat trying to come through but failing. This beer was hard for me to drink. One bottle is more than enough for a night. Just not my style of beer.
"Thought there may have been something wrong with this one, but since all the other reviews seem to match my experience exactly, I'll throw my thoughts in as well.		The idea of beer and maple is probably the holy grail for Canadian beer drinkers. I don't know any Canadians who haven't dreamed of the day these two great things can be combined (well). A Maple Bock sounded like just what we had all been waiting for. Unfortunately, as has already been pointed out, something went wrong. 		To borrow from another review, cola is a pretty apt description for the pour and head, and like that reviewer I was still clinging to hope. 		Sweet aroma with a hint of maple in there somewhere, but it certainly doesn't jump out at you. 		I tried so hard to like it, but my taste buds put up too much of a fight. The sourness is overwhelming. Like the aroma, there was a maple hint somewhere in there but it was incredibly hard to get the taste and keep it, it was very slippery. Through all that there was a pleasant smokiness to the malt that was as elusive as the maple. These two notes hint at the possibility of a great beer, but this isn't it. 		The cloying sweetness kept me from even finishing the beer and my girlfriend refused the rare chance to finish one of my drinks after trying it herself. Keep dreaming maple lovers."
Canned. It probably would have been better closer to the source. Had it at a slightly warmer temperature than it should have been, but got the jist of the flavours. Watery with some barley sweetness, and light grassy hops, a bit uninteresting, i actually expected worse.
"I was really disappointed in this beer. I have good things about Founders, but this beer really disappointed. 		Appearance- Pours with a huge head that is really thin. Takes a couple of pours to fit in the glass. Cloudy yellowish brown color.		Smell-Smells like metal??? Almost no hint of hops.		Taste-The metal taste stays with the beer. Slight hop taste.		Mouthfeel-Overly carbonated.		Drinkability-Yea I can drink it but I am disappointed. I much prefer PA like Sierra Nevada and Mighy Arrow from New Belgium."
I was quite mixed on this beer. Considering it's my first time having a rauchbier, I was expecting a smoke beer. But this was pure smoke. I think Todd said it right, you either like this type or you don't. Sorry, but I for one don't. Poured out a dark brown color with very little carbonation. Smell. Yikes, all smoke, very little malt. Taste. Like eating a big fat sausage. Call me crazy, but the smoke flavor is a little too big. This beer isn't for my liking.
Pours a tawny deep maroon. Very thick and cloudy (yeast?). No light comes through this beer at all. Smells of caramel, chocolate, oak, licorice, molasses. This is a full nose for sure. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, almost chewable. Yet there was a slight crispness to it. Flavor is of syrup, booze, some woodsy notes, and big bourbon smack. This wasn't what I expected at all. Way too boozy and thick for my liking. Interesting beer.
"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a pint glass.		The color is a clear gold with a finger of foamy white head and no lacing.		The smell is a light spicy flavor and a bit of citrus flavor.		The taste seems to take a left turn and is a bit tough to place. A bitter flavor takes this beer from beginning to end and does kick in the aftertaste. A little too bitter and does not seem to come from any hops.		The feel of this beer is medium at first but seems to kick with a strong bitterness before long. Not my favorite import by far and a beer that would take some getting used to."
Appearance is DARK and clear. Smell is hoppy and very nice. The mouthfeel is creamy, thick and heavy. The taste is better up front and in the back of the mouth. Bitter start with a slight sweet finish. Overall this is a strong beer in flavor and in ABV. This beer will go well with anything HOT..
Pours amber orange in color with a decent head that retreated to a thin surface covering. Light aroma of nutmeg and cinnamon. Thin mouthfeel. This is a lackluster pumpkin ale. It has a vegetable, not even pumpkin, taste to it. Flavors are dominated with cinnamon and nutmeg. Too much nutmeg throws off the balance. Actually, there is no balance. Cinnamon sweetens this otherwise sleepy beer. Not much else going on here. Weak!
"A beer from the netherrlands; im happy for the heineken group thet introduce this beer in my country this year, i waiting for the 1870, meanwhile in the first the taste is like a kolsch, very pretty yellow color, hops, and rice are present in its smell, little lacing, mouthfeel like a genuine holland bier, but is still present the kolsch taste; good for mexican and snacks, drink from a bottle, 79% recommended."
There's no head with little lacing that doesn't stick very well. The smell is sweet brown with butterscotch. It's pungent like perfume, very very sweet perfume. It also has a slight spicyness. It's like wet/sweet wood or cardboard with a sweet sweet brown sugar with spices. Mouthfeel is a little smooth with some good carbonation. I wouldn't have another unless it was fresh only because I was told it was great.
"Appearance: A very appropriate golden colored beer with a nice white pillowy head. 		Smell: The smell was subtle - faint traces of wheat and yeast. A gentle sweetness that I couldn't place.		Taste: This beer tastes like a lager hidden in a giant glass of water. There are elements of bitterness, yeasts, hops, and even that sweetness I smelled. But its all super watered down. 	As of today, I have had 4 of these - so I'm pretty set on my feeling of the taste.		Summary: When you buy a sampler case from a brewery, there is always that one beer that you feel like they are trying to get rid of by putting it in with other (better) beers. This is that lesser beer."
This one will definately be revisited, interesting I think. I was expecting something on the lines os smokey scotch whisky, which I love (think Lavagulin or Talisker). The smell was promising, just enough smoke with malts. All I get on the pallete is smoke, like a barbecue or smokehouse, or my fireplace. I would probably enjoy aout 4 oz of this at the right time. To me this is definately not a quaffer. I will try it again paired with food.
A dark brown color with a bit of red. An interesting take on an Austrian/Mexican hybrid style beer. A guinness-esque aroma. The taste has bits of coffee and chocolate latter is more noticeable in the aftertaste. Again, always a pleasure to support the local Brewery.
"A beautiful beer. Coal black with a thin brown head.		Hints of chocolate, coffee, whiskey and hops in the nose.		Lots of roasted things going on. Extremely powerful flavors, but everything is muted by the intense alcohol. 		The alcohol is so strong (11.2%) you don't notice the bittering hops, just the burning sensation in your throat.		So strong and bitter it doesn't even feel good in your mouth.		If manly beers are your thing, this is the one for you; but it's far too strong to have more than one of these. Not very drinkable."
12 ounce bottle- pours a muddy caramel brown colour with next to no head and zero lacing. Nose- stale cereals, caramel, and healthy dose of yeast. Taste- very sweet, iced tea, mild tobacco, more caramel and yeasty. Carbonation is quite high which is suprising given the limp pour. Not really true to style at all. Not sure what to call this- not very good is a start..
In Canada this beer is called Lasko Club. Another 500ml can of eurolager in our Liqour stores. The colour is right and the head stays up bu the taste is weak and slightly sweet. This has to be the worst of the many lagers in cans available. I thought VB was bad but this is hard to finish. Give me Topvar or Konig instead of this mess.
The aroma is like an adjunct lager with lighter fluid, flowers and grass. The appearance is pale gold with a thin head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is right for the style. Overall it's not good but it's not horrible either. Still, I will not get another or drink another.
Flip top bottle sent to me from Europe as an extra in a trade. Light peachy colour, quick disapearing white head. Boozy and malty aroma. Medium mouthfeel suppoting a bozy peachy sweet sugary taste, with some acid aftertaste. Just too boozy to enjoy so not so drinkable.
"from a 40 into a glass.		A- not that impressive, kind of looks like the apple juice i once tried to ferment		S- good and strong smell to me. sweets, grains, strong fermented smell. just like that apple juice		T- yup, you guessed it, just like that apple juice... and ya, thats a bad thing. sweet and high in alcohol content.		M- actualy, better than its comparative apple juice haha. no nasua from the beer atleast.		D- im sorry, i wont be drinking this again. but its one more beer off the list"
"There is big 'ol root beer float colored head on this guy that stays just as long. It is a black brew with burgundy highlights. The nose is powerful. I get alcohol, chocolate, burnt caramel, big spicy hop aroma, and a slight vanilla creme. Alcohol is a little strong. 		Going in, I'm thinking a dry-hopped, roasty beer, with a rye kick is going to be either brilliant or a total punch in the palate. After sampling, I think it is both. The tounge braces with every sip to receive hop bitter, rye zing, spice, and roasty, burnt flavors all combining to pack a punch while blending so nicely you can't really tell where one character ends and the next begins. All this forefront action is held down by the firm hand of a deep, dark, chocolate-caramel tone that makes itself well-known. There is an aftertaste of bittersweet chocolate. 		The midwieght mouthfeel plays a perfect role here, supporting the beast without getting in the way. While I can't stop sipping this beer it is kinda hard to think more than one in a sitting. 		This beer is a marvel of architecture. Whoever brews this is showing off, and they deserve to because I doubt many brewers could pull this off so nicely. By all rights, this should taste like hate, but it is so well put together that it is awesome. Definately a different take on rye. Kind of the inverse of a dark lager."
"from day one of the CBC 20th anniversary party on may 8, 2009. served in small tulip or snifter (didn't include in my notes).		dark brown w amber/copper tint under the light. light tan head fades to singular wisp and ring. some thin, webby lace at first, but very little later on.		aroma: raisins and molasses, but very boozy. grassy hop and coffee note, but not enough to fight the booze.		taste: fruity cherries and caramel, with a peat smoke note to the roasted malt. lots of grassy, leafy hop with moderate bitterness. again however, this is very boozy. even as it warms, although some extra complexities emerge, they are never enough to fight the booziness.		medium body, but booze comes in again with a harsh, solvent astringency. mild to moderate carbonation doesn't help lift it away either.		my brother thought it was boozy too. what happened?"
"Appearance: Clear dark mahogany in color, with a massive, dense tan head, which retains well. The lacing is thin and broken. Small streams of minute bubbles drift lazily to the surface.		Aroma: Lots of earth, bitter cocoa, and cold coffee notes, as well as a fairly strong herbal hop presence. There is also an odd cooked vegetable note.		Taste: Opens with an odd cooked vegetable note, soon after, a wave of cold coffee appears, with a little earth. These flavors soon fade away, leaving a lingering charcoal note at the close.		Mouth feel: Thin and watery, with a little sting of carbonation.		Srinkability/notes: Rather disappointing, the flavors seemed very weak and understated, and the body was lacking. I like the American Porter style, and wanted to like this beer, especially since it is is brewed in Utah. There are few places in America less amenable to the manufacture of alcohol than Utah. I think that anyone who establishes a brewery in Utah is deserving of respect. Unfortunately, this beer misses the mark.		Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longn eck bottle with a twist-off crown, servedin a standard pint Pilsener glass."
"Holy hell this is black. And obviously thick just by how it pours. A finger of copper coffee colored creamy head sticks to the side of the glass. If you look closely at a large bubble, it has the look of oil slicked on water. Smells strongly of roast coffee bitterness with a hint of plumby sweetness.		Complex is an understatement, I can taste butterscotch, burnt maltlike coffee, that plumby syrupy sweetness and a bit of hop bittering. The alcohol is hidden. Feels thick and oily, slick and chewy in the mouth.		This beer is too big and thick for me, so it lost big onthe drinkability."
"Crystal-clear nut brown that displays a significant infusion of ruby, as well as bright orange edges, when held up to even minimal sunlight. The buff colored crown is nice looking and suggests quality brewing (here's hoping the rest of the beer follows suit). It's firm enough to maintain its structure for more than several minutes and leaves a respectable amount of lace in no particular pattern.		Tmavy Lezak smells like a garden variety Euro dark lager, although better than most. It is, at once, fruity and lightly caramel-like, with neither characteristic really overwhelming the other. Thankfully, I can appreciate very little of that stale mustiness that seems to emanate from the vast majority of EPLs and EDLs.		The flavor is flatter and less interesting than the aroma. While semi-interesting in the nose, it becomes 'beer by the numbers' on the palate. All style elements are in place, but the goods aren't delivered with enough panache. Many Euro dark lagers taste artificially flavored to me, as if the brewers used dark caramel syrup or extract to achieve the desired flavors rather than actual barley malt. This one tastes a little like that, although not horribly so.		The flavor profile consists of dark caramel, toasted nuts, mild cocoa and, again, the barest suggestion of musty hops. Sweet and bitter are both in the house, but neither one of them tries very hard. The mouthfeel is appropriate for the style and doesn't stand out in any way. A little more carbonation would add mouth interest since the flavor is so lacking in it.		Ferdinand Tmavy Lezak was beginning to make inroads against my dissatisfaction with the EDL style... until the all-important taste test. While far from horrible, it's yet another sub-par Czech beer that I can easily do without and will forget as soon as I toss the bottle into my recycling bin."
"This beer really misses the mark for a style that I consider one of my absolute favorites.		The color is much lighter than I am used to seeing, a clear bronze.		I'm not going to spend too much time on this review because honestly the beer is just not worth it.		The taste is way off the mark. Missing is the peaty smokiness and complex malt that a Wee Heavy should have. In its place is a somewhat medicinal flavor with a hint of sweet malt.		Pass if you have a better option."
Not bad for a lite lager. Golden pour with a weak malt scent. Fairly watery on the palate, although fuller than most other lites. Flavor is rather bland, there is a decent sharpness but it soon fades. Low abv isn't very helpful either. Many better choices out there.
"Something went wrong here. The beer looks fine and smells like a really bready basic lager (Note: label describes this as a ""European Lager""). Unfortunately there is a tremendous amount of yeasty sourness on the palate. I try to peer around the wave of acid broiling my mouth, but all I find is a faint sweet metallic flavor. Sour aluminum dust. Recycled airplane air. Try one of these just to see if our notes are consistent."
"The beer pours a clear blackened red, with a thick almondy colored head. Good head retention, with some clumpy lacing.	Aroma is a little thin, but mostly roasted malts. Chocolatey and dark roasted coffee. Dry hoppiness, with a very light hint of cherry.	Flavor is much the same, with hops providing only a little dryness in the finish and a light undertone to the roastiness. Some chocolate and coffee roastiness throughout the sip, although it seems a bit thin. Relatively high carbonation, with a light body.	Not very complex, and I found it to be almost identical to their porter, but i liked that better. Kind of dull and unassuming, not Cooperstown's best effort. My bottle may have been a bit old. I didn't entirely trust the store that I got it from."
"First note a perfume alcohol aroma, that becomes more boozy in time. Wheat aroma more than any discernible barley. Surprisingly simple and not as complex as I would have anticipated. The bourbon increases with time.	Because of the heaviness of the drink the golden amber as has glow appearance. A short live small dense head becomes a light ring on the edge and small island of white in the middle. 	Flavor is less over the top than the aroma. Still boozy, but more tame and held back enough to bring out some wheat. I'm finding the maple quite difficult to locate - a little shows as it warms, but it's insufficient unfortunately.	Nice and heavy feel. Alcohol is even a little warm in the beginning, not just in the gut.	Disappointing, actually. Lack flavors beyond the bourbon barrel. Too big and lacking flavors from the malts to balance off the alcohol and bourbon.	I'm in no hurry to try the other bottles. I'll sit on them and see if they mellow with time."
"Sampled this beer at Founders own tap room.	The beer was way too sweet. Taste was less impressive as it warmed in the glass. The malts from the stout style could not overcome the maple and and sweetness from the high gravity. I did not finish the beer. That rarely happens, I almost never orphan a beer. Founders has many beers that are excellent, this was not one of them."
WOW!!! This beer is driven by grain....no question!!!! The color is yellow and clear with thin white head. The scent is grain. The taste is a very sharp grain...I mean no question. Its hard to be smooth when you are this sharp. Mouthfeel is tough....would not order this again.
"EDIT: downgraded after a second sharing by nickd717. Thanks, Nick. But I firmly maintain that this is a lot of whiskey. 		--- 		Chilled bottle into a glass. Donated by cpferris for a tasting at ipa247's house in December. Thanks, Chad and Jeff. 		From notes. 		A: Pours a clear, but very dark, reddish brown body. Half a finger of light beige head. Short retention, with a thin collar and some bubbles on top. 		S: Whiskey... Wow. It's like the glass is 2/3 spirits with a little beer. Caramel, tannins, vanilla. I enjoy whiskey, but I prefer more balance in my beers, and this doesn't deliver. 		T: Whiskey (strong), caramel, tannins, vanilla. Nice grainy oatmeal in the mid-taste, with some raisin highlights. Chocolate in the finish. But again, it's BIG on the whiskey. Can't say that's particularly a great thing. 		M: Very viscous, pretty smooth. I had no trouble putting this down, as the heat was restrained. 		D: For a whiskey-bomb I'd go straight to this. But, as said above, I like my beers with more balance and nuance and subtlety. While I wouldn't turn this beer down, I wouldn't chase it down for myself. Out of all the barrel-aged impy stouts I've tried, this doesn't distinguish itself as being particularly top-tier."
"I wish I had remembered that I had tried Lobster Lover's beer from this brewery, and really didn't like either version that I tried. I thought this bock was worth a try, but I was sadly mistaken.	In a pint glass this beer was a gold color with just a rim of white head.	Strong aroma of alcohol, not pleasant, with a bit of sweet malt.	Mostly boozy taste, a tiny bit of caramel malt.	The mouthfeel was very sharp. Can't believe this is a bock. It bears no resemblence to a bock."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. No dating present. Clear, light yellow body. Good white head initially, but it fades quickly and leaves nothing behind.		Very light aroma of lager yeast and a touch of grain. Not much going on.		The flavor is only slightly better. A little light grain and the slightest hint of hops (noble?). Very weak overall.		Nearly the same consistency as water. I did not find this beer offensive, but it was not very good either."
Had to grab this when I saw it last week. Such a strange concept to me. It pours a slightly pinked brown color wtih a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose has sweet berry tones that pretty well dominate much else that is there. The flavor is pretty mellow, starting with the sweetness of the berry and moving to more of a nutty maltyness. I'm not a big fan. The feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, I don't think that berries belong in a scottish. I don't think this was a great scottish base beer either. It just seems lacking all around.
"Thanks to recall1242 for sending me this one!		Pours a clear honey orange with a 1/2 inch fizzy off-white head that settles to nothing. No lacing on this one whatsoever. Smell is very spice forward with the cinnamon coming across as cinnamon flavored gum. I am also getting some minor malt and pumpkin aromas. Taste is of cinnamon gum right off the bat, followed by other pumpkin pie spices. Actual malt and pumpkin flavors are very subdued overall. This beer does have a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is just not a very good beer. All the components are average or above but all together this beer is too one dimensional with the overwhelming spice (especially cinnamon) smells and tastes."
"Served on draught in Kelly's bar in Galway, Ireland, one of two pubs that I know serves it (the other being the Bierhaus). Served in a Pilsener Urquell pint glass. The barmaid double-poured it. I wonder if this is standard practice in the Czech Republic. 		A: Pours a clear pale gold with a beautifully thick, creamy head of excellent retention. 		Sm: Very very light. Just fresh treated barley. 		T: Brilliant. Complex body perfectly balances hops, barley, and malt. Delightfully crisp finish; unique I think to this beer. The finish has its own taste, the third act in a well-done play. The open is a bit rushed. 		Mf: Masterful balancing of dryness, coarseness, and smoothness. Feels nicely smooth without being watery. Built on top of the smoothness is a coarse fizziness about halfway through that dies just before the finish making me want more. 		Dr: At four quid, it's a tough call on whether to get it over Guinness in an Irish pub. When you're in a pilsener mood, this is the beer to go to. Certainly, Czech prices would make this beer an excellent choice."
"As much as I would like to believe this is better then BMC Light, it isn't. Simply add an off-putting skunky import wang to any typical light beer and you have Amstel Light. Yes, I know the skunkiness is the unique component to all those ""great"" import lagers, but Amstel is just plain worthless. At least with Bud Miller Coors you get a beer over 4% ABV. And to pay a premium for this stuff? Nah."
"Brown glass bottle served into a Beck's flute in Castle Rock, Colorado. Reviewed live. 		A: Three finger head of fair cream, great thickness, and good retention. Colour is a solid black. 		Sm: Chocolate, toffee, nuts, and cream. A mild strength aroma. 		T: Heavy chocolate, decent nuts, light cream, and light caramel. Complex enough, but badly built and balanced. 		Mf: Smooth and wet; fairly complementary of the flavour but not the style. 		Dr: Fairly high ABV, drinkable enough, and decently priced."
"500ml bottle. Pours clear gold with a nice white head that lasts and leaves good lacing. Smells fairly sweet; almost exactly like straw. A bit earthy. Tastes of pils malt, with a strong cereal character. Like, plain Cheerios. Not much else going on there. Slight hop bitterness at the end. A bit unpleasant, actually, in the middle. Light body and decent carbonation. This one was interesting. Not totally offensive, and surely the nicest ""free"" beer I've had, but not anywhere near good. Reminds me of what you would get if you had a bowl of cereal and used Perrier instead of milk, ate the cereal, and then drank what was left over."
First pumpkin ale of the fall season. I look forward to fall on the beer calendar for so many reasons, one being pumpkin ales. This one, however, better not be a sign of whats to come this year. This beer is BORING! The appearance is a clear golden, with a rusty body. The aroma is decent, but there is just not enough of it. When I am having a pumkin ale, I want the spices to come out and punch me in the face. This one is very timid with nutmeg being the biggest producer of smell. The taste is very thin and lacks any luster. Small hints of vanilla and cloves find their way through, but it is incredibly unappealing. Thankfully, I only bought two bottles of this. In my honest opinion, this is exactly what I would expect from AB or Miller if they brewed a pumpkin. Blahhh, this is boring!
"A vigorous swirling of the bottle results in only nominal cloudiness to the full light gold color. Quickly dissipating fizzy head ends in a barely there and largely incomplete cap.		Nose is crisp malt, with some wheaty notes present, as well as a very, very subtle phenolic character.		Palate is malty and full, but there is little to support or balance the malt. Ultimately lacking in complexity and interest."
"Menu at the brewpub listed this as follows on January 10, 2006, for on-tap:		ABV -- 7.9%	IBU -- 40.8		Appearance was clear dark amber/mahogany, but no head -- I don't know why, but they draw all their beers here with virtually no head. 		Smell was surprisingly fruity , with a cherry pie note and burnt sugar.		Taste was a bit over-hopped for my palate, with pepper and clove: a reminder of anissette liquer.		Mouthfeel was nice and round.		Drinkability was diminished by the high ABV.		Definitely not the BBC's best offering."
"A: Musty orange color with a sea foam like head. Lots of lacing in the glass, and a medium to medium low level of carbonation.		S: Rich piney and citrusy hops, with a mild malty grain back bone. Touches of wood and corn are noted. Slightly out of the ordinary, and not a bad change up.		T: Hops right of the bat, with a distinct orange peel character flowing over the light biscuit and flour note. Soapy bitterness seems to detract from the enjoyablity of this beer. Rather uninspiring, and the orange flavor is kind of bothering me...		M: A little on the light side, lacking the oily and dense feeling that I look for in American IPA's.		D: Fair. Don't think I'll be seeing this one again anytime soon."
"Poured bright pink with now head at all, lookes more like a wine cooler than a beer.		Smells like fresh tart raspberries.		Taste exactly like the smell, like raspberries, absolutely no standard beer flavors at all, no detectable malt, no hops, no yeast, just sweet and sour raspberries.		Mouthfeel is light and slightly slick		Overall the flavor isn't bad, but has absolutely no beer qualities, taste as much like beer as the Smirnoffs, Bacardi's, and Bartles and James of the world. I will avoid this one. The first let down I have had from founders."
"WOW this is kinda bad...in a word...yeah	so um ok...appearance was semi nothing...it poured a very light clear color and the can it came in looked like the cover for some lame japanese cartoon...the smell was not apparent at all i tried so hard that i managed to inhale some of it through my nose...i wouldnt recomend that...it stings...so yea moving on the taste was not very apparent either, carbination and a water-esque taste with a hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel wasnt much better than the rest of it. The mouthfell was very watery and carbonated. Drinkability was a 2 and thats only if you wanna get smashed on a low budget."
"Served in a Chicago Bears shaker pint glass.		I'm a ChiSox fan and quite the ticker. This is not a necessarily good combination when random, new, Sox-themed beers come about. This one arrived in my area a couple days ago. $1.79 for a 24oz can. Based on experience, this is not a good start. It pours a clear pale-ish golden straw topped by a finger of white, craggy foam. The nose comprises corn, flour, corn syrup, light biscuit, semi-sweet flowers, and grass. It's not too bad, so far. The taste, though, finally brings the quasi-expected storm: notes of corn syrup, sweetgrass, flowers, rice cake, honey, hard water, and fresh-from-the-cob corn. Wow, this stuff is somehow both sickly sweet and mineral-laden-ly vegetative. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat syrupy feel. Just like the taste, the feel is kinda oxymoronic, feeling both smoothly flowing and thickly stiff. I'm definitely not smiling with this stuff on my tongue. Overall, Big Frank said he wouldn't put his name on a bad beer. Looks like he was right: This is a downright crappy beer. Of course, with that ABV and the other options around, I'd probably still drink this at The Cell if the Sox don't start improving soon: Something's gotta take my mind off of the sadness on the field. Definitely sadness here in this can..."
"A--Very dark, murky amber color with about a finger of head with good lacing		S--Wow this is very odd smelling. I'm having a tough time putting my finger on this, its like some sort of candy sweetness. Whatever it is, it is kind of offensive in a beer. I once tried a Bubbalicious gum that was filled with some strawberry liquid, and this kind of smells like that liquid. Unfortunately, the gum was gross.		T--For a beer called ""hopdinger"" you would really expect to taste some hops in it. Unfortunately this is almost 100% malty sweetness. Now, I'm not the type of person that says ""its too sweet to drink."" If it is tasty then it is tasty. But this is just empty, its like drinking a candy beer only the candy is generic and expired and watered down.		M--Medium bodied yet still feels very watery		D--I don't even want to finish this, really. It sort of tastes like something Anheuser Busch would put out under a new brand name to trying and convince people it is ""premium"""
"If I&G is aged in oak bourbon casks, Trafalgar was brewed in a roadside stand beside that famous old tree on Bronte Rd.	It just seems so...simulated. 	I mean, they try hard, really hard. But again it's spread too thin.		A rapidly dissipating head of less than a quarter of an inch.	On the nose a faint oak beneath a slice of raisin bread forgotten in the toaster. Molasses, and what seems to be the go-to for Trafalgar: cloves. Welcoming, but not enough for me to lower my guard.		Much of the same in the mouth. Brown sugar sweetness, with the somewhat off oakiness dominating. This brewery seems to have a difficult time masking alcohol.	It's very astringent, not just dry.	Maybe there's a reason. It is a big bottle to fight through.		It's supposed to be that sour. Forget the oak cover-up in next batch, and this may be the savior."
"Thanks to Jackie for pointing out the exact flavor of this beer... Cherry tootsie pops.		There's nothing inherently wrong with cherry tootsie pops. But some things just don't work well in beer. Fruity candies are one of them.		I was hoping there would just be a hint of the chocolate and cherry flavors, but it went overboard. Not only that, the choices for each were poor. It was much too sugary tasting, and I just didn't feel like finishing it."
"Branded as ""Maple Leaf Lager"" and issued right before Canada Day. Says Elora Grand Lager in small print. Sneaky, I thought I was getting a new beer. I reviewed this last fall on my blog and wasn't impressed.		Pours a pale golden color with a sizable soapy white head that burns off after a minute leaving minimal lace.		Smells like honey-sweetened wet, mossy wood. Smokey dirt, freshwater and a trace of hops.		Tastes better than it used to, but still not great at all. Wet grains and a buttery note accented by a dirtiness before an overly salty aftertaste kicks in.		Light-bodied with a medium carbonation. Starts dry but goes sour in the finish. Combined with the salty aftertaste it's rather unappealing.		I have enjoyed a few products from this brewery in the past, but Elora Grand Lager is not one of them. A thin body, dirty smell and salty aftertaste add up to a disappointing experience. Why this is their flagship beer or keeps ending up in OCB samplers is a mystery I'll never solve."
Pours a clean, pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, saaz hops, a sweet malt, and a small skunk like smell. In the taste, watery, a small sweet malt and a small hop bite. A small bite and light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to clean aftertaste. Standard export lager, nothing impressive.
"A - Poured from bottle into glass with a golden reddish color and little to no head. if there was a head i might have missed it.	S - Smells like the gym room after we did five laps. horrible smelling brew. i have no idea why people drink this.	T - Tastes just as bad as the smell. Garbage	D - Drink one just so u know what we are talking about. i really think this is a bad beer and i would not drink it if it was the last beer on earth."
"My first foray into the world of Rauchbiers.		Pours a semi-opaque, dark mahogany brown with a small head that lingers for about 30 seconds and leaves minimal lacing.		Aroma is extremely interesting. Obviously the first thing that hits you is the smoky smell of the malt. There are dark fruits (plum, fig, overripe papaya) as well as brown sugar and some .. umm.. roasted potatoes?		Taste was surprisingly good. I was afraid that the smoke flavor would overwhelm, but it was subtle, and therefore complemented the marzen. This one also gets more complex as it warms, and the nuances are too much to review here.Spice,.caramel, smoky malt, dark fruit/floral.. very nice.		Mouthfeel was a bit chewy, lingering on the tongue for a few seconds. A good beer, certainly worth a try, but not sessionable by any means."
"Got this while driving from PA back through to Cincinnati at West Point Market in Akron, Ohio. Per the employee at the store, this ale is only distributed in the Akron area, but I'm not certain I believe that 100%.		Appearance: No freshness date seen. Poured from a bomber it my traditional pint glass. Pour a clear, bright pale yellow with the slightest tinge of purple, definitely a unique look. A brief, ultra-white fizzy head disappeared quickly leaving what looks like a flat 7up. No other carbonation lingered.		Smell: Smells like a super-sweetened raspberry, not natural. Further sniffing brings the slightest wheats or bready malts.		Taste: Flat! This is beer? Wow, to me it tasted like a flat cream soda with no bite whatsoever. Vanilla, craminess and the slightest artificial candied raspberry flavor detected. What was this, a flat raspberry Zima?		Mouthfeel: Flat and wet, no dryness detected. No carbonation. Blah...		Drinkability: Sorry, no thanks. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it for the sake of getting another fruit/vegetable beer review under my belt, but I won't be getting this one again."
"12oz. bottle poured into an imperial pint. Best before June 15, 2010. Thanks to BeerFMAndy for the bottle. 		(A)- Pours a clear caramel-like amber color. Produced an immediately dissipating white head. 		(S)- A sweet corn meal & corn husk with hay. 		(T)- Same as the smell. A really grass-like, almost sour hay with tons of corn meal. Bitter. 		(M)- A good carbonation level. A very bitter/grassy/sweet yet sour corn thing. 		(D)- Not a big fan of the bitter grass that turn almost sour. Just tastes like corn otherwise. Doesnt remind me of an oktoberfest much."
"Serving : corked and caged 750ml bottle, freshness date, best before 12/2007		Reveals a translucent deep mahogany color with ruby highlights all topped by a beige one and a half finger thick head. Lacing coats the inside of the glass just above a paper thin foamy cap, remnants of the once impressive head. Some life is left in this beer with a dab of lively, fine carbonation rising to the surface.		Carob, corriander, earthy spice, aromas are represented on this beer's nose along with a bit of roasted malts, light brown sugar, pain grille and bitter hops.		A rush of bitter carob, smokey malts, and tons of corriander hit the palate upon initial entry and domainate through the malty mid palate to the semi-dry lingering finish of leafy bitter hops and sour fruit. Earthy spices, leafy bitterness and sour citrus fruit are very overwhelming and quite unpleasant. Malt backbone is lacking, hops are leafy and bitter and spices flavors are far too overpowering. One redeeming quality is I don't notice the alcohol, it is well hidden underneath other less desirable flavors, I'd rather have the alcohol!		A bit thin for a belgian brown ale, it doesn't have any of the cloying sweet character that coats the mouth and palate which are evident in other examples of this style. The lingering finish and grip, no matter how repugnant, is admirable. Overpowering spicyness and sour fruit on the finish make for poor drinkability.		Artisanal brown ale? Maybe this is for some eccentric beer drinkers but I was expecting a lot more from this beer, especially considering the cost of one 750ml bottle. This just goes to show that not every beer in a fancy bottle with a label boasting it's artisanal is worth drinking nor buying for that matter!		I will have to revisit this one. It is very likely this bottle was tainted or spoiled, though the bottle and beer appeared fine, plus the freshness date indicated it was still good. With so many off flavors I just find it hard to believe this is the real deal."
"A 99cent 24oz. can with a date code on the bottom and a caption that reads: ""Hold It down""...wonder what that's suppose to mean ? Anyway, it pours a light golden yellow with a finger of white foamy head. To my amazement, the head had good retention and there was some decent looking lace involved.		The smell is sweet and malty with notes of corn adjuncts and hot alcohol when it warms up. Doesn't really smell all that bad, but it lacks any hop presence.		The taste on the other hand, not so good. Very, very sweet and cloying with a hot alcoholic over profile throughout. Tastes like sweet corn syrup , Nutri-Sweet and malt-beverage like alcohol...I've tasted worse, but not much.		With a medium body and good carbonation, the mouthfeel is pretty slick and smooth with an astringent feel on the tongue in the finish.		Drinkabilty...no thank-you, definitely not for me !"
"I was disappointed with this beer. I am huge Founders fan and the six pack I bought was quite expensive. 		The color of this beer was a very unapealing pink/red. The taste of the beer was very bitter and sour (not in a good way). The aroma was not strong enough for a fruit beer like this. I have had many other rasberry beers that were better than this."
"Poured a dark brown with a modest head.		Smelled a bit like chocolate and dried pit fruit.		Tasted like, well, dust & dead flowers (as someone put it). A sweet malt-bomb through & through. I suspect it was well past it's prime...		Overall, just couldn't finish my share of the bottle. It's noted here that it's retired, so maybe theres a reason for that."
"This beer is terrible. Really, really bad. 		Specific things that I hated about this beer:		-way too fucking sweet	-no hop flavour	-the aroma smells like cheap sugary toffee	-no carbonation	-no head retention		I couldn't stomach this beer and poured it down the drain.		Really this brewery should be ashamed to release something this bad."
"Poured a bright orange with lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of sediment. Easily the chunkiest beer I have ever seen. A light soap ring of a head.		Doesn't really smell all that hoppy for a TRIPEL IPA, a light medicinal quality with a bit of mineral.		The flavor is a big grassy bitter mess, mild toasted malts sort of sneak through, but its bitter herbal and grassy hops. It seems to be missing most of the tasty hop flavors and just full of bitterness and old lawn clippings with some alcohol sweetness.		The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, literally chewy.		This beer is an absolut train wreck of a giant IPA, will avoid in the future."
"The colour is very pale straw yellow. The white finger thick head is airy and surprisingly firm. No lacing. 		The smell is sweet with some frowsy notes of old yeast. There is also a mild metallic bitter note. 		The taste got some dough-like malt, a hint of yeast and broth. The aftertaste is medium bitter with metallic chemical flavours.		The carbonation is average; very small bubbles. The liquid is very watery. 		Yet another dull lager."
"Hmmm, well, I really wanted to like this beer, seeing as how there are a few of them in my fridge. However, it definitely made middle grades, at best.		Poured a color best described as iced tea red-brown. Little head, not much lacing.		Smell is, well, not the best. Citrusy with something else, that at first eluded my memory banks - then it came back to me - stale bong water. (They told me my memory would be affected - damn!) Can't smell much malt, and maybe these were bad Centennial hops? I've had them be too grassy, but never like this.		Taste - odd. Simply put. Sorta feel the hops and yet you don't. Complex, but not in a good way. Maltiness appears once beer warms slightly, as does some alchohol backbone, but not enough to save my tastebuds and make this a good taste. Avergae at best.		Mouthfeel - much like the taste - strange, unique, and all still not in a ""want another one"" way. Guess that says something about the drinkability, as well."
I was excited to try this as I loved the Zywiec Porter. It poured a brownish black color with a one finger tan head. Smell was intensely sweet, alcohol soaked fruit, and honey. Flavor was much of the same with a smoky overtone to everything and big sweetness, predominantly honey. I wasn't too fond of the combination of smokiness with fruit. This is a unique brew therefore I couldn't give it a bad rating, but I couldn't drink too many of these.
"Bomber from the Lik-Bo:		Pours a pale ale with a pink tint in the glass. No cap to speak of, left very little lace on the glass.		Faint nose...bit of boiled cereals, light grassy tones some berry notes.		Thin mouth feel. Weak malt presence in front, some light bittering, light berry fruit adds minimal tartness, fast watery uneventful finish.		Uninspired fast summer knock-off, no off tastes but just thin watery and pointless. Disappointing."
"A - Yellow - gold color with a decent one and a half finger head. Lacing is moderate. A couple large bubbles cling around the bottom of the glass. Decent look . . . hell, if this wasn't a forty, I might even be excited.		S - Corn, alcohol and grassy hops.		T - Corn, musky grain, a bit of paint thinner and glue. Aftertaste consists of offensive chemicals that make paint thinner and glue seem like something to look forward to having.		M - High carbonation, thin body, mildly refreshment.		D - Poor. The little that I had was hard to handle."
For a 40, it could be worse. Your typical malt beverage orange color, not much head to speak of. Smells a little rancid but you can tell there's actually some toasted malt in there, or some sort of cheap immitaion malt or someting, I don't know how they do it and I don't really care. Taste is a little less pukey than the smell, but really isn't appetizing. My friends convinced me to pound this big boy last night and on one other occasion this summer, and both times I've woken up extremely hung over. This stuff is bad for you. Only drink it if you're in 9th grade. Word.
"(Served in an American pint glass)		A- This beer has a brown translucent body with a creamy off-white head.		S- The smell of blackberry and biscuit malt is a bad combination. There is a note of chocolate malt and dark roasted malt that doesn't help the almost putrid smell. 		T- The taste of dry biscuit malt and fresh grain has a faint blackberry extract note to it in the finish. 		M- This beer has a medium light mouthfeel and a slight watery texture. 		D- These flavors really don't taste good together but if the blackberry extract flavor was removed or replaced with a real fresh blackberry flavor there is some hope for this beer. It needs to go back to the drawing board."
"A: Very nice color, like pale amber very brigth also good head wuth a ligth beige color that disipates not slow not fast with good retention.		S: Hops and more hops with a faint sweit or fruit inside.		T: Hops all along, bitter since the beginning a very bitter ending that last just good enough.		M: Meddium body can be sensed, with a refreshing sensation but bittenress is always present"
"Poured this 12 oz. brown bottle into a Guinness tulip glass. No date. The body was a dull, hazy orange/brown, sort of like an old penny. A very modest head left a fine film, but no real lacing.		Smell was grainy with a mild sour snap. Dark fruits. Bready. Maybe some floral notes. Aroma is the most interesting aspect of this beer.		Taste was disappointing. I love rye beers, I love hoppy beers, and I've never had a hemp beer but I was very hopeful when trying this amber ale. Primarily malty in flavor. There was a mild spiciness. Some nutty notes. Dirty, not clean at all. Hops were very under-represented here. I'm not sure how they thought it was a good ideal to call this beer ""Hemp Hop Rye"", Hemp Malt Rye would have been much more appropriate. Dull and uninteresting.		Mouthfeel was undercarbonated. Medium to full bodied, seems too heavy for the style."
"I must be masochistic, coz I can't for the life of me explain why I sometimes still drink this.		Weak, watery, unimpressing smell and taste, there's the expected hops and some malt, but ye gods, why on earth is this beer so omnipresent and popular (pun intended)?		Every once in a while, on a warm terrace in Greece, I let my guard down and order me one of these, immediately regretting it on the first sip. Tohether with Heineken, Bud and the likes, I tend to give this the label ""industrial waste"".		Stay clear of it, there's hundreds of beers more worthy of the name out there."
Pours a ruddy dark brown color with decent foam that left behind very little lacing. Big aroma of smoked meats and fish. i know this is usual for the style, but man, i don't like it all that much. Flavor is about the same. Big and smokey. Smoke flavors trumps everything else, but there is a nice sweet, weizen base that occasionally pokes it's head through. Creamy mouthfeel, decent carbonation. Not so easy to drink because of all the smoked meat and fish attributes going on. If you like your beer brimming with smoked malts a twist of beef jerky, with a dash of bacon, than this one's for you!
"AromaIs extremely sweet. There's an immediate caramel presence there, and a definite dark fruit not as well, most notably cherries. This could pass for candy.		Pours blood red in the glass with a small head.		Taste is extremely malty as would be expected. Very rich caramel and dark fruit is present in abundance along with some serious sugar. This isn't for diabetics. The problem I have is how boozy this is right from the start. It hits right away, like a shot of bourbon is in this beer. And on the finish, it only gathers steam. The ABV is high, but drinks even higher.		So the verdict is that this isn't a favorite beer from Founders for me. Not a big deal, they make plenty other good ones."
I let it warm a tiny bit before trying. Poured with an average light tan head that quickly subsided to a very thin cover, ring, and a tiny bit of lace. Color is hazy/cloudy brown amber. Aroma is malt, toffee, roast, caramel. Flavor is similar, plus has the carbonic tang, a little peat, and not much sweet also has a shade of sour that makes me think it's turning.. Body is perhaps a bit thin and carbonation a bit forced. Finish is like flavor and of average length.
Pours a cloudy dark amber with an off white foamy head. There seemed to be a big amount of carbonation from the bottom of the glass. The head stayed for almost the duration of the beer, and there was a fair amount of lace on the glass. The smells was a wonderfully oaky, smoke smell that was not overwhelming but actually quite pleasant. I continuously smelled this beer as I drank it. Taste was slightly sour, with hints of smoke at the end. Wow! It may sound strange, but this works. Body was thin to medium and there was a good amount of carbonation. I am not sure if this is very drinkable, but I would certainly have it again perhaps with some type of sausage.
Straw golden color with very little foam. The aroma is light, but malty. After beer began to warm other odd scents developed, reminds me of cow feed or maybe an old granary. Palate is light. The flavors are pale malt with a twist of corn. The finish is dry with only a hint of bitterness. As the temperature increases the flavors become more unpleasant and still more unpleasant. Keep it ice cold and drink fast.
"Pours a light straw color and has somewhat of a head.	Smells of yeast and a bit of what I seem to smell in most imported beers, which is probably the yeast.	Tastes like a bit of an average beer, nothing special. Yeast and malts... not much else. Has an interesting aftertaste similar to grass. 		Not something I would buy again."
"A: Amber in color just like a pale ale!		S: Light hop aroma so I'm told. I couldn't smell anything.		T: More hop than malt. Not a great balance but also not terrible.		M: Other than that bitterness in the back of my throat I'd say it's about average for the style.		D: They say full flavor dances on the palate but after this one I'm ready for something else."
"A slightly fruity aroma however but no fruitiness in the flavor. (It was kind of surprising as the aroma and flavor were like two separate beers.) 		Some hoppiness accompanies a very mild beer. Body is very light, almost watery. 		Not a bad beer per say, but nothing very impressive..."
"A - Copper/caramel color with a thick white head which left a medium lacing upon dissipation.		S - Grain, tried to pick up more than that, but could not. Perhaps it smells like both grain and malt liquor.		T - Tastes like it smells; plain grain. Tasted very similar to American Pale Lagers, perhaps Budweiser. Maybe a hint of green grapes.		M - Thin, dry with a slight spice in the tip of the tongue.		O - Not impressed. Maybe it would be better for people who appreciate the nostalgia from the Monty Python movie, but I don't care for it and will definitely not buy this beer again."
"Pours a slightly murky ruby and copper color with a small and super quick head and faintly syrupy looking consistancy. The aroma is ""Holy Christmas!"" Cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamon, ginger, and mace blast the nostrils every sip. Maybe some caramel malts hidden away in the aroma down there. The aroma is good, but a touch too much on the spices. The taste is full frontal assault of spices that last through all of the fron, most of the middle, and mellows out on the finish. Some sweet biscuit malts peak through the X-mas spice haze on the finish. As the beer warms, the alcohol really adds some fire to the cinnamon and ginger especially in the back of the throat. This beer is good for Christmas only. I could only drink one bottle, once a year and thats it thank you."
"A - Pours a clear golden orange color. A slight white head fizzles up and dissipates within seconds. No lacing left here and has a few, very small carbonation bubbles.		S - Smells of sweet grains with alcohol with a touch of melon.		T - Very sweet. Grains of corn and wheat mixed with warming alcohol. There are some slight fruity notes. The end is a bitter sort of chalky kind of taste. Eh. 		M - I find with sub-par beers such as this one, the mouthfeel usually gives them their only good qualities. Good amount of carbonation and goes down smooth.		D - Not a good taste, higher ABV, I might not finish this."
"I usually really enjoy drinking Founder's brews. This is the first exception. I have seen this in 4-packs all over the place, and I have been meaning to pick one up, but this was the first time I have seen it on tap (at the Tally Ho in Bethlehem, PA). So I order one.		Watching the bartender pour I immediately notice this beer has an almost unnatural red tint to it. It holds almost no head, but it still looks a little promising. As he places it down in front of me I am overloaded with raspberry smells. It is nice as an air freshener, but I am now concerned. I take a sip and immediately identify the ""fake"" taste of sour raspberries. It is missing much of the character that Founder's usually has from its selection of hops and malts. I couldn't finish this, as it reminded me of raspberry pucker. Somewhere someone probably really likes this brew, but it was way too sweet for me.		Sorry Founder's, but this seems like you tried too hard and failed. I will never have this again. I'll still have other Founder's brews because of there fairly good track record with me."
"12oz bottle; more elaborate label that the one pictured		Orangey-straw color with a thin ring of white bubble, no lacing.		Smells sweet and slightly bready.		Not much taste, light caramel.		Very watery mouthfeel, besides the carbonation sting.		I wouldn't normally buy this beer anyway (was brought back from a roadtrip by my brother), but I won't be buying or drinking it again. Very light, very watery and trace hops- almost tastes like an Non-Alcoholic beer."
"Sampled on 7-10-09		Pours a hazy golden color, with a short-lasting fizzy white head that fades completely away, leaving no lacing.		Smell is sweet and boozy, very malt liquor. A little bready, and quite sharp.		Taste is exactly as expected, malt liquor with a slightly vegetable aftertaste. At least the alcohol isn't offensive.		Mouthfeel is thin but syrupy, and sticks to the palate.		Drinkability is decent, if your goal is drunk.		Overall, at least I got to try a Lithuanian beer."
"From the bottle into a Brooklyn tulip.		Pours a golden orange, with no head. None, as in little to no carbonation. Smells of cinnamon, spices and a ""typical"" pumpkin beer. Smell wasn't bad, but the tasete, here we go...overly sweet, overly spiced and an unbalanced mess. Comepletely one diminsional throughout. No body at all and seemed way thin. Would've been a pour, but it was all I had for the day before Halloween."
"What's with all the fuss over this beer? Well, I'm going to see if I can find out. On to the beer:		A lighter blonde in color with a pretty thin head. Retention is okay. It has a smell of cooked veggies, some grain, and sulfur. So far, it's not living up to the hype, and no, it won't. The taste is mildly astrigent with husk...wait, is that corn I'm also tasting? That's not very European to me. The bitterness is light and rides in the form of the carbonation and a touch of hop. Finishes pretty dry. 		It might be a shade better than the Big 3 Lights. but that doesn't justify the high prices this costs. In the category of light beer, Michelob Light tastes better and won't cost you an arm and a leg."
"I just picked up a large bottle of this one at a Liquor Barn while passing through Louisville. The bottle says it's bottle-conditioned, but there's no hint of a bottling date or freshness date. 		The bottle opened with a forceful release of CO2. It poured a murky amber color with a creamy finger or two of head. The aroma was lacking fresh hops. After tasting this brew, I just don't see how it can be fresh, but without a date...who knows for sure? There aren't any off-flavors, but you're really only left with an aged malt character and a fairly clean bitterness...and no hops in the flavor either. Does BBC really intend this beer to taste like it does? I'm not totally sure, but I doubt it. I really wish I could taste a brewery-fresh version of this one. It really sucks when breweries don't use any form of date-coding on their bottles! As it stands, I got ripped off by buying these bottles of beer. (I also bought a bottle of Professor Gesser's IPA at the same store. Guess what? Same problem...but even worse tasting beer which I ended up dumping just like the Homewrecker.) ARGH! Come on BBC, date-code your bottles! It appears BBC took the time to hand-bottled these special brews. Why not go ahead and include a month/year bottling date as well, even if it's just hand-written on the label? I've bought beers from other breweries which had hand-written numbers on them. I'm guessing these BBC beers might be quite good when fresh, but now I'm afraid to buy any more BBC brews when passing through KY."
"Bottle (2011)		Acquired via trade	Thanks, MrHirschybar!		Clear ruby grapefruit in color with deep, dark auburn edges and a thin khaki colored head that leaves the glass completely sticky and messy with sheets, spots, and lines of lacing.		I've never really quite known what people meant when they said their IPA smells like onion, until now! This beer is full of raw onion aroma--not quite enough to make me cry, but, it's starting to feel like I should! There's a bit of earth and grass character as well, along with some garlic, strangely enough, but the onion aroma is certainly dominant.		This is drinkable, but hardly. The onion and garlic flavors present again, and those aren't exactly flavors I look for in my DIPAs. The level of bitterness is huge, there's a touch of warming alcohol, though not nearly as much I feared. There's some piney and citrus hop flavors hidden underneath there somewhere...maybe?		Medium mouthfeel, oily, with low carbonation.		I wish I could bottle the rest of this so my friends could taste how terrible it is. I'm cruel.		**If given the chance to try this beer fresh, I will revisit my review, as the bottle I had was about 5 months old.**"
"Triple IPA, huh? Well, at 12% it may qualify. Does that make DFH 120 Minute the first TIPA? 		It is dark amber and hazy like many DIPAs out there and raises a nice head of off-white foam that has really good retention. We'll see if the haze is the usual chill haze you get from highly hopped beers...I suspect it is.		There is some serious pine action going on in the smell, but it's pretty solvent in nature. It's almost as if I could clean my floors replete with a bald man, arms crossed, looking on in approval. But there's more going on here and I believe it's from the alcohol level. It's where the solvent is coming from which led to the Mr. Clean reference. As I ponder deeper (and have read some other reviews of this one), I get a sulfuric note which has no place in beer. 		If this is what a TIPA would taste like then I'm not a big fan. The level of hopping is fine and appreciated, it's the fusel alcohol notes that have me put off, but what should I expect from a 12% ale? Yet, in many high ABV beers the alcohol takes on a sherry, cognac, rum or whiskey like flavor...not so here. It just tastes like alcohol...rubbing alcohol. Malts? If you really work at that, they're there. Believe it or not they do supply a weak attempt at a sweetening balance, but they really don't stand a chance. The yeast did too good of a job converting them to C2H5OH. One might think that the yeast performed something akin to alchemy and converted some starches to sulfur as well. But after more contemplation on this one there is a smoky meatiness to it, like a nice barbecue that went unchecked. So I get the sense that we have some roasted malts trying to poke their heads out of the hoppy/alchoholic surface strata...and doing so mostly unsuccessfully, but enough to warrant a slightly higher rating in the taste element.		Yeah, this has a major ""burn"" from the alcohol. Perhaps the largest sense of alcohol I have ever experienced in a beer and I've had a few at 18% and above. It overshadows all the other elements, but since this is dubbed a ""Triple IPA"" I'm guessing that that is the point. I am so afraid to breathe too close to an open flame right now. The bitterness is pretty high as well and that remains in the aftertaste with the pine and still some of the astringency of a cleanser. Good luck getting the flavor off your tongue as the aftertaste will overpower a good dose of Colgate.		I certainly hope that the point of this beer was to produce something over the top and unable to be categorized as this is not something this all that enjoyable to drink. It reminds me of my experiences with DFH World Wide Stout. Point made! Please get back to the wonderful beers that can be palated."
"Tasted On-Tap 10/01/05 at the CBC in Cambridge, MA.		Hazy golden color with an off-white ringed head. Flowery perfumey Heather aroma and flavor with the flavor being a bit soapy ... like one of those fancy soaps... maybe the lavender. Light-medium bodied and lightly creamy. One was enough..		Not bad and worth a try but this just must not be my style ...		Per CBC website:	Release Date: 22 August, 2005. 	Brewed with imported Scottish floor-malted barley, fresh, hand-harvested heather flowers were added to the kettle during the boil along with sweet gale and lavender, with a further addition of fresh heather and yarrow to the conditioning tanks. 	OG: 1.049 FG: 1.012 ABV: 5.0%"
"from the ""dugout"" 12 pack, best by 6/30/6		eyes...	very active head that starts off one full finger and crackles to dissapation rather quickly, very actiuvely carbonated all around, dark honey colored, not bad, pretty average...		nose...	butterscotch from the ringwood yeast dominates (like mst of their beers it seems...), slight dry metallic twinge also in there, not much else aside from a subtle roast malt tone... a bit weak.		taste etc...	leaves a very dry mouth, a touch watery on the mouth feel, the carbonation is prickly and good.. the flavor is a bit watery at times and is dominated by the ringwood here... to a detriment in my opinion. it's just too much here. there isnt much to this one...		verdict?	this one is borderline crap... at least this bottle, it doesnt taste ""bad"" perse but nothing here makes me want to revisit it..."
"Enjoyed on tap at the mothership in Grand Rapids.		Pours amber with ruby highlights and minimal head.		The smell is worth lingering over: bourbon, vanilla and caramel hit you all at once. Love the smell, but it foreshadows the booziness to come...		The beer tastes like a bourbon cocktail: strong bourbon and vanilla characteristics overlay a thickly sweet maple flavor all preceding a very boozy finish that's a bit of a mess. Don't get me wrong: I love bourbon, and I usually look at barrels the way I view bacon and deep frying (it makes everything better). What I'm disappointed by is that, unlike most of Founders' stuff, the flavors from the barrel aging are very blunt and don't let the characteristics of the base beer through. IMHO, barrel aging should accentuate a beer rather than overwhelm it. Here, I don't believe the barrel has done Curmudgeon any favors; the parent beer is almost unrecognizable. I'd say that aging might help this out over time, but since it's not bottled, that option is off the table for now. A rare miss from a very strong brewery."
"Rather than being 'the vagrant's choice', it looks like St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor is 'the rapper's choice'. Instead of including lyrics from any number of rap songs that mention this refined brew (I stopped counting at 30), I've decided to try my hand at a few lines at the end of the review. The question that Malt Likkapalooza VIII has been designed to answer is this: which one of these high gravity lagers is the 'craft beer drinker's choice'? 		Dark amber topped by a French vanilla colored head of impressively rich foam. I'm not sure I want to know how the brewers produce such a good looking lid on such a cheap, high-ABV beer. Of course 99.9% of the people who drink this stuff will never see it anyway. It's even laying down a fair amount of sudsy lace.		The nose is pretty standard for the style, with almost no nastiness. It's sweet and corny and very mildly musky. I can tell there's alcohol present, but it's masked exceptionally well. And the lead widens...		This may be the fruitiest American malt liquor that I've had yet. I got a hint of it in the nose, but it really comes to life on the taste buds. Yeah, it's sweet. Yeah, it's simple. Yeah, it's potent. It's malt liquor! Were you expecting Duvel? Only on the finish is there any hint of a turn for the worse. My advice, as always, is to keep it cold for as long as possible and you'll be fine. A few of these in rapid succession and you'll be more than fine.		I hate trying to come with anything useful to say about the mouthfeel on a malt liquor. This one is competent enough, I suppose. It isn't the least bit watery, nor is it thick and sticky. Actually, it's probably just right for the reason this beer is brewed in the first place: it doesn't get in the way, but still gives you something to chew on.		St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor beats on Evil Eye Ice like a drum; from top to bottom, from back to front and from side to side. This is one of the most lopsided Malt Likkapaloozas in recent memory. I'm a little woozy right now, but here goes...		'this juice is da bomb, yo	i'm buzzin' like a beehive	chillin' it, swillin' it	i love it when the mic's live		'cause i be shoutin' it, toutin' it	to any who will listen	double fisted forties	and your brain be sizzlin'"
"Good stout appearance, but that's about the end of it.		Really sour, pukey sort of smell. The malts and hops are overwhelmed by a very sour presence. For a smoked beer, there is no smokiness whatsoever.		The taste is the same -very sour. I really can't get much more out of this. Really not that good.		This could be better - but the flavour and scent just stop this from being anything better."
"500 ml bottle		Pours light golden with a thin head that almost immediately becomes patchy.		The smell is of sweet graininess and alcohol esters.		The taste is sweet grains and husk. Imbalanced raw alcohol is too noticeable, though not too burning. Alcohol lends little in the way of fruitiness or spice. Sort of just lingers there in a raw way. The malt comes through, but hops are nearly undetectable. They are watered-down/bland.		It seems a bit dilated by water, though there is something of a body there. Some sweetness sticks around.		This is a bit of a chore to drink as there is little in the way of flavor, other than some husky, sweet graininess. The alcohol gives it a rather raw character. I aassume that the medals on the label are for the brewery as a whole.and not for this particular beer, though you never know."
Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a pint glass, the beer is a dark copper-brown coloring with a pale yellow head that quickly disappears. The beer's smells are a blend of heavy malt and caramel notes with fruity highlights, both adding to make a very sweet nose. The taste is rather surprising given the nose. The beer is a sour malt forward flavor, with some extremely bitter hopped highlights. The beer tried to be smooth in mouth, but just ends up being akward and sharp. The sourness and the sharp/crisp finish make this very difficult to drink. Sour malt aftertaste. Not pleasant.
"This can of beer was produced in Denmark, then it was exported to a German border shop. After that, it was bought through a mail-order firm and transported some 700 kilometres north (the last step might or might not be illegal). All in the name of tax optimization. What is worse, some of the Swedish breweries are exporting and re-importing beer this way. 		This way, the price gets low; a crate of 24 cans of 33 cl beer is round $9. If one should have bought the same type of beer at the Swedish alcohol retailing monopoly, the cost would rise by approximately $20.		Ah well. The colour of the beer is deep yellow; the head is finger thick, white and quite compact with some lacing. 		The smell is sour with flavours of nutty malt and some honey. It is a chemical/artificial smell. 		A malty note dominates the simple taste with some notes of sweet bread. The aftertaste is chemical somewhat bitter with a slight roasted note and a touch of wheat bread. 		The carbonation is, in all ways, average. 		A dull beer at a low price."
"This is a cheesy beer from the word go. Labels designed by some guy having a mid-life crisis fantasy (part of a series of three or four, I forget).		Smells of sweet malt and old veggies, a quite unpleasant combination. Thin, vegetal, caramel and fruit. A hopeless melange off just-off flavours.		Copper orange pour with a moderate head that immediately dissapates. Loks average, everything else below par. Feh. Save your money, give it a pass."
"Yeah, seriously.		Pours pale, almost colorless gold with a finger of head. I think my glassware is helping it out here. Lacing is minimal (but not entirely nonexistent.)		The aroma is Pilsen malt, a little sulfurous, but it doesn't smell like corn chips the way some beers do. Maybe a little Saaz hops-- or maybe I'm giving these guys too much credit. Still, it's a Euro lager, so I could be right.		The flavor profile consists of a 0.1% suspension of Pilsen malt in water. No Saaz. No nothing. Except water, with this obnoxious beer taste that makes it harder to drink.		The mouthfeel is like flat seltzer, or slightly fizzy water.		Drinkable but pretty insipid."
"from a growler at the the Rozi's Founders event.		Looks good - yellow straw color, no hint of the impending destruction of my palette yet.		Smells mild, no discernible hops or malt. Touch of habenero.		Taste is good for what it is - not my thang, but a pepper-forward beer that delivers unapologetic heat.		Mouth is actually great, a bit fizzy for some effervescent cool from the pepper inferno.		Drinkability suffers b/c I didn't want another 4oz pour, let alone a pint."
Pours a mostly clear copper-gold with a weak head even on a hard, hard pour. Light raw maltiness and some generic fruitiness and hints of honey in the nose. From fruit, some hops some toasty grain - not a whole lot of anything. Maybe a bit of a woody touch, but I wouldn't pick out cedar if I didn't know it was supposed to be here. Kinda sweet and kinda bland and not particularly interesting. Kinda gimmicky and not something I care to revisit.
"I'm a bit disappointed in this Octoberfest. It just doesn't have the caramel maltiness, the medium body, the sweetness, and the creaminess to be a representative beer of the style. The pour is amber with a nice white creamy head, retention, and lacing. The aroma is a bit off. It starts out a bit skunky, a bit too much sulfer, and then settles down into a very lagery type grainy smell. Not bad, once things settle. 		The taste is just not enough caramel, too pungent, some biting hops on the back end, and a bit too watery for the style. This is one of my lest favorite Octoberfest beers. There is a bit of a sulfery and slightly metallic taste in the finish as well. The tea like hop bite in the finish is the deal breaker for me. The hops or whatever is going on in this beer are just biting, without being nice and bittering. The creaminess in the head just isn't there in the taste. The metallic sulfery taste lingers into the aftertaste and makes it a not so pleasant experience."
"A: Straw with barely a head.		S: Sweet lager smell, mass produced corn and vegetable odor.		T: Grain with some slight malt. Hop bitterness is more than with your typical light. Finishes clean.		M: Water like.		O: I wasn't a big fan of it, especially at the price. I've had domestic lights that were half the price and twice as good."
Served from bottle into Duvel tulip. Pours a hazy almost amber with a one finger off-white head that subsides slowly. It maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of hops, malt, and pine. The flavor is of malt with a massive hop and alcohol followthrough. It is heavy on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this is definitely a sipper. For this high of an alcohol content it is not overly strong but the presence is definitely there. Worth seeking out for any hop-head out there, but don't suggest drinking more than 3-4 if you want to drink anything else and be able to identify flavors of it.
Drainpour, bought in Cleveland. Pours dark with faint beads of a head. Malty, raisin and chocolate aroma, and some coca cola. The taste is chcooalte and mollasses, didn't work for me. Middling mouthfeel. Weak for the style. Didn't feel like 10% but some alcohol warming.
"Pours a mild amber/golden color with a one-finger head into my glass. A bit lighter than I expected but good presentation.		Aroma is full of a gentle hint of peak smokiness and sweet malt with a raisin-like essence. Not bad to start with.		Taste is kind of sour (?) with only a hint of smokiness and sweet malt. Raisin is still here but I can't get over the sourness. I don't think this style is supposed to be anywhere near sour. 		Mouthfeel is full of lingering sourness/smokiness and not much else. Again, very disappointing.		I certainly hope this is just a bad bottle but I'm not one to waste beer. It could be many things but this style is most certainly not supposed to be sour."
"I recently bought a case of Harbour Gold, and was quite impressed with that beer, so I figured I would give this one a shot. I haven't had any other beer from this brewer		650 ml bottle purchased from the LCBO		The beer to me tasted sour. I think something went wrong with this bottle somewhere along the line. 		I tried to taste past the sourness and get to the underlying character of the beer, but ultimately after a few sips it was a drain pour. I think that there was potential in there somewhere.		Hopefully they can get this cleared up. I would like to see some smaller Canadian Brewers doing well."
"A - Poured a beautiful light copper color, good clarity, with a frothy head, that tended to die off after a couple seconds..		S - Dominated by a grassy hop aroma, this is then backed by a slight citrus hop aroma, and some hints of malty sweetness. 		T - The grassy hop flavor overpowers the citrus/flower flavors of the hops. There is a slight malty sweetness that provides good balance to the hops.		M - Moderate body and carbonation fit this beer well.		I was not impressed with this beer, the hops were way too grassy and overpowered all the other flavors."
Pours an amber color with a nice and frothy white head that leaves good lacing. Aromas of caramel and toasted bread, along with hay and a nuttiness, fruity esters, and belgian yeast. The flavor is spicy with notes of rye and white pepper, along with some biscuit and caramel, fruity esters, toffee, pear and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is sharp and drinkability is limited. This one is pretty rough around the edges, with an intense spiciness.
"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass.		A: Hazy, light amber color with lopsided off-white foam residue. Scant lacing remains on the glass and suspended sediment is heavy to the point of being distracting.		S: Light caramel and a trace of herbaceous and piney hops make for a smell that is unremarkable, considering the style, yet inoffensive. No alcohol is detected.		T: Begins off-dry, with early artificial pine hop aromatics, muted butterscotch, and husky crystal malt that is backed by mild acidity. Flavors turn earthy in the middle, intensely English in the qualities presented by the hops, but a bit reckless. Columbus hop flavors become aggressive in the finish--very bitter with medicinal overtones that are not helped either by some late booziness that is present.		M: Medium viscosity, while it is astringent on the palate it stops short of disaster, with low carbonation.		D/O: Another kitchen-sink DIPA that embraces a more-must-be-better philosophy but comes across as muddled at best. Lingering astringent bitterness wrecks the palate, but no payoff is provided."
"Bottle obtained from Breeze-Thru Liquor in Milwaukee.		Appeareance was an orange-ish, hazy beer with a light-colored head with decent staying power. There was a large amount of sediment in the bottle.		Odor was not very appealing. It was a taste of spices (the usual suspects when talking about pumpkin pie or pumpkin beer) layered atop something vaguely unpleasant.		Taste was spice atop a sour taste. Actually, pretty pleasant. I enjoyed the sour-spice relationship more, the more I drank, although I didn't especially want another one. A large amount of sediment was also left in the bottom of my glass."
Thanks to dispholidus1 who shared this with me. Bottle cellared for 4-6 months. Poured dark and kind of thin looking...white head that looks strange on what should be a thick stout. Doesn't smell great....not much there and what is there is really just a ghost of what i was expecting. weak bourbon/alcohol odor. Weak watery flavor. some oak barrel and malt notes...very little bourbon. kind of a coca-cola taste. all very weak...weak is the magic word for this one. really not a great stout.
"Here we have Founder's Breakfast Stout. It comes in these stubby 12 oz. bottles with a label portraying an equally stubby child scarfing down breakfast in some Rockwell-like painting. The beer is pegged as a ""double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout."" What a mouthful! 		I turn up some Aphex Twin and pour my beer into a Founder's pint glass, noticing the very dark brown liquid as the bottle empties. The head takes a few seconds to settle down, finally culminating in a tight, two fingers worth of mocha-colored head sitting on a black stout body. The head surprisingly drops to a thing lace rather quickly, though it looks like it will be leaving a fine lace. Alas, by the end of the glass, there is very little trace of a head anywhere. 		The strongest point of this beer, in my opinion, is the bouquet. ""Huge"" is one word to describe it. Immediately, there is coffee. It is very obvious and it stands out among the other aromas. But this smell is no ordinary coffee bean. We are talking about the aroma of a deeply roasted, rich and earthy coffee bean from Kona! I find it pleasant, while I can see this turning a lot of people off. Not surprisingly, under that aroma is a substantial dark chocolate smell, with the whole acrid 70% cacao thing going on for it. Semi-sweet raisin is there tucked underneath all this; and while I myself cannot pick out an ""oatmeal"" aroma per se, I would say that the smell is quite reminiscent of Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout, with an injection of coffee and chocolate. So I guess what I am saying is that this smells EXACTLY like a double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout!		The flavor profile is again dominated by coffee. This isn't Folgers coffee. This is serious coffee that is full-bodied and rich. Earthy and acidic. Oily mouthfeel. There are slight hop flavors, seen largely in the aftertaste. Occasionally, I thought I could taste sweet notes of chocolate, but now I think I may have been fooling myself. This is coffee beer, folks! If you don't like coffee, stay the hell away. I do like coffee personally, but I also wish that they would pull back on the coffee addition so that the chocolate and hops could shine through a bit more.		The carbonation is fairly intense and the mouthfeel is definitely full-bodied. It is almost to the point of being syrupy, but the sharp carbonation keeps it all in check. I harp here though because I think this beer is missing that signature oatmeal smoothness. 		With all that being said, I think the drinkability factor is pretty piss poor. I would definitely have this again, and I think it would make for a good after dinner drink, you know, instead of coffee. But for breakfast? I dunno...I wanted to try, but I couldn't bring myself to do it ever. Also, I don't think this is much of a beer to drink multiple of in one sitting. Hence the low ""drink"" marks. Definitely worth a shot though if you see it around."
"pours as your typical stout does with slightly more head. Black liquid, tan foam. 		I was taken aback by the heavy brown sugar character that overpowers chocolate and bourbon. Some dark fruit there also. 		This one is pretty light on the bourbon and unfortunately there aren't many other robust characteristics to back this up. Vanilla and dark fruits are here. 		Mouth is med thick bodied and med carbonation. A bit too much carbonation. 		I wouldn't have this one again. While it is an easily available ba stout, it's worth the extra effort to get a kbs."
"Cerise is a deep red color, very beautiful. Mild white foam and minimal lacing.		It definitely smells like cerries, but the main profile is all sweet. I was initially worried it'd be overly sweet like a Lindemans Framboise or something.		The taste is sweet, but more tart than the smell let on. The flavor reminded me a lot of Dogfish Head Fort (without all the booze).		Mouthfeel is tart cherries prickling the tongue, a little sour pucker in the glands, and the beer finishes very dry.		Drinkability suffers due to the sweetness and pucker factor. While I really enjoyed this glass I wouldn't ask for two in a row."
"Okocim beer.	500 ml bottle.	alc. 5.8%		Appearance- yellowish/orange with a thick white head. head held up and laced the glass!	Smell- faint malt, and typical cheap corn macro lager aroma.	Taste- too watery. maybe a drop of malt. sweet. I might detect some cloves here?!	mouthfeel- watery with a yuk aftertaste.		Overall- yet another bad tasting Polish beer. Do not purchase this Keystone Light knockoff!"
"O'Fallon Gold pours a lofty head that collapses quickly over a clear amber brew.	Carbonation is pretty sedate, and the nose is lager yeast and malt. The flavor is 	light barley malt up front with a hint of some kind of hop in the finish. Barley grain	in the aftertaste. Might have been interesting if it was hopped a bit more. Got it 'cause	it was part of a variety pack. You win some, you lose some. Not competent enough."
"A- Has a great slightly dark amber color that is quite clear	S- Smells slightly nutty/caramel 	T- Taste is unique and has a slightly hopy flavor. 	M- Mouth feel is slightly thicker 	D- Drinkability is low because of the unusual flavor and aroma		I cant quite put my finger on the taste of this beer but either the lines need to be cleaned on the tap or it has gone bad. If I try it in the bottle I might change my tune."
"Very golden brassy color and has a fizzy carbonation so didn't really develop or hold a head and no real lace...	smell is nothing really special but had a sharpness that is reminiscent of a skunky like flower...	the taste is a lot like other Czech beers in the floral beers...	the texture is a-lot like other pilsners nothing outstanding... 	Overall it wasn't that exciting to drink but was interesting never the less."
"Appearance: Delicately hazed, deep amber-hued body with a light, tight, white head.		Smell: AA smells of processed ginger, spruce-scented votives, and tangy, smokey blackstrap molasses.		Taste: Initial slip of tartness and a curious taste of gamey smoked meat glazed with molasses and sorghum. Some perceived 'heat' from powderized ginger and a touch of spicy spruce. Sweetish, gingery finish.		Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium-low carbonation.		Drinkability: It's the beer I was most looking forward to at Craggie and the only one I was dismayed by. An odd, clunky mix of disjointed flavors, though I'll probably revisit this one, in hopes of a better experience."
"Bomber split with the family during a cookout and poured into a cervoise. This brew appears a hazed color of lemonade but with a dark yellow to orange coloration. There is no head formation despite lots of fizz and rising bubbles of carbonation to the surface. A swirl does nothing for the appearance.		The smell of this brew is very fruity with hints of lemon zest and pulp. Tons of fruity sweet indications fill the nose. There is a minor fruity malt or alcohol inclusion through the middle but the lemon remains dominating. As it warms, a light amount of sulfur is evident which mixes with a smell that gets somewhat more like grain but that is stretching it.		The taste of this brew is like lemony candy. It is very sweet with some zest, rinds and pulp addition but without the expected bitterness associated with that arrangement of ingredients. Very candy-like across the board like lemon and a bit of limes and a touch of orange. Despite the brew warming up, it doesn't have any more depth of flavor beyond that which has already been described.		This is a medium bodied brew with a light to modest amount of carbonation. It is easy drinking initially but it goes downhill fast. This is just overly sweet candy alcohol with almost an oily feel to it. The stage was set perfectly for this brew to be enjoyed. Chilled down appropriately on a hot summer day along the pool, even shared with people who don't necessarily like beer that tastes like beer... Finishing a bomber of this by yourself would be a real task. 4 people had but 4 or 5 ounces and each one struggled to finish off their share. While initially it was an interesting citrus beverage, the drinkability here is among the worst I have had."
"A: Pours a light, brilliantly clear pale yellow color. The medium-sized white head has a foamy texture and a somewhat brief lifespan. There is a respectable smattering of weblike lacing. 		S: The nose is one-dimensionally vegetal, with hints of rough grain husks and lightly herbal/floral hops. A touch metallic as well. 		T: An extremely thin grainy malt presence up front. A definite cooked vegetable flavor is quite apparent, unfortunately. There is a hint of herbal hop bite towards the finish. 		M: Typically thin-bodied. Carbonation lends some crispness, but not enough to really be appealing. A dry finish. 		D: This beer's popularity is about as damning an indictment of the light lager style as I can find. An expensive European import that is sadly lacking flavor, character, or any sense of refreshment."
"Presentation:	500ml bottle poured into 500ml Okocim Pilsner glass.		Pour:	Huge white, sticky head. Good lacing. Nice golden color to the beer. Very clear, obviously filtered.		Smell:	Sweet and malty with a little earthyness. Some hints of citrus.		Taste:	Sweet and malty to start, but subtle and very mellow on the follow through. Hints at some hops to balance it all out, but not as much as to be desired. Alcohol comes through at the end of each sip, but doesn't really detract away from the brew.		Overall, this is a decent strong lager and worth a try if you like the style. Personally, I really prefer the Okocim ""OK"" Beer, which this beer seems to try and emulate but with more of a kick. The kick is there, but the OK has more flavor and is far more quaffable."
"Bottle at Piniavos Alutis in Vilnius. From notes.		A - Poured amber with no head and no visible carbonation. Hazy. 		S - Lot's of berries, grass, and floral notes. Interesting.		T - Berries. Very odd. Like drinking flowers. Medicinal. Almost like a Sahti but with some more malt backbone.		M - Mild tingly carbonation and a sweet finish. Lightish to medium body.		O/D - I can't see myself ever remembering this one in a positive light. It was very different but not my thing. One was good enough and I didn't find it to be that satisfying. Different but lacking. I didn't want more."
"a- pours a light rusty amber. a bit hazier than it seems it should be. the bit of off-white head that was produced didn't stick around very long and reduced to a very thing film and collar.		s- a big caramel malt presence mixes with a rather unpleasant slightly sour spiciness I'm guessing is from the rye. maybe some grassy/earthy tones in there but that's almost stretching for something.		t- the caramel is still the main part of the show. the slightly sour qualities have subdued and the slight spice from the rye is left. stays on the sweet side though there is fairly good bitternes balancing the sweetness. bready qualities mix into the finish.		m- light-medium body with good QC in the carbonation department. nothing really standout but nothing wrong here either.		d- I'm glad this bottle was free and I'm definitely not encouraged to pick up a 6er of this one. It's a unique take on an Amber ale but misses the mark for my tastes."
"This ""heavenly"" beer from the oldest monastery brewery in the world is generally given high praise amongst many beer aficionados. But that may not mean it's really going to be your cup of tea. 		It pours a dark brown. There's some reddish highlights but I would not call it a good looking brew. The head dissapates quickly, there's no lacing and a tiny ring of foam is all that remains to remind you the beer has any life to it at all. 		The smell is primarily of raisins, figs and other malted sweetness. It's neither bad, nor good.. it just is. And the taste has the same mannerisms.. lots of malted sweetness initially and carrying through towards the end with a small amount of hops to balance it out. There's little complexity to be had and while it's not off putting you probably won't be gulping it down either. 		The mouth-feel as a whole is fairly soft and average. Carbonation is very low. Drinkability, at least for me, scores low. The beer is sipper - and I enjoy plenty of those - but this one doesn't have enough to offer to make me consider having another. In the end, there's nothing really to figure out.. it's just sip upon sip of dark fruit."
"Poured from a brown 12oz twist off into an oversized snifter. A rigerous pour produces a smallish half inch white head. 	The look is an unfiltered hazyness with a glowing darker golden color. Retention is nice at a cap, with sticky lace drapeage.		Aroma is average, its malty and bread filled, but hops are really subdued. fruity with banana, some mild spicie hops, just a distant wiff of grapefruit.		A bit hot upfront, with a lingering solvent flavor, somwhat masked by mild hops. More spicieness, somthing peppery, dry pine, aspirin chalky tones.	Finishing pretty dry with aspirin and bitter hops. More solvent lingering into the finish.		Mouthfeel is tacky and slick, with carbonation abundance. 		I'm dissapointed by this one, after reading some of the reviews on here I had high hopes. 	This is the first Founder's beer I've had that I disliked. Its no biggie, this one is just not for my. Luckily they have a bunch of other kick ass brews out there to drink.		Thanks for finally coming to Minnesota!"
"A--Apple juice in color and clarity. Lots of carbonation, but not a ton of head. Keg draft head retention.		S--Soft, sweet apple. Malty sweetness. Mild spices		T--Strong and astringent! 9.5% ABV doesn't hide itself. Buttery sourdough then mildly metallic, quickly followed by bitter. Bitter and medicinal...that part really holds on. Ugh. Fortunately, aftertaste returns to mercifully bland.		M--Medicinal. A bit oily/slick.		D--I'll pass. Ok...maybe as a mid-party 3am desperation beer."
Super sweet maple nose...one could also detect vanilla...This offering from the geniuses at Founders is extremely too sweet. I can only enjoy 1 glass. This strong brown ale with a heavy mouthfeel poured without a head, almost syrupy. If the maple barrels they aged it in weren't so sweet, this could be a better brew without the overkill sweetness.
"Another recent BBQ beer..No, I didn't buy it. Anyway, It would have been inconvenient to go in the house to get a glass for this so off came the cap and I take a slug....I don't know if it was skunked or not but it had the sharp taste I remember beer having when I was a kid and dad gave me a sip of the beer he'd have once every blue moon. 		Looked pale and basic. Thin and watery with lots of bubbles.		 I really can't call this anything better than just something to drink when you invite non B.A.'s over and they decide to ""bring beer"".		Also not really bad as an after mowing the grass beer to cool off. At least you won't get too buzzed from it."
"A: Poured a hazy amber color with a nice white cap		S: Faded piney hops, caramel		T: Caramel and faded hops battle for dominance while the metallic and old Earthy notes fight for second place. Bad.		M: Medium to full body and not one I would recommend hiolding on your palate		O: Poor IPA, drainpoured after two sips"
"Pours a deep ruddy amber without filtration. This bottle sat for three days in the fridge and it is still very cloudy. Head is light caramel in color with a short life and little persistent lace.		The aroma is wild: overoaked, over bourboned, malty, wheaty sweetness with a touch of fresh morning urine. Where is the piss coming from and why won't it leave?		The beer is large, sweet and boozy with an oakiness that would make a late 90's Cali-Chardonnay jealous. This is an oak bomb!	Butter, Bourbon and a sweet malty mess.		Mouthfeel: Well, for a 9.3% beer, I would understand sweet, but everything about this beer is over the top. Bittering hops perform like an underly confident supporting actor in the middle school production. They try, but they cannot step up to the immensly expulsive and overconfident quickly maturing and painfully overcompensating female lead(s). 		After 20 min of swirling and smelling the urine is beginning to subside but the bourbon sweetness is increasing.		Edit: I stopped swirling for two minutes and the urine is back."
I didnt get a chance to try this beer while at the brewpub a few months ago,to be honest I wish I hadnt picked up the growler today.Poured a murky burnt orange with no head to speak of,looked flat.Ginger and more ginger in the nose,the molasses shows itself as well.Flavors of industrial cleaner smacked my taste buds,the raw ginger flavors were just harsh and really didnt let any other flavors come thru,the spruce tips lent a herbal note to the finish but it just was a bit unpleasant.I hate to give this beer such a harsh review,the other beers I had at the brewpub were well made and enjoyable,but this was just harsh.
Pours a clear orange/brown, big off white head, sticky lace all over the glass. Smell is citrus, bread, some grains, sharp iron aroma, and pineapple. Taste is malty and citrusy at first, some floral, iron and light bitterness. MOuthfeel is light bodied, low carbonation, watery and unpleasant. I haven't really found an English ale I like much, evidently because of the water.
Sampled at the Harmon Brewery. This one was fairly think, clear, and black with a lot of slightly burnt coffee in the flavor, with a hint of toffee. It has a mild coffee aroma and a slightly bitter aftertaste. It was a little disappointing but not bad.
"Another junior high school chemistry experiment. It does have a lot of rich malt and plenty of sugar. Unidentifiable fruit going bad is next. Then the hops start in. Quite a bewildering smorgasbord of hop flavors but the bitterness prevents any real tasting. Very acidic. Aftertaste is like canned grapefruit juice left in the refrigerator. Woody, teeth-on-edge harshness. Orange amber color is fine.		I just don't see the point in this exercise. Seems like a waste of so many hops, but let's support our farmers."
"Hoppin' to Heaven IPA from Hoppin' Frog poured auburn tinted, clean and clear with a short, creamy, white head with good lacing. Aroma had notes of grapefruit, pine, and a whif of fresh cut grass. Flavor had a little sweetness, solid bitterness, some pineapple and a bit of herbs. The body was in the medium-light range with medium carbonation and a dry finish.		Overall this was a pretty solid IPA. The bitterness was a little too sharp for my taste, and the finish was a bit too dry, but that's all pretty minor."
"I've been sitting on this one for a couple months because I was hoping to share the bomber - the tauted 168 ibus seemed a little scary to attempt on my own. Flash forward to tonight: I really want a beer and no one to drink with - let's crack the Mean Manalishi and see what happens...		Looks absolutely amazing - everything you'd want out of a strong Midwest IIPA: Nice dark amber, almost red color. Excellent rolling foam off-white head. Leaves intermittent thick and sticky lace.		Smells of hops alright: bitter and piney, very earthy, smells just like the Ahtanum hop pellets I threw in to dry hop my homebrew tonight.		The taste is full of plenty of hop bitterness. At times it can be overbearing, and at others I am wondering where all 168 ibus went. Slightly sweet and boozy.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly carbonated. Cloying and sticky.		Drinkability suffers because the bitterness gets out of control the more you get through the bottle. Beers like this make me wish HF sold 12oz bottles as well, as that would have been the perfect portion."
1 pint .9 oz bottle. Aroma is grains/grass, metal and rust. The body continues the rust theme and has a rusty river water appearance, but holds a commendable thumb thick white head that is fluffy and lasting. Fore is light and flavorless. Caramel malt flavors in the middle with a mild sweetness and very slightly hoppy finish. Better than many pale Euroe lagers Ive had, but that isnt saying very much.
"Pours with enormous head and nice lacing. Body is a deep orange. Floral hop aroma, slight diaceytal and malt.		 Tastes hollow. Oh sure, it's hoppy, but it is kinda bland. Floral hops, no noticeable malt. Thin mouthfeel, I'm dumping the rest of this bottle."
"Poured from the bottle into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass.		A - Dark brown on the edges black in the center body with a small white head that quickly ran away		S - Sweet citrus hop flavor with a big malty aroma		T - Big citrusy hop flavor with a huge sweet malty backbone. Not really picking up on any specific malt notes, maybe a little roast. A bit of a boozy flavor as well. Finishes with a mixture of bitter hops and coffee.		M - heavy body, very little carbonation, syrupy texture as well.		D - A bit too hot. This thing definitely needs some time to mellow out. I think I'll wait a good while before opening any of the other bottles of this monster."
"At first glance, my label is new and improved. Plus the alcohol has been upped to 10.2%.		Appearance: This beer is just like the backwoods, dark and hazy. A rich dark brown allowing very little light to pass. A generous amount of particulates suspended under a disappointing head.		Smell: Caramel and roasted malts with undertones of ripened fruit. The whiskey backbone of this ale can't be missed.		Taste: The bourbon is first and foremost. More of a bourbon flavor than I would ever want in my beer. Don't get me wrong, I love bourbon but craving a beer and wanting a whiskey drink are two completely different mindsets. The alcohol warming sensation will not go unnoticed. 		Mouthfeel: The ""whiskey punch"" immediately rushes under my tongue to the back corners of my mouth, creating almost a tart reaction from my tastebuds. 		Drinkability: Unfortunately I could only drink one of these at this sitting. I am thinking I will save the rest for a night that I am wanting something a little strong, like a drink of whiskey."
"12oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.		A: A slow, straight, high pour yields a hazy, dark reddish-amber body with a finger and a half of nicely persistent white foam. Maybe not a great-looking DIPA, but definitely a great-looking 12% beer.		S: Very Barleywinish here, with sweet, toasty, caramelized malt underlying a huge wave of candied-grapefruit hoppiness. Lots of everything, but far too sweet for my tastes.		T: Starts out with a hop bite, but quickly melts into a cascade of rich caramel malt. The sweetness seems to last forever, but is finally overcome by a stunningly bitter finish. Plenty of booze on the aftertaste, but less than I'd expect from 12%. Absolutely huge, and fairly well-integrated - for an American Barleywine, that is.		M: Full, viscous body with plenty of fine, soft carbonation. Extremely sticky, but otherwise lovely.		D: It's not too bad for the strength and intensity, but it just can't get high marks for the style. Way, way to sweet for a standard DIPA - even too sweet for a TIPA if you ask me. Now, if this were classified as an American Barleywine, I'd give it significantly higher marks - it's very tasty.		Notes: Whoa, Nelly. I expected this to be huge, and it did not disappoint. I was hoping for a more distinct, complex hop presence, but the interplay of gigantic sweetness and equally gigantic bitterness was more than enough to keep me interested. Memorable beer.		Cheers!"
Served in the new Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a hazy orange/gold color with a very small white head. It smells mainly like cloves, pepper and banana, but the aroma isn't very strong at all. The taste is mostly cloves, but there's also some yeast, lemon, pepper and banana too. However, it finishes with a slight astringent, almost soapy taste that isn't pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit dry. Drinkability isn't too good, the astringent/soapy finish ruins the beer for me. It was pretty hard to finish the whole bottle. I'll have to revisit this one in the future, but this bottle wasn't good at all.
"Appearance	Foamy white head forms agressively up to 4 fingers but doesn't stick around. Hazy lemon body.		Aroma	Peaches and white grape. Smells like the sparkling peach fizz drink my younger brother is still fond of. Not objectionable (I like peaches!) but nothing really to it otherwise.		Taste	Peach is there but not very citrusy (I'm chalking the bite completely up to carbonation on this one). Imagine is you bit into a peach without that sharp acidic bite and were just left with a really dull flavor. Bananas in the aftertaste. Hops? Nope. No real balance here.		Mouthfeel	Carbonation shows up in the beginning, apparently doesn't like what it sees and leaves with little fanfare. Medium body. Viscosity lingers around with a sort of muted clovey taste that isn't quite appreciated.		Drinkability/Overall Impression	Goes down smooth but I'm drinking to finish the glass, not out of enjoyment. There's not much I like with this brew. I'll stick with Festina Peche as my go to peach beer. I advise others pass on this one, you're not missing anything."
"Hey ho boys and girls!! I've been working third shift, gettin ready to hit the hey and decided to savor my roommates last BBC Dark Star Porter. What's he gonna do? 		Anyway, I like to start with the label and how it presents itself before I even begin the poor. Although the blue and red are a nice combination, the image itself gives me the feel that they rushed the design and simply threw the name on the bottle and drew some arrows as a background trying to give it some kind of sunshine kinda thing. Didn't do it for me. Let's go on to the pour. It's my favorite part...		Now that's a smooth pour!! 	I don't know if it's just my inexperience talking, but it seems to be off on color just a bit than other porter's I've seen. 	The head was fairly thin and uninteresting. 		After about twenty deep inhales, I am coming up with what seems to me a ""choco-coffee"" aroma. That and a head rush from twenty deep inhales. The ""choco"" is fine, but I'm a bit worried about the ""coffee"". Ya see, it's no big secret, but I HATE the flavor of coffee, so I am very uneasy and distraught on the drink I'm about to taste...here goes...		Okay, it wasn't as bad as I feared. Before I comment, one more gulp...okay, I think I got it. Kinda sparkles on my tongue while drinking. Not like a carbonation, but definitly a tingle of something. Maybe 'coarse' is the word I'm looking for.	Across my tongue, it seemed a bit watery, but not bad by any means. 	Looking across at my glass of the almost finished brew, I notice a little lacing. (I just learned what that was yesterday...)	I think where this beer may have gone wrong is in the after taste. A strong burnt after taste that just didn't seem to go away. Normally when I taste a 'burnt' after taste, it goes away rather quickly and almost leaves me with a desire to have another, but not in this case. It hangs on too long for my tastes."
"Appearance- Dark brown with tan one finger head that doesn't last long.		Aroma- Molasses, dark roasted malts and grape juice.		Taste- Sweet, malty, and extremely grapey 		 Feel- Smooth with moderate carbonation		 I really wanted to like this one but it ended up being a little sweet and there was this overpowering grape taste."
"Best by 8/28/06. Enjoyed in a pint glass at just over fridge temperature after dinner on a cool, late Summer evening.		Appearance- Pours a clear gold with orange highlights... nice two-finger head with some webby lacing down the sides of the glass.		Smell- Gargantuan aromas of honey, malts, and a quite pronounced alcohol content. Phenomenally huge nose, it's like staring at a roasted pig on a full stomach. It's not particularly balanced, and seems like a bully on the playground back in fifth grade.		Taste- Rich, sweet maltiness right in the beginning that turns awkwardly to an uber-honey botched orgy... this is a very difficult beer to sit back and enjoy. Heavy-handed and belligerant, it just doesn't have balance. 		Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Sharp and tingly in the mouth... then subsiding slightly, the mouthfeel lumbers through its motions. Unfortunately this beer doesn't recover from the harshness of just about all of its attributes, and I am shocked at the outcome. Either this came from a bad batch or this beer is not what it was two years ago... horrifically disappointing."
"First...I'll say I LOVE Founders. They are one of my 2-3 favorite brewers. I had been looking forward to this one for a long time. Here is the verdict:		A: A nice deep ruby red / dark mahogany. A tan head that disappears quickly.		S: Booze. Deep malt notes.		T: Way too much booze taste here. Beers with higher ABV's have gone down like silk compared to this. Overly malty...but not sweet. The main focus is the ethanol and some other offish taste that I can not quite describe.		M: Alcohol burn predominates.		O: Love Founders...and I really wanted to like the beer. I do not. Glad I got a single and not a sixer. Sadly....a drain pour for me. Just not enjoyable and I would not force myself to finish."
"Appearance - 4.0	Hazy light amber with an off-white head which retains well.		Aroma - 2.0	Cidery, little in the way of malt or hops.		Taste - 2.0	Also rather thin and cidery, low to moderate bitterness with a definite sour note and a very dry finish.		Mouthfeel - 3.5	Light body, moderate to lively carbonation.		Overall - 2.5	It's hard to decide whether the tart, cidery character of this beer is deliberate or an accidental flaw. Either way, not my cup of tea (or pint of ale for that matter)."
"Pours a dark brown color with about one finger of khaki head. Recedes to a thin lace and then disappears completely and doesn't leave a trace - looks like flat soda.		Smell is some caramel and toasted malt, bit of chocolate too. Earthy sort of aroma, as well.		Taste starts off with some quick chocolate sweetness before giving way to an earthy, dirty sort of unpleasant flavor. Not sure what it is but I'm not caring for it. It's bitter and roasted malt flavored but in a bad way. Mouthfeel is pretty crisply carbonated with a medium body.		I do not care for this at all. One of the worst porters (probably the worst actually) I've had. I won't revisit."
"Pours from the bottle the color of, well, take a look at the name. A fizzy white head rises up quickly and sits back down again. Smell of sweet malt and buttery corn. Flavor is light and crisp, some grassy flavors, not too malty and not too hoppy. Mouthfeel is dry and tingly. Not a great beer, but better than most American macro lagers. Or as my wife said ""It's bad beer made better."" I love the other selections from BBC, so it's good to hear that this is contract brewed and not really their own. Thanks to Brent for sending this on and for warning me to not take it too seriously."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, part of the continuing series of mainstream ticks from my parent's house.		Pours a clear golden color with apparent carbonation, the head is a finger and goes away as fast as it comes. Aroma-wise? Not terrible. Water is predominant, but there's some light, sharp hoppiness and some bready malts. The taste? It starts out not too bad, it's fairly flavor deficient but has some nice subtle hop zings over some bready malt, but the finish comes in with a terrible metallic taste that basically ruins the whole thing. As it warms and my pallet becomes adjusted, this just tastes more and more like mineral water.		The mouthfeel is nice, it's well-carbonated and prickly on the mouthfeel. The drinkability isn't great for a light beer, it tastes like it should be a bit heavier in ABV. Overall, this really isn't a great beer. It's servicable, but just barely. If it was the only thing available, I'd drink it and not complain too much. But picking this over the Yuengling and Stella in my parent's fridge was a mistake. Absolutely need a light beer? This is better than many, but seriously? Sam Adams Light or bust. It's bizarre to think that this might be better than most people's experience with this beer, because I took this bottle straight out of an unopened 12 pack."
"Poured from a bottle, dated 09/10, in to a pint glass. Not sure what was going on, but each one of these has foamed up entirely too much. One ended up with about 80% head and a small amount of beer at the bottom. So very annoying to pour. When it settles, the head is cream colored and the body is a amber brown color.		The smell has a sweet malt flavor to it, with some nuttiness. 		I saw another reviewer mention a metallic aftertaste, so I'm glad I'm not alone. There's a sweet nutty flavor to begin with, but that metallic taste I get at the end is a buzzkill.		Despite the crazy head to begin with, the beer doesn't feel overly carbonated. I bought a six pack and am sorta glad that I gave two of them away."
"Into a mug.... big mistake		A = A sharp looking beer. Nice tannish white head that clings a little. But man the color and density is beatiful. Deep garnet color that is fairly opaque.		S = Wow. So subtle. Initially get the resinous hop smell but the alcohol is also there. A slight turn off. Although i love that hop smell the alcohol is overwhelming.		T = The alcohol overwhelms the hops here and its the first taste you get. It lingers forever with the resinous taste. Makes you want to smack your lips but again the alcohol is a bit too much. Well maybe the hops are too much too it burns! haha		M = The resin really makes it feel fuller than it is. 		D = One and done at most. A nine ounce poor would be better."
"650ml bottle &lt;br&gt;	4.5% ABV &lt;br&gt;	I tried this beer on May 28, 2011 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a translucent amber colour with a very thin white ring for a head. The aroma is stale grass, very weak floral hops, and an extremely weak whiff of cherry. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with medium carbonation. Flavour is mainly malt and hops, with a drying bitter finish."
"A: Pale, straw yellow without much head. 		S: Not much to speak of. From what I detect, mainly a random assortment of grains with a touch of grain alcohol, just to spice things up. 		T: Primarily watered down adjunct malts. There's a slight twang of hop bitterness, but the odd effect it creates is very off-putting. It's similar to the bitterness you get if you (somehow) bite into a bar of soap.		M: Crisp and clean; but which macro lager isn't?		D: I found myself having trouble finishing the bottle."
"Boy, one of the *premium* beers on American Airlines. Decent golden yellow filtered pour with a white head that doesnt last long. A small malt aroma can be detected behind a little of the ol European sulfur skunk. Taste is weak, thin, bland, unimpressive  but hey, the can lists; *Full flavor  Low calorie 95, low carb .5*. whoop de doo !! 		Cripe, just drink lemon water and save yourself 95 calories, if that drives your beer choices."
"Purchased single bottle from Martignetti's		Appearance = Nice copper color of a good ale. Excellent head retention. Good 1/2 inch that faded to 1/4 inch and lasted much longer than average		Smell = Floral, carmel hops permeate through. Smells very similar to your atypical quality APA.		Taste = Hmm..I seriously wonder if my bottle from skunked because there's a definitely funky taste mixed in that really doesn't seem right. Starts off great like a grain-toasted carmel, malt well balanced APA but then a nasty funky skunked taste comes through. There's no freshness date on it and Marty's is a high quality place so I don't think it's expired. Perhaps the brewery messed this batch up but regardless, I'm not a fan of this one.		Overall = My review might be seriously flawed if I got a skunked bottle but if not, you can find 100s of APA's that taste a lot better than this one. It still has a great look though, one of the better looking beers I've seen in awhile."
"A: Poured this wheat bear into a Weizen Glass and watched the eggshell white head rise aggressively about two inches with big bubbles at the bottom and fine frothy foam at the top of the head.	S: Smells pretty good with a strong note of honey and yeast, small hint of alcohol present towards the end of the smell. Smells refreshing.	T: Not too much taste here actually has a sorta tinny aftertaste? Wired from a bottle.. Hoppy and not much wheat present. Dry.	M: Very flat, watery and dry.	D: if you want to pound em it will go down like water, and taste like it too! Wont be trying this one again; actually dumping this one down the drain."
Pours a murky dark brown that leaves a thick tan head. The aroma is fruit, prunes, figs, brown sugar, plums very inviting with a suttle hop earthiness. The taste is initally good, toffee a bit of alcohal is just faint enough to be noticed. There is a bitterness for balance, followed by a banana fruit salad feel to this brew. As this beer warms up I get more of an unpleasantness from this offering. It starts to taste like cherry nyquil with the alcohal and fruit feel on the palate. This offering from Founder's gives you a Jekyll and Hyde performance in the beginning it is great but as it warms up the alcohal and off fruit flavors dominate and make this a below average quad.
"My wife picked this up for me... along with 6 or 7 other beers to try... yeah.... she's a keeper!!		Poured into a pint glass to produce a nice 1"" head of off white loose foam.... the beer itself was a clear golden/orange color. The head immediately dwindled to absolutely NOTHING in a couple minutes leaving not a trace of lace on the glass....		The nose was actually rather interesting for this beer. I could pick up a spiciness Like candied cinnemon, that kind of surprised me.... and a bit of a malt back bone. Not too complex.		Taste was... ummmm.... different. I don't think I like this too much. A little spicy.... a little corney.... alcohol is not well hidden.		MF: A little thicker than water... but not nearly as robust as I'd like... but it's a lager, so....		Drinkability: No thanks... I'll choke this one back.... but I'll not be seeking this one out again...."
"Well thankfully everyone else seems to have enjoyed this one. I on the other hand (and everyone one else drinking it with me at the same time), did not. 		Pours nice enough I guess with a clouded gold. Everything is downhill from there. All I get is a burning sensation as if the beer was mixed with rubbing alcohol or some solvent. I guess the barrel is to blame for this, but it is completely abrasive and undrinkable. All DIPA characteristics are also overshadowed by this harsh bite. Hopefully this was just a bad keg, but I waited 15 minutes in line at a bar to get this and there were 7 Founders employees in the house. So there is really no excuse for this one. Atrocious."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip.		The beer pours a murky red, with a thick head.		The aroma is of marijuana: pungent, musky, earthy, and fungal. The aroma is strong, and potent. If someone decided to make a pot beer, this is what it would smell like.		The taste is obliterated by the aroma. It's strong, pungent, vaguely unpleasant, and I can't pick out any specifics because the smell is completely clouding my taste perception. The whole time, I'm thinking ""is this what a pot beer tastes like?"" Regardless, this is one of the worst beers I've ever tasted.		Overall, I think this beer is terrible. It smells like weed, it tastes vaguely foul, kind of how I imagine a pot beer would taste. My taste buds are generally in-sync with the Founders brewers, and I tend to really like their beer, but this brew is awful. I'm going to cellar the other bottle and hope that age managed to work some miracle and redeem this concoction."
"Thanks to Northertimber for this one!		Wow, body is a pretty burnt amber color ... very nice. Head is big like it belongs to Tito Ortiz. 		Hmmm. I have issues with the nose. Does it smell good? Yes. Does it smell like a double IPA? Not at all. The malt is seriously huge and the hops never show up in the ways we expect them to for a double IPA. There's no grapefruit, no pine. Imagine smelling a dried orange coated in sugar ... that's all the hops we get. Just orange and tangerine and that's all. This actually reminds me a lot of Double Bastard ....		Taste is exactly the same way. Nope, this is deinitely NOT an IPA or even double IPA. I love that Stoudt's is giving us a taste of an IPA sans pine and grapefruit but this just doesn't taste like an IPA. If I want a hops fix I would never reach for this beer. Does it taste good though? No, it's delicious ... to bad it's delicious in all the ways an IPA shouldn't be.		I like this a lot, and would definitely buy it if it was sold near me, but not if I was in the mood for an IPA. The brewers should really think about relabeling this one."
I had this beer at the brew pub and was not impressed. I have had alot of different infused beer but this one is by far the worst. I could only take a sip and left it on the table to that everytime a new friend showed up that had to take a sip as a joke. No-one at the table of six enjoyed this brew. I have heard of people that like but I am not one of them.
"Had this on-tap at Northern Light's brewpub in Spokane for $3.25.		Color was a dark brown with a medium sized off-white head. Minimal lacing.		Smell was fairly bland. There was a faint roasted malt smell that reminded me of chocolate. I was sniffing the crap out of this, and I could only pick up that much chocolate. Pretty sad when you consider chocolate was part of the name of this beer. 		Taste was only slightly more chocolatey than the smell. I don't know if this was an ale or a lager (and the service was so bad, I couldn't find out from the server), but this was bland either way. There was an ever-so-slight bitterness and a very slight chocolate sweetness. Besides that, there was nothing. 			The mouthfeel of this beer was like the taste and smell - bland. It wasn't thick at all, but it wasn't thin either, so I guess it belongs in some sort of mouthfeel limbo.		This wasn't a particularly impressive or memorable beer, but I think it was the darkest Northern Lights makes. The more exposure I have to this brewery, the less impressed I am. The crying shame of it is that it is currently the only Spokane microbrewery. I have to expand local to pretty much all of Eastern Washington if I want a decent beer, it seems."
"A-Pours an orange, gold color with 1/8 finger of white head that dissipates very quickly.		S-Sweet and caramel malt notes with no noticeable hop presence.		T-Dry graininess with an almost tannic quality.		M-Pretty much flat in the carbonation department with thin body.		D-It is 99 cents; that being said, this is one I probably won't purchase this one again. My primary objective isn't getting drunk so, if yours is, check this one out."
I'm suprised that some others tasted anything other than the smoke. More overwhelming than I would have thought. I actually bought this thinking it was a regular hefe (although I knew they made the Rauchbier). After a hefe like pour (albeit a dark one) nothing but smoke, smoke, smoke. I liked smoked food, and I would like to try this with a smoked sausage or something. Beyond that, I could think of no other reason to have this again.
Well, after one sip, my initital thought was: this beer is like eating a bowl of cereal. Totally grainy taste. Medium yellow in color, with a slight head. Smell was fresh, but very reminiscent of a grain mill (I used to live on a farm, it was reminded me of the smell of grain). Taste is also reminiscent of refined grain, with some hop bitterness in the finish. Would not have again. pat
"Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a pint glass.		A - Thick, substantial 2-finger beige head that lasts. Dark brown and clear. Very nice first impression.		S - Subtly smoked wet leather with undertones of well-toasted malts.		T - Here's where the smoke really shows up. Smoked and burnt caramel sugars (think an over-charred top of a creme brulee). Smoke dominates throughout and lingers on the finish. Unbalanced - difficult to find anything else in the taste, especially hops.		M - Good carbonation gives it a nicely defined structure that's papered with smoke. Smooth to start with a clean palate on the finish.		D - Smoke really dominates every aspect of this beer. While I enjoy a well-balanced smoked porter like Alaskan, I felt that the malts are too smoked and burnt for a Marzen."
This one pours a light to medium in body, dull and only lightly cloudy gold in color. It has a one finger sudsy white head. It's pretty clear for a German hefe, and disappointingly so. It smells of sweet pale malts, cloves, smells fruity, and wet bread dough. It has the usual adjectives but not the usual effect or appeal. The flavor is of sweet and fruity, almost banana-esque, yeast and spice. It's an odd and awkwardly sweet mix for the style. I'm not really a fan. It drinks light to medium in body and doesn't nearly life up to other authentic German hefes. This one just misses the mark with me.
"appearance - bright straw		smell -- it's got that classic export lager sweet-metal smell, what the heck is that anyway? also it was a bit skunked, a little hay and fresh straw in the nose too.		taste -- coffee like bitters, cover the whole tongue, with a slightly husky/honeyed malt finish -- bitters stay at sides of the tongue.		overall -- not so hot, i'd rather have a Carlsberg."
Didn't work..too watered down and overcarbonated. Looked like an amber rootbeer, and that would be its best plus. Maybe it is? Could not taste anything, and just had a sample of a bottle so know what it could be like. Sweetness, perhaps a tad of hops.
Pours pale golden from the twelve ounce bottle with a rather large, foamy white head. Immediate unmistakable aroma of a cheap euro lager - some pretty pervasive skunkiness. Aroma actually subsides the closer you get to the beer. Seriously foamy body holds a decent flavor of mid-grade Eurpoean lager - clean, with a slight hoppy bite. Not a bad flavor, but the body and smell make this one pretty undesirable.
Pours with a white two-fingered head that fades to clumps and leaves a lot lace. Light, clear amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Lightly hopped mixed with some malt. Not a lot bitterness, seems watery, some sweetness. Brewed by Frederick Brewing for Stoudt. $1.45 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma.
Overpowered by the bourbon taste. Not much carbonation, which could have offset the high ABV. Maybe I got an old bottle, but alcohol burn very present. Can't get past the bourbon taste, both in the initial flavor and aftertaste. Very much like Old Grand Dad. Founders must use some of their bourbon casks in the brewing process.
"Brewed with seven grains and four domestic hop varieties including cascade and glacier.		Pours out to a cloudy burnt orange...unfiltered. Forms a modest white soapy head with average retention and sparse lacing, despite a vigirous pour. Carbonation is moderate. The nose is quite nice with a juicy grapefruit and sweet mango hop quality. Cleanly fermented with no off aromas. Mouthfeel is prickly and acidic with a strong grain and hop astringency and medium body. The flavor is all about the hops. Lots of grapefruit pith and some piney, resinous qualities, with a decent amount of malt body. There is a little bit of mango which is something I really enjoy in my IPA's. The bitterness/sharpness/astringency is a bit much and limits it's drinkability. Aftertaste is quite bitter and the finish is slightly watery.		A decent IPA, but there are so many out there that are better. I have no interest in having this again, because the astringency and bitterness are out of whack, making it not very drinkable."
"Another novelty beer from the 2003 Vermont Brewers Festival.		And this *is* a novel beer. First of all, it's raspberry colored, almost pink, with a pink head. The nose was pure unadulterated raspberry with a very pleasant fruity aroma. Flavor was also rather good, with some nice tart raspberry flavors backed up with a bit of malt, but the finish was rather tannic, bordering on unpleasant. It's not all that drinkable---a small sample was nice, but didn't really leave you wanting more. Fun, and interesting, but not really a beer I'd recommend"
"It took me about 10 minutes to pour the entire bottle into the glass because the head was overflowing everywhere. Once I got it out the bottle the head lasted until I finished drinking the beer, leaving small pieces of tan foam on the sides of the glass. Beer had a strange appearance where it was darker at the top than at the bottom.		Had a strong hop scent to it with a hint of the rye. Was a bit heavy on the carbonation which was not surprising considering the head on this one. Overall had a good flavor. Would consider trying one again."
"12oz bottle purchased as a single from Julio's, Marlboro, MA. 		Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a minimal 1/8"" layer of bubbles over the cloudy orangey amber brew. Head is down to a spotty layer of swirly teeny bubbles almost immediately, with little to no lacing. Aroma is syrupy fermented apples. Taste starts with a quick flash of malty sweetness, quickly overtaken by a strong licorice flavor in the middle, and closes with a powerful shot of alcohol. Mouthfeel is tough to handle, and drinkability is cut short by the burn. Not one I'd go searching out again anytime soon."
Poured all head, standard BMC white. Settled down to a clear standard straw yellow. Smell has a hint of the start of skunking and standard grass and grain. Taste is just a standard BMC despite all the advertising claims that he has so much more flavor than other light beers. The only thing a little stronger than most lights is the bitter finish. So I'd say acceptable if you like standard BMC lights, but that's about it.
"Claims to be a Bourbon Barrel Stout, there are no details on the 4 pack or the bottles		Dark brown body, light tan head that half fizzled out like a soda. Lots of visible carbonation		Smells more like a light chocolate stout, maybe just a hint of bourbon...		Which doesn't follow in the taste. Honestly hard to believe this was barreled aged. Flavor is more like a subtle coffee and chocolate stout. Very tastey, maybe a little weak, but no bourbon. Pretty thin on the mouthfeel. Leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. Highly drinkable, probably not for the right reasons.		This is a very confusing beer because the little information we have from the label was misleading. No clue on the ABV but I would guess it to be on the lower-side"
"Appearance: Nice head. Plenty of visible carbonation. Light lacing. Light copper color. Very clear.		Smell: Smells just like it tastes. Malty, sourdough biscuit aroma.		Taste: Malty, sourdough biscuit flavor. Bitter but no floral hops.		Mouthfeel: Bitter. Nice carbonation. Flavor lingers.		Overall: Disappointing. Where is the floral hop finish? Tastes like an imitation of Heineken. I've been to Germany and tasted real Pilseners. This isn't one of them. That being said, not a bad session beer if you like a bitter lager."
"Comes in a short and stout 33 cl bottle with a stylish label featuring a crab surrounded by hops. Rice is an ingredient. Bottled on 5/4/03, I opened it on 7/27/03.		Pours a clear darkish gold under a thin fizzy head that hits the road quickly, leaving no trace of collar or lace. The nose is powerful, but what is it? Herbs? Thyme? Oregano? Whatever it is, it's not good. The mouth is heavy, flat and metallic. The initial taste is sweet and tinny, wiht that same herbal background. The finish has a decent hoppy bite, but not enough to overcome the metal and the herb. The aftertaste is herbal, like a bad tea."
"Ah yes, as others have said - the Bud of Egypt. However, this Egyptianized Stella and Saqqara Gold are far more available and affordable while in Egypt - considering its a Muslim country and most of the time you can't get alcohol, I guess we were thankfull to have it. In Cairo, you can have it delivered right to your door via scooter, along with a couple of wines and some liquors as well.		The color is pale yellow. For the amount of carbonation in the bottle, it appears quite flat. Taste is watered down with a slight skunky smell. What can be said - this is the industrialized, mass produced, Marxist beer of Egypt. Its cheap, its available, but in the words of Dundee, you can drink it, but it tastes like shit. Other beer varieties are available at tourist restaurants and hotels, but you will pay for them."
"This was one of the closeouts at the Vintage Cellar this month. I think I know why after drinking and reading other's reviews. This must have been sitting around awhile past its prime. 		Pours a clear golden yellow with a short, thin, white bubbly head. The head retains pretty well at a 1/2 finger skim, and it yields light washes of slippery lace with each drink. Light carbonation is seen throughout the beer. 		Aroma is definitely displeasing. Bubblegum meets honey meets spoiled grain. It's sickly sweet, and, while aspects of it aren't that off-style, something's definitely off. 		Taste gives up a lot of lemon and wheat - a very clean and crisp taste. There's a good dose of honey sweetness, slightly cloying, with a hint of that bubblegum from the nose. Crisp green apple finishes the flavors. Well carbonated with a light syrupy film in the finish. 		Drinkability is hard to rate. I can barely get past the nose to the beer, and even when I do, I don't find much worth making the trip for. I'll have to try again when a new shipment comes in and see if it's just me or if it's actually the beer."
I poured this into a tall, slender glass I got from a cafe in Bonn, Germany. I let it go in a bit too hard and got a whole hand's worth of white head. The liquid was translucent with a straw yellow color. All the head laced nicely. It had a dry, lemony aroma. The taste was considerably sour and bitter - too much so. I know I opened this before the date on the bottle, so I'm assuming that it's not gone bad, but this is weird. The bitterness lingers considerably. I can't find any sweetness to offset the bitter. After some time passes, it begins to improve some. It's It feels OK in the mouth, except for the aftertaste. I've enjoyed all of Stoudt's other products, and unless I'm just missing something on the pilsener style, this isn't much fun. Maybe all that head was a sign of a problem. Darn.
"A - Dark brown brew with a finger and a half of dark tan head. Small specks of lacing are everywhere on glass, but they are scatter and practically refuse to clump.		S - Extremely potent coffee. It smells exactly like intense dark roasted coffee beans. It smells like a coffee from a French press. I honestly don't like that smell much (I don't really drink coffee) - and definitely not when it is this pronounced. 		T - The other flavors are completely overshadowed by the dark roasted coffee beans - an espresso-esque flavor. A touch of chocolate and burnt malt. The aftertaste is partially a slightly bitter coffee aftertaste, but mostly the unpleasant chemical aftertaste that I abhor in coffee. There is a bit of bitter burnt malt and even less dark chocolate in the aftertaste as well.		M - Medium viscosity, a tad subpar in smoothness. Not refreshing on the tounge, but it is on the throat.		D - Wow. I can't remember the last time I have been this disappointed by a top rated beer. I can understand why coffee achievers might be enthralled by the beer, but that it not me. A subtle coffee presence is appreciated, but drinking a cold carbonated mocha isn't what I want when I want a stout. The drinkability is pretty bad because the coffee chemical bitterness is relentless - it just never disappears. The mouthfeel isn't helpful - my tounge feels like a raisin."
"i had the sampler at pikes tonight that had this beer...		as small as the sampler was i couldn't finish this beer. 	smell decent. i gave it a higher ranking because I felt a little guilty....		this beer was not high on my ranking. I am not going to rip through it here because that just doesn't seem right.		mouthfeel was carbonization, lots"
Dark orange-bronze color with very little to no head. I see very small floaters lofting around in my glass. Maybe I just grabbed a dirty glass out of the cupboard. Smells good. Like Pumpkin pie. Pumpkins, nutmeg, cloves. The taste isn't too overwhelming. It smells stronger than it tastes. It feels a little watery and flat in the mouth. This is a Thanksgiving/Halloween novelty beer that I could have a couple of during those times of year. But I wouldn't want to drink this beer in any quantity. It's OK.
"Wow, this is definitely an acquired taste! (One that I don't think I'll want to acquire...) If you like hanging out in smokehouses, you might like this beer, but for me, it was like being beaten over the head with the predominant smoke flavor.		It poured a clear dark maroon, with a tan head. Smoke was the main aroma, with a touch of malt sweetness. Tastes were SMOKE, kielbasa, and a wee bit of malt. Mouthfeel was thin and watery. Finish was (surprise, surprise) SMOKE! 		Next time I want a smoked beer, I'll go for the Stone Smoked Porter. This one is more like a liquified smoked sausage, or drinking the water you just put out the campfire with..."
"Thanks to THECPJ for grabbing a bottle of this for me up in Cooperstown.		A: Seemed to pour a little thin, but the color is a very deep brown with a one finger tan head on top. Not much retention with the head settling down to a very thin layer of bubbles. Not much lacing. 		S: A little bit of roasted malt, a hint of chocolate. It has an aroma that remind of me my first homebrew, a little bit of a plastic bucket aroma. 		T: Roasted malt up front with a hint of chocolate, but then the flavor seems to disappear. Slight roast on the finish. 		M: Thin bodied with moderate carbonation. Thinner than I like in a stout, seems a bit watery. 		O: Had some of the right flavor components, and while I applaud CBC for making a nice simple stout, but I would have liked a bit more."
"Consumed at brewery on Saturday, November 5th 2011.		Beer is presented as a hazy medium to dark amber brew with a moderate white head.		Aroma is acetone. Dee-lish!		Flavor is bitter and rusty with some hop-sourced pine as an accent. No malt notes at all.		Mouthfeel is astringent.		In the cornucopia of fail that is this brewery's portfolio, this is one of the worst offenders. Utterly undrinkable."
The aroma is very smokey and covers any other smells that might be there save a hint of malt. The appearance is dark brown and the head is persistent. The flavor is also very smokey and not unlike beef jerky. The palate was not as thick as I wanted but still its not thin. A very unique beer that's a must try, like it or not.
Ringwood yeast and mild hops and light copper colour. Small head. Early session ale. Dry, fair. #9 on-tap at Clark's Ale House in Syracuse. Smooth for a nothing special lager. Not greatest intro to this brewery, but we will at least give it two more strikes..
"Split the bomber with my girlfriend who picked it out because of the roses. 		Pours a clear gold/orange with a small white head.		Smells floral as expected with some malty sweetness too. Not really picking up heavy roses on the nose.		Tastes weirdly floral, but not good floral like a heavily cascade hopped beer. Hardly any hops at all, just a weird rose flavor. Good news is if I ever want this flavor again, I have a large rose bush in my front yard.		Undercarbonation leads to an even worse experience. 		My first drain pour in quite a while. After a few sips these became way too overpowering and going through 22 oz wasn't happening."
"Aroma: Sulphur up front. Light grainy pilsner malt. A hint of herbalness. 		Appearance: Pours thick three finger fluffy white head. Very clear. Light straw color. Dissipates slowly. Low lacing. 		Flavor: Big grainy pils malt flavor. An astringent chalky finish. High bitterness for style. A nasty aftertaste.		Mouthfeel: Crisp, low light mouthfeel. Finish very dry.		Overall: A beautiful looking beer. Great color and clarity. High astringency and chalkiness kills this for me. I don't see me drinking this again."
"Dark amber translucent appearance with a quickly dissipating head. Aroma is dosage of floral hops with a hint of malt sweetness. Nothing too special. Palate is rather unimpressive. Some malt sweetness in the middle and a little hop bitterness, but nothing stands out at all. Very basic. Mouthfeel is light, effervesant and watery. Just a very sub-par beer all around. Reminds me of a macro attempting to make a micro. I won't be back for another. 		Disclaimer: This is not a style I am well versed in, and I typically drink fairly big beers."
"A bomber poured in flared glass.		A: cloudy orange color; abundant head, good carbonation; lacing nice	S: booming roses and hops	T: bitter and very hoppy--so hoppy it's soapy tasting; pine taste resonates throughout; flavor lingers forever	M: somewhat filmy		Overall, a powerful contribution, but out of balance."
"According to the bottle, this beer is a doppelbock that is smoked with oak wood; their other smoked beers use beech. Poured into a shaker pint glass. Since this is the first beer I've ever had whose name contains no pronounceable words, I will refer to it as OAK-SMOKED BOCK THING from here on.		Oak-Smoked Bock Thing pours an amber color with almost no head. This is not unusual for a doppelbock.		The aroma is quite excellent. It is everything I hope for in a smoked beer. It is chiefly dominated by the smell of campfire smoke, with a hint of bacon on the side.		Though the aroma is great, the taste disappoints. I taste some oak, but I guess smoked wood does not taste as good as a beer aged in oak barrels. It lends an odd flavor to the campfire sensation, which I find distasteful. Less distasteful is the flavor of alcohol, which is not unusual for the style. The bitter hop flavors are unusual, however, and not welcome. The beer is very full in the mouth, great for the style.		Oak-Smoked Bock Thing twists and turns everywhere like a bad soap opera. I definitely prefer the beech-smoked bock I tried from this company last month."
"Decent looking brew from the beer traverler suitcase. Maybe a touch darker in the amber hue than most euro lagers. Malty sweetness with some faint hoppiness in the background for aromas. Strong, sweet malt taste dominates with just a hint of hop bitterness at first. Hop becomes more pronounced later. Just a hint of saltiness as an aftertaste. Must be the Polish water. Bit too sticky for my tastes.		Decent Polish beer, but a bit too sweet and sticky to have more than 1 at a time."
"OK. I'm not one to review a beer that hundreds have already acclaimed but the bottle I'm currently drinking does not equate to BAs general rating.		The nose has hints of the addition of cheap fruit syrup and the taste is the same. Too sweet. Am I just not getting it?"
"Reviewed 12/11/2009 (Bottle):		Pours a clear golden orange colored body, bubbly. Huge foamy slightly off-white head, average sized bubbles. Funky aroma, grainy. Effervescent. Lagery. Cooked vegetables. Fizzy, foamy. Some hops. Funky taste, vegetably. Not as bad a taste as the smell. Letting air out a bit. Better as it warms up. Not as vegetably, but not a fan of the flavor."
"Pours a ruby red color. Very effervescent with a white soda pop foam that dissapates to nothing. Aromas are mostly filled with raspberries, some biscuit malt, and a little alcohol. Hmm, flavor is super sticky, super sweet and basically an alcoholic raspberry syrup. Hops aren't particularly detected, nor are any malts used. Carbonation is too low; I feel a fruit beer should be crisp and light. This is quite a dissapointment, I expected something better. Alcohol and raspberry Italian soda, move on."
"Wow. Being a fan of American smoked porters, I was excited to try a rauchbier. I don't think anything could have prepared me for this one, save a bottle of KC Masterpiece. The beer pours a transparent dark brown/red color with a thin white head. Good retention and lacing. The smell is pure smoked hickory, jerky, and anything else you would find at a barbecue pit. 		Unfortunately the taste is the same. It is straight-up smoked meat, hickory, and barbecue sauce. I tried very hard to decipher ""beer"" qualities (like hops or malt) and just couldn't find them. I'm sorry to say I had a very difficult time even finishing this beer. The taste is that pungent. But I do understand what this beer is trying to accomplish, and appreciate its uniqueness, which is why I didn't slam its score. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. 		If you know what you're getting into, love barbecued food (enough to drink it), or want a completely new beer experience, try this rauchbier. Personally it was a little too much for me to handle, and has probably made me gun shy toward other rauchbiers out there. I'll stick to the American smoked."
"Appearance: Pours a light, hazy copper body with no real head or lacing to speak of.		Smell: Stinging aroma of concord grapes and rubbing alcohol. Quite similar to a cheap, well brandy.		Taste: Harsh and astringent, to say the least. Hints of dry, stale bubblegum mixed sweetened fortified wine paint a picture of a beer gone horribly awry. However, any amiss flavors are immediately drowned out by the blisteringly hot alcohol burn. In a word: Yeesh! 		Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied, with an oily, sticky mouthfeel.		Drinkability: All of the wonderous qualities that make for a truly delicious quadruple were totally abandoned for this brew. Definitely the most un-quad ""quad"" I have ever tasted, and a real stomach churner, too."
"A forceful pours reveals a dark brown with ruby edges color and a sturdy 1 1/2"" beige head that sits very still. Good lacing.		What a roasted & smoky nose! Great balance of charred wood and dark roasted malts. Dark chocolate notes are prevalent as well. Very fresh and blossoming scents.		A thin taste of roasted malts and dark bitter chocolate. Definite smoke flavor makes its appearance midway through, but doesn't stick around long. There's a funny plastic taste that I can't get away from though - like it was aged in a milk gallon jug or something (?). 		Mouthfeel was a bit thin and on the lighter side of medium bodied.	Not a lot of flavor is present towards the somewhat dry finish.		Drinkability for me is 'one and done'. Although the light(er) body and a safe amount of smoke flavor could add to its appeal.		Not to impressed with this, but not under whelmed either. I'm glad I tried it, but I probably wouldn't buy it ever again."
This beer poured a hazy yellow color with no real head to speak of. The nose was all wheat malt. No clove and banana. Just another stupid American wheat. Taste has hints of lemon intermixed with the wheat flavor that dominates. The feel was thin and rather boring. This is not a beer I would recommend. Its just plain without anything that kept me interested.
"Appearance: deep amber, great clarity, a medium layer of off-white foam flattens to a sudsy film within 60 seconds		Aroma: inviting semi-sweet almondy/candy-like aroma, caramelly malts, ethereal hops, toffee		Flavor: less sweet than expected from the aroma, quite a toasty malt profile with a touch of roast, the woody hop flavor comes in along-side a pert bitterness, hop flavor is a bit ""pukey"", finishes quite dry with a tangy and bitterish aftertaste with a slight meatiness		Mouthfeel: medium body with light carbonation, a bit astringent		Overall Impression: This is purportedly one of their most popular beers. I can see why... it appeals to the widest range of palates (i.e.- not very complex). Not every beer needs to be complex or interesting, but that's usually something that I look for in a beer."
"My early college years and late teens were spent gathering a few dollars to buy a few of these 40's. We knew once we had about two or three we were almost done. No one liked to drink it straight,so we mixed it with juice. I believe that's how it got it's nickname ""Crack juice"".	 The color golden straw,no head , come to think of it where was my head when I drank this stuff ?	 The aroma was of malts and grains-nothing special. The taste was sweet & sour,malts,alcohol and something not of this world.	I meant that in a very bad way.	The finish is slightly bitter,metallic and the medium carbonation is fine;but nothing could save this beer. 	A reminder of what some companies/Brewers will produce and call a beer."
Bland, a bit corny, a bit adjuncty, may have some hop flavour.... i couldn't tell. A touch bitter i suppose. Tastes like sparkling mineral water. Just an even lighter version of Amstel (the normal stuff), which sounds dissapointing, and it is dissapointing, but, to be truthful, i wasn't expecting much in the first place, its hard to right something about it in detail, boring.
Hazy golden yellow color with a quick fizzy white head that fades a little too quickly for my liking. Aroma has more of a sweeter citrus character, almost like lemonade with a bit of spice on top. Taste begins a bit sweet, maybe some tangerine, but really gets dominated by the tart acidity the lemons bring out. Body is just too light for the citrus flavors and any spices that were added also seem to have been drowned out by the tartness. Too acidic and tart to be enjoyable.
"Served cold from tap to beer challice, at ""Revolution Brewing Co"" in Chicago		A) Appearance is slightly cloudy but light easily passes through, golden, 1 inch white head that lasts several minutes		S) Strong, robust, spicey, alcohol is abundant 		T) Bam! Strong bitter hoppy smack. Pungent, Pinesol, sour, grassy. Strong sweet malt as well.		M) Long lasting, ample carbonation. Stays consistent through the pour.		D) One was plenty for me. I acknowledge this style -- Imperial IPA -- is really not my favorite."
"A - Pours a deep brown with only the faintest of ruby around the edges. Light has a hard time passing through the one, with half an inch of thick tan head that left heavy lacing.		S - BEANS, smokey beans and meat. This is the dominat arome from this beer, there is little to no noticable malts or hops, the aroma is simply taken over by this smoked meat and beans smell.		T - An over the top extreme flavors of BBQ, as if they simply squeezed a steak and pork`n`beans into a glass.		M - Full-bodied and syrupy in texture but very smooth and leaves a formitable aftertaste that lasts long ofter the beer.		D - For what the beer is it is a work of art, but can only be truely appricated once in a while."
"This stuff is crap, it is slightly darker in color than most malts (similar to OE) yet the taste and smell are simply awful; reminscent of vomit. kind of an oily mouthfeel. the only upside is that it is 8.2%ABV and $1.99 for 40 oz so if you can stomach this stuff you'll be feelin good. i cant though. sorry Snoop"
"Nice deep black color. Frothy and creamy tan head with excellent retention and lace. 		Plenty of roasted character in the nose. Coffee, dark chocolate and dark fruits.		Initial taste follows the smell although slightly weaker. Some roasted and smokey character. Prunes and figs. Not bad. Then halfway through the drink, the beer turns on your tastebuds and reeks havoc with an awful sour flavor. The finish can best be described as sour milk, horrible!		Lighter bodied, slightly creamy and fairly low carbonation.		The awful aftertaste makes it practically undrinkable unless you have no taste buds. Don't get me wrong, I love stouts and I have tried good cream stouts but this is not one of them. Stay away!"
"A - Pours out a thick black color with a foamy tan head. Nice lacing.		S - It smelled toasty and smoke-like. There was also a malty and chocolate aroma.		T - It had a wood-like taste, like from a barbeque. It also reminded me a little of a cigar. Very interesting.		M - Soft and creamy. It is heavy-bodied.		D - It is very different from any other beer I've tried and it was pretty good."
"a - nice clear orange yellow color with a 1.5 finger head that disappears quickly. No lacing. 		s - it smelled a tad skunked when I initially poured it. After letting it sit for a minute or so It appeared to be gone. Mostly grass and yeast in the smell, a little hops. 		t - grassy earthy flavor with spicy hops. Noticeably bitter. Slight tingle left behind, clean and slightly dry. After I swallow if I squeeze my cheeks together I get a really bitter taste, it's kind of odd. 		m - light body, smooth, decent carbonation		d - This beer is ok I guess. It's light and refreshing at first, but the bitterness I get at the end kind of ruins it for me. I'm glad the skunking went away in the smell. Czechoslovakia/Czech Rebublic, i'm a bit disappointed, but I'll be back to try your other brews :)"
Brewery's website describes this as a dark wheat seasonal novelty produced only in January and February. This pours from a 12 oz bottle a hazy, odd colored, brown body that is close to bottled tea. Small offwhite head quickly falls into a film and no lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is mostly milk chocolate, with subdued notes of cherries. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with prickly high carbonation. The taste is sweetish essence of milk chocolate. No sensation of malts or hops here. The sweet cherry essence is sensed, but is subdued. This is not a bad beer, and I like chocolate and cherry flavors, but this is very one dimensional and the chocolate and cherry notes seem forced and out of place. I applaud small breweries like O'Fallon who like to experiment with new styles, and their Pumpkin Ale was very nice. This one was like drinking a pale ale infused with chocolate covered cherry essence, and it doesn't work for me. Very strange beer in taste, aroma, and appearance. Worth a try because it is unlike anything I've ever tasted, but I would really have to have a huge craving for chocolate cherry beer to want to have another.
From my notes 5/30/2007 pours a two-finger off-white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving no lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light hoppy nose. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Flavor is similar to American macros - corn, hoppy, occasional sweetness. Lingering bitter aftertaste. Bottled Mar 21, 2007, best Mar 21, 2008. Labeled as Brasserie Nationale, 1.00 ($1.37) 250ml bottle from a cigarette shop Luxembourg, Luxembourg.
"Poured dark mahogany/amber with minimal head.		Smells like a fireplace fire. I also got the smell of Skoal chewing tobacco...brings back bad memories when I tried that back in HS and ended up sick as a dog.		Tastes like you would expect, very smoky with a bacon flavor. I had read this in other posts and expected it to be a real heavy beer but it really isn't.		Medium bodied with good carbonation.		Drinkability is very low for me. I'm glad I tried the style but it isn't for me. Based on the taste I'm sure that this is a great representation of the stylye, but again, not for me. Maybe I'll revisit it in a couple years but for now, no thanks."
"A: Pours dark black with a mocha colored head. Good retention and some chunky lace.		S: Roasty malt, caramel, and dark chocolate.		T: Wow sour... this one is infected. Beneath the infection you can still pick up dark malt, chocolate, and tart dark fruit.		M: Medium in body, the tartness from the infection is overthetop and as you can expect ruins the beer.		D: Nah, would love to rerate with a good bottle."
"Served in a wine glass at ~65F		Pours a solid mocha head, with an deep oily, syrup-like body; opaque black body. 		Intense roast coffee upfront, milk chocolate covered caramels leads to a prominent alcohol bourbon vanilla fade. Notes with molasses, maple, and some licorice round out the scents.		Bourbon is the star here with HUGE barrel flavor; oak, vanilla, and maple. Fades to a dark chocolate, slightly bitter finish, with lingering alcohol warmth. Very sweet and boozy; so much so that it hinders drinkability. Alcohol heat needs to mellow considerably.		Velvet mouthfeel; tongue coating and heavy. A fine sipping dessert beer, that would be fantastic with some age (~2yrs)."
"Yes, the spelling is correct. Though the name suggests the possibility of this being a Belgian-style tripel, the brew bears little resemblance to historic Belgian styles. Consequently the Americanized spelling of Triple is honest for partially curtailing any such expectations.			This beer is luminous spun gold. It is clear with a spotty head and well-intentioned lace. There is very little carbonation  just a few confused bubbles. The mouthfeel is like dry paper. 			Regardless of any intended style comparisons, TGs Triple is not an especially strong beer. No, let me rephrase that; its not an especially good beer. Its actually quite strong, though it seems that every batch has a different ABV rating. Mine, in October 04, was 9.3%. Triple has a light fruity aroma, but I otherwise found it tart and confused with hints of apple pectins and bacterial infringement. At times it was downright cloying. The substantial alcohol content detracted from the potential of the malt environment, turning this into a complex and elegant American malt liquor.			Triple is harsh and otherwise lacks definition. Terminal Gravity produces some world-class beers, but this is not one of them."
"22oz bottle purchased at Archer Liquors, in Chicago. I think.		A- Tries to pour a clear orange, but there are floaties everywhere. I even left quite a bit in the bottom of the bottle and there are still chunks floating all over the place. Nice white head on initial pour and throughout the beer. Good lacing. Just can't get past all the particles. 	S- Typical IIPA hop profile in the nose. Some grapefruit notes, but nothing special stands out.	T- Heavy (what appears to be) floral and citrus hops. Bitter, but not in a good way. Needs a bigger malt backbone to balance out the hops. 	M - Medium body, fairly heavy yet almost dry. 	D- None. This is a one-note pony (hops) and not even a good one at that. Too much bittering hops and not enough malt make finising this a chore, and I will not be seeking this out again.		Overall - Not much of anything positive to report. Another IIPA that pales in comparison to the greats out there. Bitter to the point of harsh, the definition of below average. Avoid."
"Poured a very pale yellow. No head whatsoever. Some bready aroma, but very light. Very faint lemony flavor. Extremely light malt flavors that finished with a distinct light beer aftertaste. 	This beer shoud've been labeled as a light beer. Shame on me for buying a lager with an ABV less than 4. Almost any mass produced light beer is better than this one. I even drank it after mowing my lawn. Should've had a tall glass of water."
"A: Deep golden brown with practically no head and light lacing.	S: Sweet malt smell with a strange light malt smell.	T: Blah. Very unsweet, dirt-like flavor.	M: A kick in the mouth. Like trying to down carbonated water. Medium to light body.	D: I would have a hard time drinking too much of this as it is not tasty and it bothers my tongue."
"So I'm giving Trafalgar another kick at the can...		a-promising clear dark ruby colour with a decent head and some lacing on the glass.		s-malty, alcohol smell with an ever so slight bitterness suggesting some hops.		t-mild malt character....alcohol burn...very little hop bitterness.		m-thin...way too thin IMO. I have had 4%ers feel thicker and have more body on the tongue than this beer.		d-not bad but there are better Bock beers out there if you are looking for it.		This was better than the last Trafalgar I had...I think they are starting to listen to customers."
"This offering poured a medium golden hue with a mid range crown of light fluffy foam. The body was medium/light and the mouthfeel quite pleasant.	Unfortunatley, this brew came with that nasty skunk odour that also penetrated the taste, and leaving a slight bitter after taste.	Not a bad brew, Amstel just needs to address that aroma/taste issue, but not a good brew either."
"A friend of mine got this at a local bar (his review is actually somewhere below) and after punishing himself with a few sips, managed to goad me into indulging my own morbid curiosity.		While it has the appearance of any number of great German beers, that is where the praise ends for this beast.		Smell: I'm a smoker and I thought the smoky odor was overwhelming. Simply an assault upon the olfactory glands. It's the kind of smell that makes me desperately reach for a febreeze bottle, hoping that my parents don't notice that all of my clothes smell smokey.		Taste: To quote Barney Gumble ""Someone spilled beer in this ashtray!""		Mouthfeel: See above.		Drinkability: I had about two sips before my carcrash fascination wore off and I pushed it back to my friend."
"A: Poured a medium-dark orange with a soft and creamy 2 finger light beige head that lasted for a minute or two before receding and leaving a spothcy, broken sheet leacing. Visible carbonation was medium-strong. 		S: moderately strong with spicy oranges and caramel malt with some noticeable alcohol notes.		T: spicy and sour oranges delivering a big tart presence in the beginning. Overall the flavor was pretty limited in complexity with sharp, acidic, sour oranges that quickly fade to a subtle tart finish. Overall the flavor was quite odd per style I though and best described as alcoholic, tart oranges. 		M: light, slick, and oily with a spicy alcoholic tart orange flavor. 		D: Less then moderate drinkability and not many reasons to try or like. Flavor gets tiring quickly and didn't make me look forward to next sip. Packaged in 500ml bottle and not embarrassed to say I just couldn't finish or rather cared to."
Golden straw, almost no head. Moderate carbonation.  Smells sweet with hint of alcohol and cooked corn.  Somewhat malty with weak hop bitterness that doesn't take your attention away from the fact that this beer tastes like stale corn on the cob.  Spicy alochol quality.  Decent to get drunk, not a good sippin brew.
"From a clear glass 200 cl. bottles with no bottling/freshness date.		Poured a ruby hued brown with a just a few bubbles, no head, quickly settled into a fine bubbly lacing.		Aromas of caramel and buttery toffee, hints of chocolate covered cherries, the cherries is faint and sweet, not tart.		Low carbonation, too low for my taste, and a softly crisp, watery medium-light bodied mouthfeel.		Could be a lot more interesting if it wasn't for the poor carbonation, which leads to a watery, mushy taste, a nice caramel toffee flavor, then a watery (toasted?) graininess, a medicinal hop flavor with no bitterness, some chocolate that mingles with the a sweet cherry drink, not that juicy, but like you find in cheap drinks, and a watery caramel and grainy finish.		I wonder if this is a lot better from the tap, from the bottle it's dull and not very inspiring.		Acquired in a trade with northyorksammy, thanks!"
"Beer #3 sampled at Eastern Oregon DONG (Dudes of Northwest Grog) ""We Will Bock You!"" tasting @ Barley Brown's, 8.6.11.		Medium brown cloudy body, minimal effervescence almost still, little if any head resulted in no lacing. Caramel malts in the nose and wet cardboard, ugh. No plum/prune/raisin esters, a bit of burnt brown sugar, not much in the way of flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty watery, no stickiness. No go, won't do this again. On the low end of the tasting scoring. IMHO, not very good."
".33 cl bottle poured into a Guinness brewhouse series pint glass in Belfort, France, where it was also acquired. Reviewed live. I figure the Simpson's connection is a sort of copyright loophole, but who knows (cares?). 		A: Four finger thin head devoid of cream and of poor retention. Clear yellow colour. 		Sm: Mild strength scent of barley and cream. 		T: Barley and cream. That's it. Simple crap build. It's balanced, but it isn't difficult to balance only two notes. 		Mf: A bit flat, pretty smooth, and overly wet. Doesn't match the crap flavours. Bleh. 		Dr: Low ABV, flat, undrinkable, and garbage. This is one to ignore, though the price is alright. A joke ""beer"" that capitalizes on a marketing scheme to sell product instead of focusing on flavour."
"Poured into a tulip (the glass of choice this evening). Pours a dark mohogany, deep brown with little light seeping through. smelled like I was stuck in a smoked salmon shack, dark charred wood flavour, smokey. Each drink I cringe a bit but its also somewhat enjoyable. This is not for the faint of heart and should be paired with some hearty rich food. Smoked malts dominate and if there are hops I have yet to find them. Bakers chocolate or similair lace the background. Finishes biting and takes some time to recover. 		Its one of those beers to me thats well crafted and well put together but it just doesn't completely work. It's like trying to make smoked cherries. Good beer for the style just not sure this style is good."
"On-tap at Pacific Coast		A: The pour is a shade of amber with a mild off-white head.		S: Plenty of butter is apparent right away. There's some bread and toffee malt character. A very, very light hop aroma to this one. On the whole, the nose is pretty light.		T: Still plenty of butter notes on the palate with a bit of chlorine/pool water flavor. A bit of a grassy hop flavor that provides just a touch of bitterness.		M: The body is medium with a moderate level of carbonation.		D: Good and buttery, just like most of the beers at this brewpub. No thanks."
Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly, leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit hop nose. Flavor is sweet malt but this is an IPA and the hops kick in for a bitter finish. $2.25 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma.
Ruby to brown. Pretty big head on this one that leaves some decent stringy lacing. Smell and taste are all straight woody smoke. Literally a burning campfire in a bottle that completely overtakes anything else that might be in there. Interesting at first but pretty one-dimensional. This is a taste I only want so much of. Smooth chewy mouthfeel though. Drank with my Thanksgiving turkey. I feel like this really needs to be paired with some big pungent cheeses or charred meat.
"Opaque orange body with a head so low, it is submarine.	Whisky malt and peet aroma.	One dimensional maltiness followed by leather and huge, just huge tobacco. Big bitterness, followed by burnt cigarettes and more tobacco. Burnt sugar and more bitterness. 	The harsh bitterness detracts from any body the ale may have.	Is this a bad bottle or bad beer, I do not know, but it does not taste like what any of the other reviewers describe."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Slightly hazy amber color with some floating sediment. Pancake head is gone in a minute flat.		Sweet malty aroma in the nose. Faint sour whiskey notes detectable.		Taste is all caramel sweetness initially, not as smoky as a typical wee heavy. Alcohol warming is noticable halfway through the glass, as well as bittering hops. Some (little) smoked peat(not much).		Mouthfeel is a little syrupy, middle of the road carbonation. I'm not sure I would want more than one of these.		 I found it to be a decent beer but not one I would seek out. I also don't think it's a very good representation of the style. The faint smokiness probably means it would pair well with with a good stadium dog or a hearty chowder, but by itself this really just drinks like a malty amber ale."
As a fellow Michigander, I was disappointed by this beer. Founders makes some great beers, so this must be an anomaly. It poured a beautiful dark amber into my glass. It poured very dense, almost like syrup, which is very inviting. It foams up to 1 finger then dissipates down to a light, white lacing. Smells is of vanilla and raw coconut. The coconut flavor overwhelms the smell of the beer. Taste is a little better. Hops, then raw coconut and vanilla, followed by a heavy alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is heavy, but lightly carbonated. The coconut flavor of the beer was so strong that this beer is not drinkable. Perhaps this would be alot better if it were better balanced.
"12oz bottle. 		I went out with a few guys from work to a place with no beer selection at all. They were all drinking this cool beer and I was peer pressured into having one too. I guess if all the cool kids are doing it, it has to be good. Thankfully they weren't pushing something like smoking...		Notes from 9/27/07"
"Well, among light beers this is probably one of my preferred ones. 		Pours golden yellow. Fizzy. Not much head. Weak aroma. Subtle caramel and mild hops. It's funny because it tastes a lot like O'Douls Amber. Thin, but nowhere as thin as something like Coors light. When there's no other choice, this is an acceptable beer."
"Clear brown beer. Minuscule off-white head that withers to a couple floating mats fed by light bubbling. Smells a little malty and peaty, with an unpleasant aspirin odor riding along.		Tastes like raspberry-tinged mineral water. There's some toasty malt in there, but it's mostly mineral water. Thin mouthfeel with very sparky carbonation.		No, thank you. A weird idea that didn't taste much like beer."
"Poured from a 12oz twistoff into my Harpoon Liviathan Baltic Porter glass.		Appearance: Dark black, can not see through it. There was NO head and no laceing.		Smell: Roaster malt, chocolate and coffee.		Taste: Was just OK, malts, strong coffee and a little chocolate came through. Almost a creamy finish. 		Mouthfeel: I get a lot of coffee and not much else with no carbonation. 		Drinkability: I do not have the desire to finish this one. It is just OK and I would not buy another."
"Tasted in Egypt. Most beer-like from all Al Akhram range.		Color pale, appearance libely with a high level of carbonation. Crown medium, falls quickly.		Start spritzy, lemony-malty. Then the hops come in, making the brew drinkable. Body light and thin, aftertaste malty with a faint bitterness.		Stick to this when you don't find any imported beers in an Egyptian bar."
"on tap at Redbone's		By the fate of the beer wheel was I awarded a chill amber pint with no head and no smell. It didn't seem so bad at first, but the fusty backtaste grew steadily harsher until it was slowly overwhelmed by syrupy nastiness.		I think I would have preferred the PBR."
Poured a deep golden color with modest white puffy head. Smell is fruity, bubble gum, malt and absolutely perfect. Taste is somewhat dissapointing. Its almost as if the smell promised me something that the taste just doesn't deliver. A strange metallic taste is at the front and any sweetness to be found is overpowered by a too strong hop bitterness. Very strong alcohol presence also noted. Finishes with very strong alcohol dominating all other tastes. In all the beers that I have reviewed I don't think I have ever had such varying scores for smell the different aspects of the rating. It was difficult to finish this beer. I'm glad I only bought one.
"Pretty refined looking black can with an unassuming golden oval and the La&#353;ko goat staring out at us. Ingredients stated as water, hops, malt and unmalted cereals. Oh well, let's see how this goes...		Pale yellow body, with thin streams of fine carbonation floating leisurely to the top. Excellent crest of white, solid foam, which leaves good lacing. Very decent looking pale lager, everything you'd expect from the style.		Some raisiny sweetness initially on the nose, and maybe just a hint of yeasty bread dough, which is a little unpleasant. Very little though, on the nose, overall, and really it's pretty bland.		Palate has an initial sweet flavour reminiscent of rosewater, but then is descends into a murky mishmash of floury aridity, hops that aren't quite all there, the faint hint of honey and a selzer-water spritz. It's not the generic blandness of just-another-Euro-lager, but the flavours are a mess, and it doesn't know what it's doing. Feel is surprisingly flat and brittle, given the good-looking carbonation.		This one almost has something to it which would put it above the generic pale swill, but it's just everywhere, and what you end up with is a surprising flavoured but ultimately uninspired beer. Given that the standard La&#353;ko offering is a cut above the average, this one is disappointingly mediocre."
"pours out Ice tea amber. Very clear and lots of bubbles but no head to speak of.	Smell is a sour mixture of sugars caramel and spice.	I get a bubblegum flavor in the background. Sweet but not spicey at all. Caramel and some strange spice I can't put my finger on.	Mouthfeel is subtle and not a lot going on otherwise. 	Not a bad beer, just a 'could be better' beer."
"Bomber split with the bro.		Pours a turbid, dark, leathery copper colored brew with tons of particles in suspension, and it's kind of freaky looking as it doesn't move. Great head though ... off-white, super creamy and sticky. But man, all of that sediment is kind of off-putting.		Pungent nose. Tons of fresh grapefruit, spice and herbal. Minty. Cheesy. Resiny as hell. Eye-watering. My eyes!		Smooth, medium-bodied on the palate with an intense smackdown of hops on the palate. Sharp citric acids, lemon, lime, big grapefruit, pine, grassy, coarse and resiny. Scorched leaves and ash. Some cheese and soap too. Super astringent. Puckering. As for the malts, there's a touch of caramel and bread, but it's pretty much stomped to death by the crazy and out of control hop presence. Finish is bone dry, bitter, rough and astringent. 		I'm a hophead, but I think this is overkill. 168IBU. Why bother? That's past the human threshold. A waste of hops. There's absolutely no balance (yes, there can be balance within the style) and it's hard to get down the throat. It's like drinking a handful of hops dropped into a pint glass of brew, and anyone who has ever attempted this can attest that this is not overly pleasant."
"A nice dark cranberry-brown red. Fine head.		Nose smells artificial (as my roommate said: nail polish). Very cherry. Some tartness. Taste is light but satisfying. Minor chocolate bitterness on the finish. Drinkable and refreshing, but I hoped for something more robust.		A bit thin on the mouth. A nice thick chocolate stout with added cherries would be the way to go - this just seems too light and mild.		As I said: drinkable, but I was hoping for something more viscous, more potent, and more delicious. A fine change of pace though."
Umm, I haven't had all that many smoked porters or smoked beers in general for that matter. Maybe it's just my personal taste but, if I want a ham sandwich, I'll have a ham sandwich.
"22oz bomber, 12 oz pour into pint glass.		Ruby-red, clear elixir, thin tan head, moderate lacing.		Heavy spices: cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla.		A mess of the above spices with a thin malt presence--like drinking a glass of holiday potpourri. 		First mediocre beer from HF. Had the BA version, which was well balanced, with the barrel-aging cutting down the spices. Can't recommend this version, though."
Pours with a decent size head, that quickly dissipates, leaving little lace - pretty much just a ring at the high-water mark. Looks a hazy flourescent orange, which isn't ugly, but is kind of off. Smells just don't jump out but there is some fruitiness. Taste is much the same, with a bitterness that builds quickly and holds fairly long in the aftertaste. Another reviewer mentioned saltiness in the hops flavor, and I absolutely agree. Seems different, but not unpleasant. However, there seems to be more carbonation than necessary. Not quite at seltzer level, but pretty high. Certainly not a bad beer, especially for a licensed, gimmicky kind of thing, but I can't see buying it for anything but novelty value.
"Nothing to recommend here. Typical disappointing lager, the favourite for a drunken night on a town for many. 		I'm afraid Carling is just not worth it for me. Plain, thin taste in general. Slight taste of hops and malt too. The one advantage, pretty much every pub shall sell this one."
"Appearance: Dark chocolate color with a small creamy head and good bubbles.		Aroma: Quite smoky/peaty notes. Coffee and chocolate aromas also present.		Taste: Wxplosive burnt/smoked malt all over the palate. Again, chocolate and coffee, with a hoppy balance in the finish.		Mouthfeel: Coating mouthfeel, with a smooth, rich finish.		Drinkability: By no means my style of beer, but a noble effort from a tiny brewery. Doubt I would try again unless I learn to like smoked beers more."
Pours dark brown, almost black with a thick, very thick and frothy tan head. Very reminicent of a root beer. The aroma is dominated by caramel and a bit of a musty aroma. I also sence fruit. The taste isof caramel and in my opinion, not a very good example of a stout.
"A: Medium orange brown with some pretty big floaties, head is off white, and it mostly large bubbles that fade pretty fast. 		S: Light taking a smell tour through adjunct city. Sweet with notes of corn, rice, and biscuit. Slightly earthy.		T: Sweet, with cooked vegetables. A hint of earthy hops, and a bit of funk in the finish. 		M: To thick for the style and not carbonated enough for the style. Perhaps the two go hand and hand. 		O: I have sent this as a gag extra in a lot of trades, but never actually tried it myself. This style isn't my favorite, and this beer is a poor representation of the style. It's a novelty, and not something I will ever drink again. However, it is still a great gag gift, which is my guess as to why it sells at all. Sub-Par in every way imaginable."
"The colour is pale gold; the large foam (created by the nitro-widget) sinks down to a  finger compact off-white head. Some lacing. 		The smell got notes of boiled vegetables, minerals and a touch of wet cardboard.		The taste is first very mild, and then some stuffy malty notes emerge. A quickly passing sweet flavours leaves room for some minerals and a hint of cream. The aftertaste is very wishy-washy with hints of paper/cardboard and some malt-sweetness in the background. 		The carbonation is mild, the few bubbles are microscopic and smooth. The liquid is very smooth, as expected from a nitro-can.		Wishy-washy. A waste of malt and hops, although it doesn't seem to be a lot of those ingredients in this beer."
"note: this is my first scotch ale.		poured from the bottle a very dark burgandy color. definitely appealing to the eye. the head was tan and not unusual.		smell is good, with malt dominating and caramel and chocolate in the background. 		the taste, though, is disappointing. as at least one other user said, it tastes like cough medicine, and i couldn't agree more. there is a little bit of malt present at the end of the taste, but really, this is not my cup of tea. i can't compare this to other scotch ales. all i can say is that i don't care for it. the only positive thing i can say is that the malt tastes very fresh and delicious...but everything else just seems to get in its way.		mouthfeel is sticky with an abundance of alcohol present.		this is obviously a very successful beer as far as its demand, but i consider it a ""novelty beer."" it reminds me of the big ""ice beer"" fad, where people, seeking more alcohol, convinced themselves there was superior flavor in those beers. this beer is overhyped, and if it wasn't for its name, it would probably be far less popular than it is."
"I drank this from a 12oz bottle into a goblet.		The beer pours a clear bright pink with little head and lacing.		The aroma is light very sweet, a little bit of cherry, but I wish it was more balaned and provided a little tartness.		The taste is like the aroma, very sweet, cherry flavored, but its somehow just plain and boring. No complexity here at all.		The feel is very bad, worse than water if that's possible.		Drinkability is low.		Overall, this is a horrible fruit beer. It should not be consumed."
Appeared darker than normal for a maibock, medium amber with a good deal of haze and a raggedy with an offwhite rocky head. The nose was very sweet caramel, fruits and malts. It smelled more like a ale than a lager, but could have just been very ripe and not lagered enough. The taste was much like the smell, except the sweetness was cloying and overbearing. It was like drinking an alcoholic malt syrup, with the alcohol being a tad too prevelant. I made it through one glass, but I think they need to aim for more subtle characteristics and a lengthened lagering period to even out the flavors and reduce the ale characteristics.
Well, Founders are my favorite brewery and I had high hopes for this. Unfortunately, I was very letdown by this years Nemesis. Nothing more than a sweet, sticky dark IPA IMO. The hops overpower what may have been an interesting combo. The malts want to present themselves but can't. Leaves a nasty coating on the mouth after drinking. Like Karo Syrup or something. I am a hophead and this just didn't do it for me. Of all the great beers Founders releases, not sure why this was Nemesis 2010. I love ya Founders but this may have been one of my least favorite beers of yours.
"A - poured a dark amber red, crystal clear, into a straight glass. Although I was very careful and poured gently, it yielded a massive head that forced me to wait until it died down to pour the 3/4 bottle left. No lacing, quick to diminish.		S - strangely perfumey and flowery. Hint of sweet malts, some alcohol thrown in, slight honey tone? That weird perfume smell was in their pale ale too... maybe it's the yeast?		T - sweet herbal tea with an alcoholic finish and a touch of bitterness. Some caramel sweetness. Again, that yeast has some off flavors here...		M - light bodied, over carbonated at first but then it becomes too flat quickly. What's going on here?!		D - ugh, this is a drain pour. 		Overall - I've had a number of beers from Cooperstown and every single one that I had yielded an exploding head that required me to wait to finish pouring. Worse yet, every single one has a very strange perfumey and flowery aroma that seems very off flavored. Furthermore, when looking at the sediment left behind, I see a collection of pinhead sized ""pellets"" on the bottom of the bottles. I wonder if these ""pellets"" are infectious colonies of bacteria/yeast but I see these in each bottle that I had."
"A- Very dark brown almost black in the middle. Think foam head on top but it dissipates fairly quickly. 		Smell - A bit of char, somewhat metallic?		Taste -A bit of burnt coffee and earthiness, a bit of malt, some smoke and char but not very full. Kind of a burnt taste lingers. A bit of brightness when it first hits the tongue. It starts off as if it might be a pretty good beer but it is too thin and the taste dissipates quickly leaving the burnt char flavor. 		Mouthfeel - small fizzy bubbles - kind of thin and flat though. 		Drinkability - OK - wouldn't have it again. Even though it has the smokier burnt-type flavors it still is very light and doesn't carry the flavor through. 		(chilled can poured into a glass)"
For a light beer it's not all that bad. I'll drink one if it's handed to me but I'm not going to necessarily ever look for it (not that it's hard to find). Darker shade of gold so it's not as pale looking as many other light lagers. Sweet, grainy/hay taste, watery but also nothing bad either. Really, actually, one of the better light beers I've had.
"Sampled at the '07 Knoxville Brewers Jam, but I'm just getting around to posting my notes.		The look of the YPA was amber-orange with a pale, (nearly) white head. Smell was a bit on the light side with a touch of hops coming through. Taste was hope forward, mostly floral.. Bit of creaminess in the mouthful as well as a high carbonation sharpness. Interesting combination. As far as drinkability goes, I think there are better PA's out there. This one, for me, was a touch below average."
"A - pours an amber pinkish red with no foam to speak of		S - slight hints of cherry and some light malt		T - strong sour cherry flavor that gets you in the back of your jaw		M/D - nice carbonation, the mouthfeel is a little weird to me, i like the sour cherries but its almost too fruity. Its like drinking a wine cooler"
"500ml bottle into a Hoegaarden Tulip. 5.5%ABV apparently.		Pours a dark amber with plenty of head. No issues yet.		Smell is very sour apples. Like a lambic experiment gone awry; guess that's the Ringwood Hops. A tang of malty sweetness is perceptible.		Taste is metallic, sour and bitter. Not a great trifecta. Almost get an immediate urge to pour it down the sink but something unspecified intrigues me and I persevere. Bad idea.		Mouthfeel is reasonably light which is probably just as well.		I don't get it."
"Pours deep auburn with a short, but stable off white head. Aroma of smoke. Ham, bacon pick any smoked meat with a little malt sweetness. Moderate body and medium carbonation.		This is not a brew to consume in mass quantities. I don't know if I'd enjoy this alone, but it compliments artisinal cheddar chees quite well."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a New Belgium snifter. It turns out this beer really needs to warm up before its characteristics other than bittering hops and alcohol present themselves.		A - A 1-finger beige/cream-colored thick foam head developed late in the pour and dissipated pretty quickly leaving few traces of lace on the glass. Deep ruby/copper, burnt rust color that's pretty clear.		S - Very little going on in the nose at first. Malts seem to be competing with the bittering hops with neither getting up out of the glass. Slight caramel rises with the alcohol. Once it really got warmed up, the malts stepped forward like a young Scotch whiskey. It also presents subtle tart cherries.		T - Toasted, roasted malts. Pronounced bittering hops on the finish that really linger. This finish, accented by the above-normal abv, is what this beer is all about.		M - Creamy with slight carbonation. The bittering hops wash away the already thin structure quickly. When warmed, this approaches watered-down bitter Scotch.		D - The bittering and the abv over-power the malts. Lacks the caramel characteristics of a good Scotch ale. Needs to be way too warm to get any of the nuances going, and by then, the beer is flat. At that point, a good single malt would be much more satisfying."
Poured from the bottle, this is a hazy amber color with a scant white head that quickly fades away. It has a faint fruity smell. There is a pleasant mild flavor of apple and pear which is unfortunately overwhelmed by a saccharine sweetness that is the dominant flavor of this ale. For what it's worth, the mouthfeel is rich. The drinkeability is handicapped by overly sweet taste of this ale. Back to the drawing board.
"22 oz bomber to pint glass		Pours a rich reddish-brown that, although isn't cloudy or murky, is dark enough to let little light through. It's seems to be amply carbonated, but the small head quickly dissipates leaving little lacing.		The nose is a little flat. Given the description on the bottle, I was expecting something unique and layered, but I could have mistaken this for Newcastle (sorry NC fans). You can pick up a bit of the orange, but given that the label mentions orange was added, you're smelling for it.		The flavors are a bit more pronounced than the scent, but they're perhaps less interesting. You're met with roasted malts and orange, but the flavors don't pop, at all, and they're combined with muddy, earthy tones that becomes cloyingly sweet as the sip progresses. This beer needs something else. Hops, perhaps? Perhaps not, it's simply unbalanced.		Given the wispy head, I wasn't expecting a lot of viscosity and I wasn't surprised. This is light on the tongue and not in a good way, especially for an 8% Belgian. I've noticed some 'chewy' references here - maybe I got a bad bottle? Possibly, but I'm not sure bad batches/bottles change the body much, and this is pretty damn thin for 8%		This beer clearly doesn't work and it's not something I would seek out again, but it doesn't fail - it's not the worst thing I've tried and I like what they were trying to do here. There's a template in there to work from. But if I was Caldera I would go back to the drawing board on this one."
"Poured a reddish brown. Smells like grain and earthy hops. Not much head to it.		Kind of a bland, somewhat too earthy and almost sour flavor. A bit weird, actually. I'm not sure what it tastes like. Grain laden wheat chaff, perhaps? Just a strange beer, not really a brown ale, but not like much else I've had.		Thin mouthfeel. This brewery makes better."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle. Purchased from Total Wine in Chesapeake, Virginia.		(Appearance): Pours an almost midnight brown/ black with a 3/4 finger sized light brown foam head.		(Smell): The smell is definitely subdued in this one, although there are slight hints of chocolate and toffee.		(Taste): This stout tastes more like a can of Cola mixed with cheap liquor than any kind of well composed brew. This identity crisis gives it a very cheap and ""college party"" failure vibe that just takes any enjoyment or class out of trying to drink it. 		(Mouthfeel): Moderately carbonated and feels surprisingly syrupy; as a matter of fact, much too syrupy. After the wash down, the very ""viscous soda"" feeling lingers on all parts of the mouth. Gross. 		(Drinkability): Not drinkable. If you were to receive a bottle for free, it would be worth trying for the sake of trying to comprehend how it ever got on the shelf. I couldn't even finish my entire glass. Do not buy."
"The beer was poured from a 500ML bottle into an imperial pint glass.		Well it started off pretty well. Nice looking deep yellow in color with a two finger white head that fell away fairly quickly.		The smell is of sour grains a bit malty.		The taste is a bit unfortunate I felt. Everything is so subtle - a little bit malty some hos on the end but faint and it leaves me with the feeling of nothingness.		The mouthfeel is below average. It is too carbonated in regards to the prickle of the bubbles. That makes it distracting to me. The body is light.		This is a below average version of a style that is not considered the most exciting. I look for nuance here and I am not finding that at all. I'll move on."
"Tempting though it might be for a beer called ""Winter Gale"", it'd be a bit strong to say that this Ale ""blows"". However, Canoe's winter warmer only routinely fulfilled its job description, and failed to impress otherwise. 		I bought it on a suitably grim evening, and perhaps unfairly tasked the beer with providing an instant fix of ruddy jocularity. I (too?) vigorously poured half the 22oz bottle into a brandy snifter, and witnessed a bloomy white head rapidly collapse like a bad souffle atop the impressively clear caramel-coloured ale. 		Encouraged by the previous reviewer, I expected to get hit with a festive blast of brandy and dried fruit. Mild spices, brandy and dates were detectable, but vaguely -- it was like sniffing a box that had once housed a Christmas pudding a long time ago.		The taste was curiously weak. I might have hyped this one up for myself, so take my review with that in mind, but the rich, warm flavours I had expected didn't arrive. It tasted pretty boozy, and mysterious traces of fruit and cloves came and went, which was pleasant. But to be brutally honest my first impression was of a house ale with a shot of cheap brandy dumped into it. That sounds harsh, and to give fair dues it improved with time (and temperature). By the end of the 22oz I was certainly warmer and more cheerful, and I'd learned to appreciate the subtle flavours.		In the mouth it was thin and flat without much character, but very smooth and the alcohol, while prominent, didn't burn or anything.		The blurb on the back says that this beer will improve with age, and I bet that would bring out one or two of the flavour notes that are merely hinted at in its young phase. As it is, it doesn't have enough going for it for me to consider buying another one."
"Apperance: WOW huge head, about 1/4 inch of beer and 5 or 6 inches of head. Repeat. Finally get about 2"" of beer, it is a chestnut-brown color.		Smell: Metallic notes dominate, followed by a nutty maltiness. No bourbon.		Taste: Again the metallic twange, also some coffee, toffee, roast, and nuttiness. No bourbon.		Mouthfeel: Thin and dry		Drinkability: it took me 15 mins to pour two inches of beer, I gave up as it wasn't that rewarding. I assume it was infected."
"12oz into a pokal glass.		pours a pale, crystal clear yellow. gives me 2 fingers of coarse foamy head that dies down quick and leaves a few legs of lace.		smell is grainy with a hint of spice.		what little taste it has comes through as stale bread. no hop character at all, not even enough to taste balanced. the body on this is watery with way too much carbonation, which sort of gives it a spicy feel. goes way beyond prickly.		i suppose you could argue that this is super drinkable, but the mouthfeel really hurt this for me. also, with no flavor, why would anyone _want_ to drink this? even a cheap 40 of malt liquor is better than this."
They claim that it is carbonated for a crisp finish, using Cascade aroma hops and Challenger bittering hops. Well, I had a hard time even starting with this one. WOW, is that bitter!!! Very nice color and as usual, not much of a head. If you like bitter ales, The Ship Inn is were you need to be.
"Served from a 22oz. bottle at EBF 2010 in Boston, MA into a tasting glass at the appropriate temperature (02/20/10).		A: It had to be poured out extremely slowly so I was already anticipating some over the top carbonation. Once it was finally in the glass, it was quite dark with a one finger light tan head. 		S: Aroma is of wood, roasted malt, chocolate and perhaps some bitter coffee or chocolate. 		T: The taste is truly hard to decipher from the extreme carbonation. From what i can detect this is certainly a wood aged stout with layers of chocolate, and bitter chocolate.		M: Oh dear! The carbonation is so high that the flavor is almost completely masked. I feel bad giving any beer such a low score, but the mouthfeel here is truly awful. This is perhaps the most carbonated beer or perhaps beverage I have ever had.		D: The extreme carbonation really limits this one.		Overall this beer was extremely disappointing. By far the worst mouthfeel of any Imperial Stout that I have tried. I am not terribly familiar with Pike Pub & Brewery and I will certainly give this beer a try in the future to confirm whether or not I just received a pour from a bad bottle or not."
Brown color, light brown bubbles, no lacing. Aromas of caramel, bread, raisin. Flavors of light malt, bread crust, clean finish. Mouthfeel is light, dry, clean, simple. This beer is about as boring as this review, not crazy about it. Good quaffer, but not the top of its class.
"12oz can.		A very light slightly yellow color with a small white head. Nose is bad, it's got a weird of smell with some adjunct an alcohol aromas.		Taste is very plain, bland and boring. It isn't as bad as many but it's not good. There's a sharp light carbonation with a watery mouthfeel and a bad after taste."
"Serving: 12oz bottle		A nearly lifeless true yellow beer shows a very hazy complextion with a thin collar of glossy white head that leaves behind very little lacing.		Lots of bitter tangy wheat, sour fruit esters and bitter yeast dominate the nose with a touch of lemon zest.		Tons of zesty wheat and lemon zest flow over the palate from start to finish with suggestions of bitter yeast on the finish. Off sour flavors creep in from the beginning to make a stink on the finish, maybe this is a property of the wheat but it is a bit unpleasant.		A quick finish, medium body, and off bitter yeats paired with sour wheat acheive an below average score for drinkability. Thin on the palate this goes down fairly easy, though I can't see drinking more than one.		A meager attempt at a real german hefeweizen, ther eare better true hefeweizens from germany, though this one is worth a try.		There is no freshness date on the bottle so this one may be out of date since it has already been retired.		Cheers!"
"I bought this one in a green bottle, which looked attractive but really brought on the skunk. Why does anyone use green?		Appearance was nothing special. And the nose--did I mention skunky?		Taste was thin, watery, sweet-ish. Off flavors toward the bottom. 		Just a real nasty and unimpressive beer altogether. I am going to rinse my mouth out and have another type. ANY other type."
"Appearance - Amber color with a creamy off white head.		Aroma - Light hop and grass aroma. 		Palate - Light carbonation, very smooth.		Flavor - Light hop flavor with a slight metallic aftertaste. 		Final thoughts - Drinkable brew but not memorable. I'm not big on the metalic aftertaste."
"First a little history. Aruba is located in the middle of the Carribean. The Carribean is salt water. Aruba is only 70 sq. mi. in area. There are 94 K residents and God only knows how many people visit daily. The average daily temperature is 82 degrees year 'round. 	 A friend just brought me a 22cl can back from his visit to the island. At first I looked at the can and thought, 'How can I rate a beer in just two swigs?' After the first sip I thought, 'Man, I wish this swill came in a 10cl can!' I don't know how long my friend had this can in the warm weather, but I think this one was skunked. You'd have to chill this baby with liquid nitro to get it cold enough to kill the taste. 	 On the can is written, 'Made from pristine Aruban waters', or something like that. Am I going nuts? You're in the middle of the salty Carribean! Where's the well? Go back to the first paragraph. 	 94 K people packed on a tiny island. Add who knows how many drunken tourists.Turn up the heat. Now let nature kick in with everyone shitting and pissing. Where do you think all that festering sewage is going to go? Nowhere! Fortunately the Arubans came up with a plan. It involved little green and silver 22cl cans."
"Had this in bottle. I was super excited to try this because of all the great reviews I've heard about it.		Holy jesus christ... ""double chocolate, coffee, oatmeal stout""?! I don't think that's enough...let's try to cram some more crap into this beer! What a flavor overload, and not in a good way. This beer was just way overwhelming for me, and as usual, way over hyped by snob-, erm, beer advocates. This was the most bitter thing I've ever tasted in my life...the taste alone made me almost gag and puke, and subsequent smells from from the glass tickled my gag reflex.		It's just too much of everything in this beer. PASS."
"12 oz bottle poured to Duvel Green tulip.		The appearance of this beer will be very memorable. Pours a very appealing ruby red with a tan-ish 2 inch head that leaves some of the best lacing I've ever seen. 		Smell is of tropical fruits, pine, and dry hops. Everything you love to smell in a DIPA, but everything is too subtle. I was expecting a robust smell from a beer of this magnitude. I thought they would have to do a lot to cover up the booze, but I thought wrong.		Taste has a big malt backbone. It starts juicy and fruity with your typical mango, peach, pine , and grass. Then it is finished by the booze and extremely floral hops. There is something in this beer that is offensive, but I can't put my finger on it. Almost like tap water that has too much iron in it. 		Mouthfeel is too creamy. Extremely low carbonation. The consistency is of a creamy Imperial Stout. I am having trouble getting this down.		Just not really into this one at all. Won't seek it out, but like always I'm glad I tried it."
"A-Pale golden yellow. Small head which leaves a soapy slick atop the beer. There is a steady stream of bubbles but no head. 		S-Not much smell to speak of. 		T is more of the same. Slightly bitter. Not much different than other mass produced euro light lagers. Defininite metallic twang. 		M- is seltzer like. Sharp bite to it. 		DJust uninteresting and boring though inoffensive."
From a well-chilled half-liter bottle. This poured like a textbook dunkelweizen ... hazy and orange-brown with a solid, stoic head of white foam. I need a flavor identifier to help me pin down this aroma ... wheres the wife when you need her? I dont always want her around when Im breaking out new bottles in my beer room, but this is an exception. Its like a mushy overripe banana or a caramel banana split without the ice cream ... hard to describe. The first swish is incredibly disappointing, I cant tell you. Much more watery than you can imagine. And that same odd essence in the aroma comes thru in the flavor ... cooked banana chips, dark brown sugar, exceptionally sweet. (#2676, 2/2/07)
"A couple of buddies and had a bottle of this from the same 4-pack. I should've known to stay away from import beers in green bottles, but I felt it was finally time to try the fabled Urquell.		My friend best described our experience with the following: ""It feels like I just drank sweaty socks"".		The beer had gone bad and the only thing that convinced me I was actually drinking a Pils was the color and the head.		They say that somebody who has a skunky beer needs at least two years before they will try it again (even if they know it was just a bad bottle). Perhaps I'll rate this again in 2010."
They advertise this as the beer drinkers light beer. I don't know what they are talking about.  This beer starts promising, with a nice amber glow, and moderate head. It quickly falls short. The flavor is bland, and somewhat spritzy.  I just doens' t have much flavor!
"Had this beer on tap at a place called Mahogany's in Latonia, KY. Very much let down... I'm hoping that maybe there was just a bad batch on tap as the overall scores for this beer seem to be around the B+ range and I""m pretty sure mine's going to come out lower...		Appearance: Dark, no light was coming through at all. There was about a 1/2 finger of tan head that looked a little chunky, so the appearance was nice enough. The head disappated into the same ring around the top that so many other stouts go to. Not bad.		Smell: A little malty and a bit of bitter chocolate in there. Not smelling anything bourbon like at all... Sigh.		Taste: Light in the malt departmnet, slightly bitter chocolate in there as well. A very mild touch of alcohol as it warmed a bit. But again, like the smell, I taste no bourbon... Sigh.		Mouthfeel: Frankly, this was watery. Leaves a slightly dry coating on the palate as it goes down. Nothing to write home about.		Drinkability: Sadly, very low because I was let down by the beer. Overall, it was actually pretty easy to get down, but hey, so is a lager and this should have been a bit more of a challenge."
"Pours light pale straw yellow with a white head that has decent retention.	I have had this beer numerous times and I don't remember getting as strong skunk smell as I got this time. Probably some grain and corn husks in there but the skunk dominates.	Taste is thin, slight tart and dry. 	Mouthfeel is also thin, watery.	This is a pricey beer and on a value scale there are many light beers at half the price that are every bit as good and in many cases better."
One of the better light beers out there, but that is still not saying much. Fully golden but practically without any head/a bit soapy if anything. Very fresh, lightly citrusy nose. Naturally rather light-bodied, not much malt, but a small, short, dry finish. And again some weak citrus in the flavors. Actually a rather pleasant surprise.
"I have tried desperately to like this beer but to no avail. I find the smoke to agressive in the bottled version but somewhat better in the draught. This review is for the bottled though and first impressions are of a deep brown beer with coffee head which looks most appetising, the aroma is quite exceptional as the smoked malts dominate promising much. But for me the let down is the taste, far too assertive almost throat ripping smoke... this must be what it is like to be in a burning room. 	Several beers later the taste of Schlenkerla still dominates to the extent that it spoils them.	Sorry, I know it's a great beer but it's not for me."
Has a Smokey barbecue aroma, with a smooth mouthfeel. I tasted almonds and subtle hops. After trying the Weizen first I was thought that the Urbock would follow suit and be disappointing. Well, I wasn't greatly impressed. I did find this brew to be much smoother and less aggressive in terms of that Smokey flavor. This would go well with a burger or barbecue
"On-tap at the Lucky Shag in Perth, against all the warnings from my friends.		Pours a bright golden colour, extremely clear with a fine head of white and firm sheeting lacing. Large-bubbled carbonation and a watery, light body. Can't say I'm overly impressed.		Nose is bready and yeasty, with some sharp, earthy Pride of Ringwood. A little crushed undergrowth, but mostly, it's incredibly bland.		Taste is sharp with woody, dirty PoR and horrible mucky yeast after tones. Finish is bitter and acrid with chemical sharpness, and the texture of soda water. Urgh.		Even by the low standards of Aussie macro lagers this is bad. Bland but offensive all in one."
"The liquid looks average but the head sets it apart. Deep copper/caramel color with a large whispy off white head with decent retention.		Different nose on this. Full of herbal spicey qualities. Very green. Coriander and asparagus rule, fennel, with some tropical fruit nuances. Much is going on in the nose but not in a delightful manner for my liking.		Well the beer is solid. Not nearly as green in the mouth although still herbacious. Menthol, fennel, starfruit, pineapple, tangerine, pomeganate, coriander, caramel belgian yeast, and mango. Complex but lacks body and depth. I'm not crazy about much of the yeast and spices in certain belgian and belgian style brews and this is one of them which hurts drinkability for me."
"Very pretty dark gold with a decent white foamy head...didn't last too long though, and no lacing.	Very little smell of any kind...slight citris 	Mild flavor, citris with a hint of caramel popping up in there. A sourish, bitter finish.	Decent carbonation, feels right, nothing distinctive.	I could drink another, but won't."
From a clear bottle. Golden clear beer with a thin white head. Firts nose of brown sugar...in a pale lager...caramel afterward. Sweet taste, no hops, round, somewhat discusting aftertaste. This is not a good lager, it's hard to brew lager, this one is not dry enough, bad mash temperature, and maybe the fermentation temperature was too high.
"Dark ruby red. Very clean. A quite beautiful beige head, beautiful hat.	Red fruit, with a strong maltiness.	The taste starts fruity, sweetish, but not too much.	Belgian style. Again red fruit, on a good malty base.	Not too bad, with a sweetish note in the back.	Average body. Fruity aftertaste."
Some wheaty sourness, some earthy stinkyness, which was almost appetising, something was definitely fishy in here, salty, some sulfur and dirty nappies, actually quite interesting in the end, even though the flavours didn't blend well. (Cask GBBF 03')
"Chilled bottle into a glass. Thanks, Arne!		A: Pours a pale golden body with slight amber highlights. Short-lived beige head. No lace. 		S: It's earthy and slightly vegetal (I suppose I could attribute this to the pumpkin) with only a mild spice presence. 		T: As the nose goes, the taste follows. Earthy, even mildly fruity -- I'd say hops have a slight edge in the flavor. Somewhat vegetal, with a slimy and oily back end. Mild on the spices; only some nutmeg is noted. 		M: Light-medium bodied. Kind of slimy. Coats the mouth, but it doesn't leave any enjoyable flavors when it does. 		O: I think I sampled this out of a growler last year, but I must have thrown away the notes. I obviously didn't hate it, as I make it a point to upload reviews of beers I detest. That means I must have enjoyed it. I'm not sure what the difference is between last year's growler and this year's bottle, but this was fairly horrid and no one finished it. Maybe it's old? Off bottle? Who knows."
"Poured from 25.4 oz bottle into glass. ***Note: It doesn't give the ABV on the bottle, but several websites have it listed as 10% - review is based on that assumption.		From notes:		A- Miniscule head disappears quickly, and we are left with a glowing copper. No carbonation visible.		S- Smells sweeter than many IPA's... a bit llike fruity candy. Light apricot and peach, maybe a bit of tangerine. Very little hop scent here. Not sure what to expect...		T- I'm getting the apricot from the smell, and a hit of booze. You do get a fair amount of hops in the aftertaste, but they feel... Dull. The best way I can think to describe the taste is ""flat."" Shortly afterwards, the aftertaste is predominately warm alcohol. Considering the ABV, it isn't as boozy as some in this range, but it doesn't mask it terribly well either. I'm all for BBC trying something new and differing from the ultra-hoppy DIPA blueprint, but this one doesn't bring much to the forefront to take their place.		M- Some carbonation may have helped ease this beer's taste. Medium body. Dry finish. Nothing here to help the taste.		O- Allow me to say that I really enjoy the majority of BBC beers. Also, DIPA/IIPA are among my favorite styles... It seemed like a winning bet, but unfortunately this is one was a bit of a disappointment. Not the worst I've had, but I will not be getting this again. This was the first of a series of 25.4 oz BBCs that I bought at my local store... Hoping the other styles are better."
"*I hated it and will never taste it again.. thankgoodness*		app: looks normal and ok, sept this dont look like no quad at all.		smell: belgian candy smell, but a bad one. very lite and fruity.. a touch of a medicine nose.		taste: OH NO!! this is not good at all. the booze taste like cough syrup flavoring.. it all tastes very fake and off.. fake candy belgian sweetness, fake booze flavoring.. I would not be shocked if it were all artificaly flavored. way to sweet, not depth or complexity. upset.		mf: why do i bother. this feels like bad beer.		drinkable?: NO!! I can not even fake it!"
"12 oz bottle poured into a nonic. 		Thin, clear rose amber color with a pink frothy head with streaky lacing and little retention. Aroma of sweet cherry, like a pie, not much of a hop presence. Moderately thick mouthfeel, little carbonation. Taste is like cherry pie, sweet at first and then a slight tart finish. I don't know, nothing remarkable, certainly not as high quality or complex as the rubaeus its replacing in the lineup. The finish lingers with a slightly stale taste that makes this less drinkable for me."
Bottle. Pours a clear amber mahagony reddish color with a 1 finger light tan head that settles to collar around the glass. Malty, biscuit, and slight dark fruit notes in the nose. Maybe a silght touch of banana or bubblegum in the nose as well. Sweet, slightly roasty, orange, with a slight bitterness in the end. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, not bad, not outstanding but drinkable.
"500ml bottle bought from GapWines, Belfast...		Poured a pale straw yellow colour with some light coppery tinges... White head pours quite tight and thick then fades to almost nothing... very sparse carbonation... no lacing...		Aroma - Very sweet malts, corn notes, light biscuitiness, some sweet almond / marzipan notes, light spicy fruits (lemons, some pears), faint creamy vanilla hints, some boiled rice, faint cloves, some peppery hops...		Taste  Quite sickly sweet maltiness, creamy, sweet almonds, watery boiled rice hints, dishwater, no real fruitiness - maybe just the slightest traces of lemons and apples, some sea saltiness, faint peppery hops... overall pretty poor...		Feel - Quite sharp initially then some smoothness.. Light bodied... Much too sickly sweet to be in any way drinkable - i could barely finish one bottle...		Overall - A poor strong lager... nothing really to recommend it..."
"A malty, fruity aroma rises graciously from this dark, oily, shiny black beer. When I poured it, I thought crude oil. However, when I held it to the light, there were some dark purple and red hues that existed in the darkness of this porter.		This is a very heavy beer. The roasted, malted flavors dominate - almost overpower some of the subtle flavors in this beer. I picked up on some plum/prune flavors, as well as some flowery flavors (that seemed to hit my nose, rather than my tongue, while drinking).		The body is very slick - it almost rolls off of the tongue and down the very back of the throat. You think you may have missed tasting it as it slips by, but then its exaggerated aftertaste powers you into tasting submission.		This is a great porter - if it is the only beer you are drinking for the night, and if you are splitting it with someone else. This beer was a lot to handle - drinkability is marked appropriately."
"O.K., The CANQuest (TM) is officially having some O.K. beer. Actually, it makes me tear up for my old drinking buddy, Stash, of the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern. During his lifetime and my extended tenure in Da 'Burgh, he and I plowed through a LOT of Polish, Baltic and eastern European beers. He was the owner and dedicated to such beers. He never had it in a CAN, however. He was all about bottles, but I am finding that to be wrong-headed. CAN you imagine ""Woody's All-CAN Bar""? Ho!		From the CAN: ""Full Pale Beer = Piwo Jasne Pelne"". Yep.		I never appreciated the auditory aspect of The CANQuest (TM) as much as I do today, following a (mostly) ten-day hiatus. Crack and Glug, indeed! My two fingers' worth of rocky, bone-white head began falling almost immediately, but in exchange, it left some nice lacing. Color was a deep-golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. ""Pale"", my butt! Comparatively, historically, sure, but for the style - negits. Nose was pure, unadulterated lager. A slight, malt-driven sweetness led the way, but there were also Noble hops as the back-up. Mouthfeel was thin-to medium and I got a slight metallic tang on the tongue along with the initial wash of malty sweetness. Oh well. Finish was more tangy with the hops accompanied by a metallic taste. I CAN live without that aspect of some lagers."
Presentation, 40 oz. bottle, little foam in the bottle. Typical 40 oz. malt liquor. Smell metalic, alcohol, and sugary. It takes like a normal malt liquor, full of alcohol and various other flavors such as numerous grains. St. Ides has a little sugary tastes, makes it sweeter than others. Mouthfeel not that bad and not that good either. Drinkability, nothing that horrible about St. Ides, but mine tasted a little od. Other than that nothing that special and nothing that bad.
"12oz picked up in trades (sorry I don't remember everyone who has sent me one of these, I promise I am keeping better trading notes now.) Poured into my red wine glass and am still listening to Sasha's Involver mix.		Hazy muddy orange pour... waaaay to big of a head. Lacing is good.. but nothing even remotely great.		Bazooka Joe bubblegum, banana and harsh Belgian yeast spicyness dominate the nose.... sugar syrup with lively fruits.. plums... plums... a little bit nutmeg. Alcohol is hot... If it was warm enough, I could set it on fire.		Flavor is candy sweet... Hefeweizen banana and cloves... too much, way too much fruitiness... I normally need a little sweetness to tie together the Quad flavor nuances, but this is nearly off the charts. Mouthfeel is heavy/thick and cloying... I've been sitting on my last bottle of Bad Habit for close to a year now (thinking that time would do it well) ... My notebook reviews show the same disdain... although, this review is not nearly as bad as when I first had it back in January. I wrote, ""Bad Habit needs a recipe reformulation and this bottle needs a LOT longer bottle time"". That being said, I would really like to score another 4-6 of these and not touch them for 3-4 years."
Deep golden body with lots of effervesence, topped by a thick white sustaining head that leaves a good amount of lace. Slightly bitter malt aroma with hoppy accents and a touch of caramel. Bitter hoppy flavor with a little maltiness and some caramel notes. The finish is bitter and slightly hoppy. Light to medium bodied and slightly sodalike.
"On-Tap.		A- Spite pepper has that pale ale look, light golden tan with active bubbles seen rising. Not to much of a head on this just some bubbles that create a faint skim on the top, no lacing.		S- Wow, this really smells like pepa straight out of the kitchen. Big doses of black pepper and I guess some more varieties. A little underlining yeast with a trace of malt. It's really difficult getting anything else out of this besides pepa.		T- A straight blast of pepper right to the tounge that engulfs the mouth. It really takes charge while anything else that this beer may offer is out the window. Heat and habenero with some yeast on the tounge as well. Im not a huge fan of pepper, so im not a huge fan of this beer, basically because the pepper is huge. Did they do this out of Spite?		M- Im rating this a bit higher because in the end it does what a pepper ale should and that's deliver heat. The heat is felt on the tounge and down the hatchet. Im not really picking up any pale ale qualities to this, a bit one demensional. Light bodied with a bit to much carbonation as well.		D- Glad I tried it, but I wont be going out of my way for this one again, and that's not out of spite, it's because I just cant handle this beer. It probably would go well with cooking up some spicy dishes though, so it's got that going for it."
"Pours an orange beer with a massive amount of white chunks (yeast?) throughout it. If you left a beer next to one of those old school radiators for like, 3 years, this is what I'd expect it to look like. No bottle dating obviously, but it was an extra, so not like I had choice (and I feel bad for looking a gift horse in the mouth and all, but what can you do?).		Had a slight hoppy, but more yeasty aroma, give it some leeway and call it a belgian ipa I guess.		Taste, whoa, this is not good, no hop mouthfeel, just a gritty, yeasty, chunky, overcarbonated experience. Did not taste infected, just like it was aged a few years. Don't want to call it a drainpour, because the back half of the bottle was nice to cook the bratwurst in. 		Love their stouts, despise their ipa's. . . is it a freshness thing? I dunno. When I go back to PA later in the year, I'll try and score a bottle and see what happens. Until then, I'm sticking with Boris and Doris."
It pours with a nice caramel color but very little head and lies a bit flat. It had very little aroma, basically nothing which was disappointing. It has a decent caramel, malty flavor with a satisfying finish but not the best by far. Its drinkable but not something I would recommend or purchase again.
"Appearance: Clear, yellow body with a thin, white head.		Smell: Big floral and citrus scent looming over a very thin, very light malt character.		Taste: Rather light pale maltiness that fails miserable to provide any sense of balance to the hops. A flash of flowers and Meyer lemon before the strong bitterness. Long, bitter finish.		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation. Very faint stickiness to the mouthfeel.		Drinkability: No thanks. A beer that's altogether lacking in the malt department and relying on hop bitterness in lieu of hop flavor holds little interest for me."
"The last Macro Smackdown was the first to venture outside the borders of the U.S. It was, however, still confined to North America. MacSmack VIII puts on its traveling shoes and pits Amstel Light against Beck's Light in a titanic clash of European lightweights.		Medium amber with several vigorous bubble streams leading up to an eggshell white crown that actually looks pretty good. This beer is a bit darker than Beck's and its head is darker as well; more cream than bright white. A little lace ends up sticking to the glass.		The nose is of husky grain with a whiff of hops (that I don't think I'm imagining). It's the more powerful and the better of these two. Keep in mind that 'powerful' and 'better' are strictly relative terms.		This is not good beer. Too many light lagers are flavor deficient. However, when they aren't, and they taste like this, I wish they were. Amstel Light tastes more like a BMC product than I would have thought possible. The flavor profile consists of stale grain with an artificial quality that causes that telltale sign of bad beer... the involuntary grimace. When I can't keep the corners of my mouth from turning down, I know that I've entered the land of the truly wretched.		In terms of mouthfeel, each beer's positive is canceled out by its negative. This one has a slightly more full mouthfeel, relatively speaking, but a much fizzier carbonation. Let's call it a draw and move on.		I didn't expect much from Amstel Light in spite of the fact that it's 'the #1 imported light beer in America'. Actually, that last sentence would be more accurate if I changed 'in spite of the fact that' to 'since'. The winner of Macro Smackdown VIII has been crowned (largely due to a lack of any serious competition), but it wears that crown uneasily. Not recommended."
"This was my first time trying anything from this brewery. Decanted from a bomber bottle		A - poured a deep orange color with a 1/2 inch of head, no real lacing		S - no big hop aroma, a hint of pine? the malt aroma came thru more than the hop		T - had the bottle not said IPA I would have thought it to be a pale ale		M - ok		I checked BA for the overall score before I bought it. This beer was very disappointing to me and I didn't finish the bottle. Maybe I got an old brew which would explain the lack of hop prescence. (no date on bottle) I won't buy this again but might try it fresh on tap."
"Carling is Britain's best selling lager. Its website proudly boasts using the finest ingredients to create this brew. After years of shunning it, I have decided to return... for what in retrospect has turned out for one last sip.		Cooled ice cold (as reccomended) from a 500ml can in to a pint glass. I must say the appearance was okay. Not too pale, with a mild autumn leaf tone. Almost no head retention - light watery foams disappears after 5 seconds.		That was the good bit. The taste and mouthfeel were absolutely terrible. It's so fizzy, it's hard not to burp it all out almost instantly as you've drunk it. And it has the same taste of what beer tasted like back in those university days. Like a mixture of stale tobacco and cheap sluts. Or, it tickles a part of the brain that those memories are stored in. 		It's rare for me to pour beer down a sink. But that's what happened.		Drink out of curiosity - it'll make you appreciate better beers."
"*Review from 9/5*		A: Deep honey orange with a huge head. Very hazy and tons of carbonation bubbles ripping up, tons of floaties. There are so many floating chunks that its a little unappealing. Lots of sticky lacing. 		S: Thick carmel malt and sweet apple. It pretty much smells like a carmel apple. Not really getting any sort of hop aroma...weird.		T: Lightly sweet toffee malt, bread malt and then the bitter hops smash through and take over. Some hop spice/pepper notes as well. Almost a tart sourness near the end. Pine and very bitter floral hops in the finish that makes the mouth dry.		M: Lighter body and very carbonated. Fizzy bubbles tickle the tongue a little too much.		D: Poor drinkability because of the extremely high carbonation which is very unfortunate. 		I'm not sure if there was something off with this bottle and/or it was just extremely old. It was my first offering from Hoppin' Frog and hopefully my two bottles of BORIS that I brought back from Myrtle Beach will not disappoint the way this one did."
"Founders Breakfast Stout on tap at Bob's Bar in Columbus, Ohio. 		Appearance: Very dark brown, almost black. Faint head that dies quickly. Thin lacing. 		Smell: Coffee, roasted aromas. Not as strong as taste and mouthfeel. 		Taste: Coffee and more coffee. Did I say coffee? Cereal, some chocolate. Mild bitterness, high acidity (from the coffee, of course).		Mouthfeel: Low carbonation but full flavor. Medium body. 		Drinkability: Low. There are some Imperial Stouts I can chug. This is not one of them. I sip it and find it hard to drink. I like it better on a bottle. On tap, unbalanced, pungent, too coffe-y."
"Appears a bright copper amber when poured into my Allagash chalice, off white khaki off white head forms thick after a vigorous pour. I can tell the body is a bi viscous after the pour and carbonation has a hard time keeping up with the loads of malt and hops pushed into this beer. Fine even speckled patterns of lacing with each sip form on the sides of my glass. 		Aroma has a strong assaulting onslaught of hops going on including fresh cut green onions and strong aromatic citrus peels. This reminds me a lot of Green Flash DIPA, a bit of pungent Mary Jane and tropical fruit tones blend in as well. Alcohol comes through amongst the wave of hops, malts do back up the hops but this one has potential to burn nostril hairs. 		Flavor has an abusive level of hop bitterness and flavor. Raw herbaceous hops collide with booze to provide quite the unbalanced beast, which is what your going for with a Triple IPA. Hop pellets loads hit the palate with Grapefruit rinds, pine, and more green onion. It almost numbs the palate, so much that the balance between the malts and hops is completely abolished even in the hoppiest brews around I love for there to be some harmony rolling between the barrage of hop bitterness/flavors with the malts and alcohol. This one hits me with the booze and hop abrasiveness, and that pretty much sticks around. My palate is shot for further drinking and savoring of any other brews for the evening. Really not an enjoyable experience going on here.		Mouthfeel, this brew numbs the palate with hop bitterness and alcohol burn, it doesn't hide the 10% abv at all this is a booze bomb. Between those two abrasive qualities it doesn't make for a pleasant experience, carbonation I have no complaints with but the alcohol burn in my nares and on my breath doesn't do it for me. There are plenty of DIPAs out there that have the same alcohol without the abrasive fusel quality. 		Drinkability overall is pretty poor too damn extreme for it's own good, throwing loads of hops and malts doesn't always equate to good beer. I love most of this small brewer's efforts but this one most definitely strikes out with me, at a beerfest a couple years back I drank silk porter ran through a tower of coffee beans and it was mindblowingly drinkable and flavorful at the same time."
12 oz bottle. This pours a ruby hued brown color with a 3 finger light tan head over top that falls to a full coat over top. Clarity is very good and there is little to no carbonation. The aroma is lightly caramel sweet and moderately nutty, but over-run with diacetyl butteryness that borders on offensive to me. I recall that they use ringwood years here, so this is not a big surprise. The flavor is a little better. There is a solid roasted character that moves to a more mild sweet caramel and finishes with a mild earthy hop and bitter. This is much better than the aroma. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. I am really not able to move past the aroma on this one. It just rubs me wrong to have that much diacetly. It is nice that the roast malt helps to cover this in the flavor, but it doesn't save this one for me.
"22oz bottle into a perfect pint. 		A - Hazy auburn, pours with a huge pillowy three fingers of head with nice retention. Rings of lacing down the glass. Very nice looking.		S - Not as hoppy as the illustration on the label might lead you to believe. And ugh, it has a vegetative quality to it that just does not work at all for me, almost like leafy greens. Some sweet malts also lurking around the edges. 		T - Luckily not very similar to the nose. It's definitely on the sweeter side of IPAs, with plenty of bitterness from the hops but not a lot of the flavor that I've some to expect. It's okay but nothing spectacular, just very average. Not much in the way of detectable alcohol. 		M - Thick and full-bodied. Long dry finish. Definitely one of the best aspects of the beer. 		D - ABV isn't too high, but the aroma and taste just aren't doing it for me. I doubt I'd reach for another. 		O - Very much a mixed bag, with some great attributes -- look and feel -- and some bad ones. Unfortunately this beer fails for me on the keys -- smell and taste. I know Caldera can do better."
"Had on-tap at Capone's in Norristown, PA. I had been feeling like a rauchbier for awhile, so I had to grab this one while I could. Poured a clear orange-yellow color with pretty much no head to speak of. No lacing. Had an aroma of smoke and sweet malts. Very underwhelming nose. Tasted of caramel and sweet malts with smoke throughout. Not very complex and actually just generally weirdly balanced. It was almost like the rauchbier characteristics were an afterthought and this one was really intended to be a pale ale. 		Light-bodied with good carbonation. This one was a miss for me...a good attempt but not well executed."
"Well Younger35, you can't win them all.		The picture of Gandalf the Grey as a hillbilly farmer on the label should give it away. Pours a brownish brackish like the marsh lands frodo crossed with Sean Astin.		Smells cloying and sweet? Redundant, Gollum Gollum.		Tastes sticky icky sweet and alcoholy, like a pint from the green dragon and the bartendress that samwise gange eventually marries. 		Aftertaste of stinginess, the beer turns blue when orcs are near. 		I can see how some people like this beer, for me, it's like Mordor where the very air you breathe is poison."
"As 2.0 rating states: I am not impressed with this beer. All the halmarks and attributes of a barleywine with too much spice. If you thought of aging it, like I thought, would mellow it you'd be as wrong as I was. It was less 'hot"" with the fusel alcohols and the burning sensation but still fairly heavy spicing and a little sharp in the palette. Nice color, good attempt but if you're looking for Founder's best this is no the one to try."
"Appearance: Yellow-orange, transparent, with a thin white head that sticks around. Nice. 		Smell: Sweet, malty, slightly nutty. Hints of yeast. 		Taste: Syrupy sweetness up front with a bitter back-end. Harsh. Slightly cloying. Hints of yeast. Leaves a dry aftertaste. Disappointing. 		Mouthfeel: Thin, with somewhat heavy carbonation. 		Drinkability: A disappointing example of the style. I usually enjoy Stoudt's, but this Oktoberfest isn't one of my favorites."
"I've always seen this beer as more a gimmick than anything else but have also respected the Black Sheep name and since nothing else stuck out today at the store I decided to go for it. Decent off-white head retention on top of a golden amber body. A surprising waft of sweet apple hits the nose along with a little hop and not much else; almost more of a cider smell. 		My first sip shows a large malt profile and strong toasted notes drowning out the fruit and hops I was expecting to at least detect. Metal also sounds in early and often, which is unfortunate, almost like the knights soaked their swords in this beer for a week before it was bottled, not cool. The aftertaste in particular is rubbish. I really wanted to like this beer but I wont be dropping four bucks on this stinker again."
650mL bottle. Alcohol is listed as 4%, and not the 5% in the stats here. Pours a nice cloudy light straw with quite a bit of head. Aroma is tart. The initial taste is rather tart - almost metallic in nature. In the end, it settles down to being quite lemony. The taste stays relatively sour throughout. The aftertaste is not particularly pleasing. This isn't really my cup of tea, errr, beer, but at least it wasn't the bland lager I was fearing it might be.
"This beer is like Marzen extremely smoky.	The smell is mostly smoke with notes of wheat malt.	The body is dark golden with a light brown head that stands for a long time.	The taste is smoky with notes of fruit.	The mouth feel is sparkling.	I personally dont feel that the mixture of wheat (fruit) and extreme smoke goes well together."
"Another ""light beer"" ...great, pours pale clear golden color with a small white head that doesn't last, no lacing either. Light bready aroma, mild flavors of bread and grains, light bodied with a thin and light mouthfeel, good carbonation, it does have a crisp finish. Not much going on here, no more light beers please."
"Bottle with no date poured into a tulip.		A: Looks very nice. It has a smallish white head that retains fairly well atop a slightly more reddish body than I expected for an IPA. Leaves decent lacing.	S: Caramel dominates with some fruity notes. Smelling almost like a barley wine, and it makes me wonder initially if too much crystal malt is being used in the grist... Later in the drink earthy notes come through.	T: Sweet caramel and toffee hit first, with grassy notes hitting the palate shortly thereafter. A healthy dose of bitterness finishes. Decent, and more of an East Coast IPA as I was expected more hop flavour... Still the grassy thing isn't doing it for me. If this is 100% Cascade (as the label claims in french), count me out.	M: Light carbonation, feels crisp though as the bitterness balances the sweetness nicely.	D: Grass? No thanks. Disappointed as I bought this after having had their excellent Bitter."
"I noticed that this is Brasseurs & Frres' best rated brew here on BA and was excited to find it on tap at Brouhaha in Montreal after not seeing it anywhere in bottles. 		This beer initially makes a good impression; opaque and black, thick creamy head with good retention, though not much lacing. Pretty impressive look for a stout of 4.8%. 		The only other beer I've had from this brewery smelled overwhelmingly of corn on the cob, oddly enough. Sadly, whatever it is they do over there at Brasseurs & Frres, they seem to do to all their beers. This one also smells like corn; although with the addition of smoke this time. Smokey corn. Not good. 		What's up with the corn-on-the-cob at this place? Tastes like an average stout with corn juice in it. Yuck. 		Decent mouthfeel, although it's hard to notice under the corn fiesta. Medium bodied...nothing special. 		If I have a hankering for some corn, I usually cook some corn. I don't really appreciate it in beer form. I'm not sure what's up with all the corn beers; do they really brew with corn? If not, it would actually be quite impressive to achieve such an accurate roasted corn flavour. Undrinkable; I left half my glass at the bar after attempting to choke down as much as I could. I'm confused as to the great reviews here. Sometimes I'll chug a shitty beer for the buzz, but at 4.8% this one was definitely not worth it."
"From winter brew tasting notes (2010): Pours red orange, slow carbonation. Good head, nice crown. Nose picks up earthy, musty amber malts. The flavor is sweet, English-style malts, very sugary. A tinge of cherry. Turns earthy and musty at the end. Not a ton of character. The palate is light-bodied; creamy finish. Definitely a step down from the old Stoudts Winter Ale."
"Meh. 	Dark golden body with a head that was quick to become very thick, smelled deeply of yeast, slight acidic fruit, a weird musty smell and little hop. Again the taste was musty, a strange, gross yeasty taste with little malt body to balance that out and very little in the ways of hops to give it any spice.	Meh."
"Ah, ""the beer drinker's light beer.""	Has color.	On the nose it offers steamy, sweaty cereal aromas.	This is not combining well with the Red Seal Ale I just drank. The two together are creating a distinctly fecal impression. An evil transition. I swallow several times to clear the former beer from my palate. This beer smells and tastes exactly like a box of Rye Crisp crakers. Watery, sunny mid-palate impresions of honey and dried grass give way to dense, rye craker, wax paper and cardboard.		Husk water."
"This is a mild and washed out version of the style.		Pours amber with a disappointing head. The aroma is sweet, a little peaty, with an unfortunate bite of elastic. The flavor is sweet, slight, and malty with a band-aid finish that is not appealing. The mouthfeel is prickly to an unpleasant degree."
"A - A very dark red with a one finger tan head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving delicate rings of lacing behind.		S - Elderberries, chocolate, coffee, cherries, some smoke, raisins and dates. Alcohol is detectable.		T - Metals (iron), sweet currants, chocolate and a bit of coffee. These mesh to create a very slight blood flavor that I don't find very appetizing. The iron flavor lingers for a long time as well as a bit of a sweet mocha flavor. Without the iron flavor this would be delicious.		M - Viscous and smooth. There is a slight drying in the front and tounge of the mouth (seems to be a side effect of the iron flavor), but the very back is well refreshed. A little strange.		D - Well, I can't session it and it is too sweet for food. I'm not going to hunt it down in the future either. Finishing one is not difficult, but it is a bit of a chore with the blood and drying character. I guess that it is sub par in this category."
"I was very dissappointed after plopping down $9 for a bomber of this DIPA. While it says the IBU's are 168, I never tasted the bitterness I crave from a good IPA or DIPA. In fact, the malty overtones seemed to overpower the hops and bitter aftertaste. 		It is a big beer, but just not on my radar after this tasting"
"I had to step back from this ESB and wonder, is this a bitter at all? And according to the bottle its brewed in Fredrick, Maryland for this Pa. brewer. Whats up? 	 It pours a creamy copper amber with a slightly tan, well carbonated head that fades quick. Lace in spots at best. The aroma is malty sweet with hints of strawberry. The taste is sweet caramel, toffee with a thick over the top buttery toasted malt. I find little to no bitterness or hop to balance this beer. I find the drinkability hard for its just too sweet. My score--not inpressed by this Lady."
This was really an unimpressive beer in my opinion. When poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass, it had very little head and lacing. The body was a somewhat dark, cloudy reddish, brown. The smell was somewhat pungent, but still a little sweet and malty. The taste was a little bit of the same as the smell (but as I can't taste bitter and my friend told me that this was VERY bitter), there was a little bit of a sharp taste to it with a rounded out matly and hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel was pretty thin. Oveall drinkability is kind of low due to the fact that I couldn't find many redeaming qualities about this beer. I am very partial to things from Kentucky, but this beer isn't one of them. I would tell others to pass on this one.
"Poured into a stout glass.. 		A: Dark, dark brown with a one finger tan head that quickly disappears entirely. Pretty underwhelming start.		S: Have to almost stick my nose into the beer to get much of a scent. Just some oak and a touch of bourbon.. little else.		T: Like some other reviews, I get a metallic taste.. normally I'd assume it's just a bad bottle, but I'm not nearly the only one to notice this unfortunate characteristic. I do get good maltiness and some of the oak and bourbon, but just kinda blah.		M: I expected this to be thick and have great mouthfeel. Instead.. honestly.. it is thin and watery. What an AWFUL mouthfeel for an imperial stout! FAIL!		D: Considering how watery it is.. it's drinkable, but not if I want to enjoy the taste.. which, of course, I do. So yeah, never having this one again."
From old notes. Had out of a glass beer mug. Pours a dark orange with a thin head that disappears fast. Smells sweet, like caramel and roasted grains. Tastes sweet as well. There is no bitterness that I could detect, nor any real hop characteristics. Anything the hops add is lost in the dominate sweetness. Lots of warming alcohol is present though. Better than any other beer I've had from Latvia though, I guess.
"7.1%ABV 500ml can, lets hope I enjoy it more than the bottle I reviewed back in 2008.		The can had a best before of 27 Apr 2011, it was reviewed two months later: poured into my Budweiser Budvar 0.2 litre tasting glass on 23 Jun 2011.		No complaints from the look, bright, clear and golden. Lovely white head on each pour of the three.		Grainy, metalic type smell, but strangley not offensive.		The taste is all about the alcohol, with a drying bitterness that I didn't really take too. There is a hop mini feel in the flavour, but it just didn't seem to do much taste wise.		I could see two pints of this giving you the mother of all hang-overs. It's the sort of beer drunks drink out of brown paper bags!		As unimpressed as I was with the bottle, but for completely different reasons: have my tastebuds changed, or has the beer?"
"Yellow color. White head. So and so... 	Smell: nothing. Some malt. Pratically without smell. And anonymous.	Sweetie taste, malt (?). Bah. In any case, too sweet.	But why drink this one? Let it.... 	Nothing to say. Macro lager.	Drinkable, if there isn't anything else. But in this case, water is better."
"Lightly hazy, bronzy brown-red in hue with a coppery twist. The liquid looks pleasant enough but it does seem too clear and light in color for the style. Maybe Im judging a book by its cover. The beer was very foamy, over three fingers of slightly off-white head. The head retention was fair, it slide to a fizzy cap. There was a massive amount of clumpy subsequent lacing. No matter the flaws, it still looks better than average.		The nose is frail, nutty with a trivial caramel malt underbelly. Airy. I am not digging the aromas. It really lacks depth and power. Poor articulation as well this is Scottish? Says who? Not this beer! I didnt find the bouquet to be inviting.		The palate is very thin unbelievably so. Nutty. Caramel. Fusel alcohol supplies warmth and even some spice. It is weakly fruity (cherries and berries). Mild sweetness, the palate lacks depth and the flavors are not rich or well developed. Every flavor spike is disjointed. The finish is clean and empty. Good Scottish Ales give off a relaxing, charming vibe. Not this one because this is not a good Scottish Ale.		The mouthfeel is pitiful, light in body, thin and way too carbonated. I guess I would call the mouthfeel fitting because the nose and palate were equally as poor.		This beer is not drinkable. It is not worth a damn. At $5 a bottle, this is a onetime purchase unless I can be convinced my bottle is old and the next is very fresh but this beer just entered the Omaha market so I assume the retail got new beer. I purchased my beer in Omaha. Not recommended."
This is a tripel style brew right? At least the color is spot on, a hazey honey, medium amber. But this supposed tripel lacks the head all togeteher, carbonation and lacing. There is none, period. The aroma is ok, right in the middle of the road. Mlaty sweet, hints of KY candi sugar and some hints of light sweetnes fruits in the nose. The taste of all the good tripels I've had before this is the great carbonation that helps to bring out the sweet flavors of this brew. But there is very little in the way of palatable carbonation. Some light fruits and strong malt, but it means almost nothing whenther is no carbonation spritzing up the palate. The flat palate of this supposed tripel kills it for me. I'm never going to buy this beer again.
"A: Pour is pale amber with a rather small white creamy head. Slow dissipation leaves decent lacings.		S: Sweet malt with a hint of corn. Grassy and a bit grainy. Where are the hops???		T: Sweet caramell malt, slightly roasted. Bitter hops and some faint citric notes. Actually pretty nice flavours, but man they are mild.		M: Long bitter aftertaste. Body is light and carbonation medium. 		O: Well, weak smell, weak taste (eventhough there was nice parts in the taste) and rather watery. The only good thing was the aftertaste. Since I didn't pay that much for this can - you'll get what you pay for!"
"This was about the only beer on my cruise ship that I hadn't reviewed yet, so although it's not something I would normally spend five bucks on, I had to review it. I tried this brew in the Schooner Bar...my favorite bar on the Enchantment of the Seas.		A - Clear, light yellow, dull with a decent but short lived one finger head and some soptty lacing. A swirl brought the head back to a finger.		S - Gritty and macro-lagery adjunct-laden nose. Peppery acrid sweat-like hops. Smells alot like Heineken. Pretty nasty aroma really.		T - Very faintly peppery with alot af saaz characteristics. The flavor is very weak, but shat I can taste is sour, funky, acrid, and peppery. This is not at all pleasant.		M - Medium bodied for a light lager, but still quite watery. Highly carbonated with an absolutely clean finish which in this case is a blessing.		D - Pretty nasty stuff. I haven't tried the full flavored Amstel, but I won't touch this light crap ever again."
"Hold the bacon with my eggs, I'll have a Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen!!! 		Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights and a thick tan head that leaves nice lacing.		Aromas of a Slim Jim over campfire with background hints of berries. 		Taste has a frontal assault of smokiness, but has a lot of nice subtle notes, including sweet caramel, berry sweet and light malts. Campfire smokiness lingers and lingers...		Mouthfeel is medium with nice carbonation, with a dry finish.		This is a situational brew to the tee! Very nice if you are ready for it but I could see a terrible review if you popped this at the wrong time. The immense smokiness in the nose and flavor leaves this as a situational brew at best.		This one needs a second review!"
"A: Slightly burtn orange. Head died almost instantly. 		S: Spice bomb. Smells almost like winter green from the ginger and allspice. Not appealing. Almost astringent.		T: Gross. So god damn spicy and then tail end boozy. Gross. 		M: Who cares at this point.		O: Awful."
Had it on cask and it was till pretty boring, thin and grainy, with some some light citrus hops, minimal bitterness. i mean, its drinkable and all, but its not very interesting. A very below average English cask bitter, a bit too light bodied and the palates a bit too thin.
"This beer pours medium brown, translucent when held to the light with a bit of orange around the edges and a slight head that leaves some lacing down the glass. 	 	The aroma is burnt caramel, cooked broccoli and a touch of manure. I hope it tastes better than it smells. 		The taste is watery burnt caramel with a touch of sharp rye. This is the bum steer of the Kirkland Signature lot."
Dark yellow color with a decent bright white head. The smell is slighly grassy, nothing major here. The taste is also grassy from both the hops and the grains, as well as the occasional aftertastes that nearly cider-like or even bile-like. The mouthfeel is average. There is just something about this beer that doesn't jive with me. It's reasonalbe, I'll drink it, but I won't buy it again.
Bottle: Poured a light hazy brown color ale with a small bubbly head with no retention and no lacing. Aroma of dry lightly bitter English hops is the only discernable characteristic. Taste is also dominated by light English dry hops with no discernable malt profile. It might be due to low carbonation but this beer appears to be stale. This was definitely not true to the style or anywhere close to being interesting.
pours a dark orange thick looking brooding ale with minimal head and lacing..the smell is strong its malts and caramel with some banana and vanilla bean smells the taste is strong its a malt driven ale with a strong alcohol taste almost to me like a liquor i detect some bourbon and toffee its thick ..the mouhfeel is full bodied malty and sweet with the b4 mentioned tastes and smells.founders is an outstanding brewery with many on my rotation.. this old ale is a sipper and not my style or preference..all though i can tell its well made its just not my thing low scores are due to this not the quality of this ale or the brewer
"I love Founders' beers and, despite the cost for them out here (I have to buy them in the Philly area), have never had any reason to complain once I tasted the product. The Blushing Monk was expensive (to say the least), but as it was from Founders, I figured it would be more then worth the price. To say I was surprised and disappointed would be an understatement. 		The beer pours a very red raspberry color with very little head and pretty much no lacing. On the nose the beer is very sweet smelling, reminding me of Hawaiian punch spiked with alcohol. On the palate this beer is nothing short of a disaster and I just don't get it. It sort of reminds me of a fruit flavored lambic, but it's much sweeter. The beer finishes with some sourness, but it's not enough to offset the sweet cool aide/fruit punch flavor up front. 		On the bottle I have, the abv. was listed at 12.3%. I only wish it were the 9.5% listed on this site as 12.3% was clearly too high for a beer like this. The combination of fruit punch sweetness, coupled with the alcohol, made this beer nearly undrinkable.		A very poor effort from this otherwise outstanding brewery. A beer to avoid IMHO."
"I was excited to drink this beer as I love DIPA's. I was not impressed at all. It looked the same as most Imperial or Double IPA's amber/orange with a puffy white head that sticks around. It smells very sweet, hoppy, grapefruit. 		The taste was not very good to say the least. Slighty spicy, very sweet, sharp alcohol flavor. The aftertaste of alcohol was VERY strong. This is not a beer for the faint of heart. Stoudt's should have done a better job hiding the booziness of this beer. The mouthfeel was great though, oily, hoppy, slick on the tongue.		Dogfish Head's 90 minute is the best DIPA I have ever had and I will continue to try new ones until I find a beer I like half as much in the style. This is not it... Not Stoudt's best effort."
"Pours clear, dark brown body with reddish highlights when held to the light, capped by mid-sized tan head that quickly shrinks to a soapy film. The beechwood smoke imparts pronounced bacon-like aroma that doesn't leave much room for anything else apart from the subdued malt-sweetness in the background. 	Medium body with medium carbonation has clean lager character and a good balance between the bacon-like smokiness without any harsh, burnt or charred flavors, Vienna-like type of malt-sweetness with toasty qualities and moderate hop-bitterness leading into the medium-dry finish. I prefer smoked malts with woody, campfire character over the bacon/ham-like, hence the low score for overall impression. (500 ml with freshness date June 2011, into mug.) 		In short: a sweet, Vienna-type malt based beer with bacon-like smoke character."
"12 oz bottle poured into Chimay goblet.		Pours a very flat hazy cloudy baby poop brown color. Decent amount of floating matter in the glass, and the tiny bubbles around the edge of the glass don't add much appeal.		The smell is very interesting after 6 or so years in the bottle. At first it smells like a cognac with nutty notes and cherry booziness. Then I get whiffs of pure apple cider. There is also a definite cardboard mustiness, but nothing really overtakes the surprising fruity booziness. Lots of apple, cherry, banana, and alcohol ester. 		Taste is downright abrasive and not in a good way. Rotten banana, booze, rancid cider, and wet cardboard. Age has not been kind to this one. This is the last bottle from the cellar and that is probably a good thing. I remember this one being boozy when fresh, but I am shocked at how boozy it still is. Booze and off flavors is all that is left here.		The mouth is flat and oily...definitely well past its prime. If Founders decides to make a quad again, I will most certainly try it, but this beer is happily retired."
"Pours dark, mahogany wood brown with a nice uniform light-tan head. Instant smoky overdose in the nostrils, like walking into a smokehouse. Very malty with taste is pure essence of wood grilled beef jerky. Hard to get over the thick smoke, but when paired with some sharp cheddar I changed my tone a bit. When I say ""paired with sharp cheddar"" I actually meant chased the fucker with four cheese Cheez-Its, but the flavor combination speaks for itself, just works."
"Ok, so I went to Maine and found this oddity from LITHUANIA (!?) and had to buy one. Out of the bottle this ""Belgian Style Dark Ale"" was a murky amber color with a frothy tan head. Moderate retention and some les than impressive lacing. The aroma was musty malt, slightly stale hop bitterness and hints of sweetness in the alcohol esters. The flavors started a little on the musty barley side, this then gave way to sweeter flavors of caramel malt but these too were a little odd. The aftertaste however was distinctly unpleasant, like tannins in wine - twiggy. The body was medium and watery, the carbonation too soft and as it warmed up the alcohol came right through it. I have trouble classifying it as a Belgian Dark Ale and really would not recommend anyone try it even for the novelty. Too bad."
"A: Pours a nice clear orange color, nice sized head with a bit of lacing down the glass	S: My first though is...this can't be an IPA. Doesnt smell remotely of hops. It doesnt smell bad, kinda smells like a spiced up Altbier or something. Very malty/sweet smelling also some spiciness in there as well. Also slight vinegary sour scent....thats probably not a good sign.	T: Sweet malt up front followed by astringent crushed asprin. 	M: Thick reisny full bodied pucker you up beer	O: This beer is pretty bad, I love hoppy IPA's but this is a drain pour sorry to say. I kinda wonder if this bottle was infected but I got it from one of the better bottle shops in Portland so you would think it should be fresh??? This is one weird beer."
"from the ""dugout"" 12 pack, best by 6/30/06		eyes...	full finger of nicely bubbled white head, lace is very nice and consistent like the ocean licking the shore, head retention is OK with micro carbonation hard to see inside the glass, pale brown hue looks clean and consistent. the stickiness and lacing push this just above average.. but it is more like 3.25 if ya really want to know...		nose...	like all the cooperstown brews this is dominated by the ringwood yeast smell of butterscotch, this one moreso than the others I have tried this evening. there is a nice under pinning of caramel malt but barely any perceptable smell of hops imo, a faint smell of alcohol is detectable. overall pretty average and nothing to great here, a faint roasted malt flavor can be pried out of the nose...		taste etc...	prcikly carbonation, the malt and yeast seem pretty assertive here, the bitterness doesn't seem to bite but lingers a bit in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good with the aforementioned carbonation, something is missing here... not quite sure what but this is lacking for me. it does have a nice bitter tone in the aftertaste but it almost comes off as unpleasant over the course of the beer.. something about this is just turning me off...		verdict?	I will revisit this with the other bottle I have as part of the 12 pack but if it is the same I won't be looking for this brew again, there are so many better american IPAs out there these days.. even on the mild side the long trail unfiltered absolutely slays this, and that isn't a hoppy american IPA at all... I can't recommend this one."
This beer appears quite nicely in a glass, red/gold in color with a decent head. It smells a bit nutty and maybe even a little sweaty(!?!?) The taste is fair, a little spicy with a dank after taste. Drinkability is okay, nothing to write home about though. All in all it isn't my favorite pale, but if its in someones fridge I'd have it. I am suprised that this beer isn't better than it is considering the amount of great beer that comes from the Pacific North West.
"Pours dark golden with very slightly off-white head and full of small carbonation bubbles. Aroma is malt with slight hints of alcohol and becomes very medicine-like towards the end.		Taste is light malt with distinct and even unpleasant herbal bitterness that lasts well into the aftertaste as well as notes of alcohol. Mouthfeel is light with excessive carbonation in the beginning that disappears very fast.		Overall, one of the best strong lagers around, but feels too bland and watery towards the end."
"i had this out of a 40oz bottle	i thought someone pissed in the bottle and re-sealed it	some chick that was hangin' said ""you need to mix that with fruit punch, you don't drink it straight""	i bought some fruit punch and did some mixing	wow, the fruit punch cut the nasty taste and i was able to get through another 40...	next day - my stomach feels like there's a knot inside it - i had the worst craps ever - no mas... ever!"
"Had this beer on tap at The Drafting Room Hopfest the other day. It was easily the worst beer I tasted.		The beer pours a striking orange color with good head retention and lacing. I have to say right off that it's a bit darker then I expect for a DIPA. I don't get a lot on the nose, just a hint of citrus with what smells like some seriously sweet malt.		On the palate this beer is nothing short of disgusting. The flavors aren't off, but this beer is so sweet, the alcohol and malt completely dominate the hops. This has to be one of the heaviest, most tiring beers I've ever sampled. The beer is medium to full bodied and is pretty smooth. As for drinkabilty, I couldn't come close to finishing just the 5 ounce sampler this beer came in. 		I love hoppy DIPA's, but the sweet malt and alcohol completely mask the hops. The beer tastes almost out of balance it's so sweet, malty and heavy on the alcohol. Granted, I know this DIPA is made in the so called East Coast style, so undoubtedly that's part of the problem for me (I prefer the less malty West Coast style), but regardless, this beer is just over the top sweet and boozy. Unless you are feeling particularly mascochistic, I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone.		7/3/10 edit. Tried this beer fresh and on tap at the Big Hunt yesterday. While marginally better then what I tried previously, the fact remains that this is a sweet, boozy, borderline unbalanced DIPA that is about as undrinkable as any DIPA I've ever sampled. Obviously, it's popular with some folks, but I'll be damned if I can see the appeal."
The appearance was the classic golden cloud of hefe-ness with a nice pinky finger head. It starts out with a pretty strong blueberry smell, it almost made me nervous to try it because I could smell the blueberry 2 feet from the glass. Don't get me wrong, i really did like the smell, very blueberry-ee. The initial taste isn't as sweet as you'd expect, with the traditional banana/clove taste trying to push through the blueberry. But at the end of the day, the blueberry wins in the aftertaste. I might try another glass(sampler size this time) if I find myself at Hog Haus again, but definately not worth a growler-full of it. You can only have so much blueberry.
"Pale gold, and as many of BBC's bottled brews are, overcarbonated. Watch for a massive never-ending head of foam. Pour with caution. 		Malty nose -- bread, soap. Not much there.		Taste is also overmalted, even syrupy. A little hint of bitterness at the finish can't save this very average beer. Hints at even being a little skunky, though my bottle was produced only 2 months ago. 		Messy, and very forgettable."
"On tap in a shaker pint. Near black with mahogany highlights. A bit of head, a bit of lace. 		Massively sweet and boozy nose, a concoction that's obviously malty but with some odd adjunct qualities. Holy mackerel, this stuff is sweet, a wave of malted milk and lemon-lime soda. Burnt and harsh woody flavors are in direct contrast rather than providing any sort of balance. Medium-thick with a lowish carbonation that does little to keep things moving along. By far the worst beer I've had from what is normally an enjoyable brewery."
"Almost has a coffee flavor to it. it tastes of brown sugar, ripe fruit, and a touch of woodsy smoke. I had a pint, but I couldn't have any more. I was really liking it, but it's one of those that's tough to have more than one.		The appearance was great, especially for a crisp December afternoon. A really dark, almost Guiness look, dark brown tone. It had a thin cap of caramel-colored foam, that really stuck around for the whole pint."
"Wasn't sure what to make of this 12oz bottle. Poured into a standard pint glass, I got a view of a brownish brew with pinkish tinges over which squatted an off-white head that collapsed into itself inside of two minutes. No lace but the head could be briefly revived by swirling the glass.	The nose was odd to say the least. Lots of caramel malt tones, some blackberry/boysenberry notes, and a mild peaty earth aroma that had a touch of smoke to it. All this just kinda banged around into each other without really working together.	This action carried on right over to the taste. Lots of toffee and caramel malt flavor up front. More berry sweetness and a dark earthiness akin to freshly tilled soil. Lastly a glint of peat-laden smoke, each flavor seeming to jam on the brakes abruptly and disappear as if to avoid being in the same vicinity as the next. The feel was light, thin, and muted.	Overall, I was barely able to conquer this brew. Pretty lackluster and dull; not something I'd go out of my way for."
"Appearance: Pours an opaque black body with a fading, light brown head.		Smell: Sweet-smelling, lightly roasted chocolate drenched in concentrated notes of leather, and alcoholic rum raisin.		Taste: Flavors of light chocolate and blackstrap molasses unfortunately are obstructed by a fierce, cloying sweetness that is tough to overcome. The oversweetened taste is close to becoming unbearable. Nothing but alcohol and a further spoonful of sugar on the finish which leaves an icky, viscid aftertaste.		Mouthfeel Medium-bodied, with a saturated syrupiness. 		Drinkability: For the most part, this beer was all alcohol and sugar. Finishing the 500ml bottle was a hard-won battle. An appallingly syrupy beer with no redeeming qualities. I much preferred the Sinebrychoff Porter and Duck-Rabbit's Baltic Porter over this mess."
"Brought from Sofia by my kind Bulgarian flatmate, who was assured by the shop assistant that this can of Amstel was ""brewed in Bulgaria""! Well... sounds special for this Dutch lager. At 5.0%abv., BB 10/05/09, served chilled in a straight pint size glass.		A: a semi-lively golden body comes with a white cottony head with o.k. retention.	S: semi-sharp sweet maltiness with an edge of burned sugar, malt candy, grassy touch of hops, light honey, a faint sourness of a lager, plus an unusual tinge of prunes... A bit weird for a lager - any lager. 	T: very fizzy upfront, then the weak taste of malts turns lightly grassy with a medium-level of hop bitterness manifesting itself slowly at the back of the palate... Don't know how to make of the taste, apart from that it's pretty... neutral. Finishing with light sourness as well as a metallic touch.	M&D: the palate comes slightly too fizzy and becomes a bit watery in the end, although the body doesn't fall too thin overall. This Bulgaria-brewed Amstel is a pretty bland offering, but I thank my dear flatmate for her kindest gesture all the same!"
"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 1 pint 0.9 oz bottle into a pint glass. The label lists the ABV at 5.5% and there is a brief description on the back. 		Appearance: The body has just the slightest haze and a light amber color which was darker than I had expected. There is also some visible carbonation that makes its way up to a slightly off white, two finger tall head. This head quickly settles down to a thick ring of foam that leaves no lacing on the glass.		Smell: In the nose there are notes of old apple skins and some bready grain. 		Taste/Palate: The flavor is full of old oxidized apple and apple skins with bready and buttery pie crust notes. I am also picking up some odd papery or cardboard like flavor notes. Hops are barely even noticeable and offer no bitterness at all. The finish is quick and fairly clean. This is all offered up on a light to medium body that started out with some crisp carbonation and then quickly faded to a dull lifeless slick feel.		Notes: This is not a beer that I would seek out again."
For a brewery that tries so many styles that I like, I am amazed how bad their beers can be. Didn't know this was a Trafalgar brew until I opened it and was worried right away. I got no aroma from my heady pour. Dominant taste was metal. The little bit of flavour of the bitter is ruined by the metallic tainting. This was from the OCB mixer and will just reinforce my decision to avoid Trarfalgar.
When first poured, the color was a slightly haze golden yellow, with very little foam. Then, after the first smell, it seemed that this ale had a lot of promise. The smell of mild hops and a fruity aroma filled the nose. Then it was down hill after that. The taste was just of a sour/tart/bitter and not a lot of hop flavor or any fruit what so ever. After each sip, all I got was the sour/bitter/tart taste on the palate with very litlle flavor of anything. Blah! One more gulp and down the sink!
"500ml bottle purchased at Jim's Homebrew in Spokane for $2.77. I thouoght I was buying the porter. I just now discovered it's the Mocne instead. I'm super pissed.		Poured a moderately clear gold color. Moderate white head that dropped fast.Fair amount of lace.		Polish Heineken, anyone? That's what I thought when I smelled this. The first impression is that of skunkiness. Beyond that is the scent of floral hops and mildly sweet malt.		Taste is a little better than the smell, but is still nothing to write home about. The taste begins with a mild, sweet maltiness, then shifts to a floral hoppiness that ends on a dry note. All is accompanied by a background skunkiness.		This is a medium bodied beer. There's a lot of fizziness to this. I don't care for it.		I suppose this is ok compared to a Natty ice or something along those lines. But that's like saying Stalin wasn't as evil as Hitler. There are much better choices out there."
"Bottle sampled at a beer tasting event. 		Poured an amber light red hue, slightly opaque. Decent head, some lacing and good retention. 		Nose is grain, sour grapefruit and cherries, and a funkyness I can't really identify. 		Taste is a pretty uninteresting blend of pilsner, cherry juice and grapefruit/citrus. Cherry soda beer. Not really sure what's going on here, but I can state with confidence that whatever it is, its not enjoyable. Even the folks at the tasting who ""don't like beer"" were turned off by this.		Slightly overcarbonated, medium-thin bodied.		Yet another beer from Trafalgar that profoundly disappointed. Not worth it for either the ale or the cherry aspect. Will not pick up again - if someone asks for a cherry flavored brew, I'll tell em to stick with Mort Subite."
"16.9 oz bottle poured into a giant snifter, and now I'm stuck with the prospect of finishing it.		Bright golden with medium head -- doesn't look bad. However, it smells like Budweiser concentrate + everclear.		Taste is sweet and lagery with an alcohol and unpleasant sour aftertaste. It seems to get worse as I drink it, which is directly opposite of most beers I drink.		Mouthfeel is OK, slightly filmy, very light and effervescent.		Not very drinkable -- I'm not looking forward to finishing it, but it's not so bad I feel I should dump it out.		They're very proud of how strong it is. It has a big hanging tag on it advertising 9.5% ABV. Good for them."
"This was ok, but did not turn out to be my style. I got this after reading some rave reviews for Budwieser Budvar, the Czech beer Busch named its best selling brew after. I couldn't find Budvar (or Czechvar in America) just then, and Urquell is its main competitor, so I got that instead. Plus many people here said Urquell is better anyway. It didn't turn out to be that great for me. The appearance is very pleasant, a golden amber with a substantial white frothy head. The bottle is nice too, I like the green and I think the foil adds a classy touch. The smell was very interesting, and I could detect some grass and even some floral aspects. The taste and mouthfeel were a letdown though. There's medium malt, not much yeast, and very strong hops. This is I think my second beer with Saaz hops, and I do not appreciate them. My problem with virtually all hops is that they generally fall into either the catagory of the almost non-existent (see especially American macro style lagers, but including some better ones like Saranac Smooth Lager or Killians Irish Red), strong and disgusting (skunked beer and Bud), or overbearingly bitter (Urquell, Sierra Nevada, Saranac Aiderondak Amber). Very few beers use hops with my ideal flavor profile which is balanced with some bitterness and a complex flavor (See Sam Adams, Yuengling Traditional Lager). Urquell uses the bitter sledgehammer and I don't appreciate it. There are definately some subtle and enjoyable things going on in the flavor if this beer. But the hops crowd it out. And the mouthfeel and drinkability further suffer because its kind of on the thick side. Of course, by this time, fans of Urquell who are reading this review are probably going ""That's what real beer is like idiot! Sorry its not another tastelss Macro lager from Milwalkee or St Louis"". Now that'd be a pretty fair thing to say, but I have 2 counters. 1, If your hops are good enough I'll put up with the bitterness. These are close, but not quite there. Strong bitter flavor doesn't make a good hop by itself, at least not for me. 2, Isn't pilsner supposed to be on the light side and thirst quenching? If they really are, then this is not true to the style. Except Urquell is supposed to be the origional pilsner. So my conclusion is that pilsner in general is overhyped. Just because its got an interesting color and a new hop doesn't make it the class of the world. Then again, this was still a good beer and a fairly interesting beer even if I thought it had its faults."
"Got this as part of a sampler, in a tiny (3 oz?) serving. 		Pitch black appearance with a nice but thin tan head leaving moderately heavy lacing.		Strong aroma of black fruit. Smells like wine, with a hint of espresso. No chocolate or caramel in the nose.		Tastes like it smells: winey, boozy, fruity. No malt. Very thin mouthfeel, otherwise nothing notable.		Drinkability is poor. Didn't even finish the sample though I could have downed it in one swallow. Not sure what's in this, but it doesn't much resemble beer. It needs a lot more of everything, except maybe fermentables. More bitterness, more roastiness, more body. Sorry, I don't enjoy your stout."
"Was very, very surprised to find multiple 4 packs of Nemesis at one of my ""local"" bottle shops. Grabbed a couple for aging purposes, and figured I might as well crack one open while still relatively fresh.		Murky orange pour. A very aggressive pour yields a thin halo of foam, which was expected. There's a pretty fair amount of sticky lacing on the inside of the glass, though its stay is short-lived.		Aroma is very, very sweet, and dominated by bourbon. Sweet maple, sweet vanilla, even more sweet bourbon, and maybe some sweet brown sugar. Wheat? I don't smell it. Warmth doesn't really add complexity. It just adds boozy heat.		Flavor is about the same. Tons of sweet flavors, and solvent-like alcohol. Sweet heat, all the way. I will say, though, that there is a nice hop bitterness that wasn't evident in the aroma, and provides a much-needed extra dimension to the flavor. 		Nemesis is full-bodied, and very viscous. Slick and chewy, with a dry, boozy finish. Drinkability? Uh, not great. Not a drainpour...Thorn telling Rabbit to ""Well, finish it up"" after a syrup chug victory in Super Troopers comes to mind, somewhat appropriately. We'll see what age does to these...a rare miss from Founders."
Thanks to tuo for the trade. 12oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in my Old Stock snifter. Poured a translucent golden/burnt-orange with a quarter inch, loose, off-white head that quickly dissipates into a soapy skim with some bubbles around the edges. Some lacing, but weak legs. Nose screams heat - alcohol, bourbon, buttery/lightly toasted oak and a suggestion of maple syrup. Yikes - tastes like slightly watered down bourbon - not at all what I expected. There is definitely a hint of maple in the mix, but it is quickly overwhelmed by the alcohol. If I didn't know this was a beer, I would have guessed it was a spirit. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a mildly assertive carbonation and a slight viscosity. This could easily be split three ways, and I'm a little sorry I opened this one by myself. It's slightly caustic and difficult to drink solo. Age can't do anything but improve this beer.
"I will attempt to try every Founders beer available in VA over the next week. Here we go..	what happens when you mix gold and rubies? This beer. Very little head, ring stays around the edge of the snifter. Smells like sweet caramel malts and cherries. Not much complexity, but it's nice. Cherries are bigger in the mouth, but not overwhelmingly cloying/syrupy. Almost there, though. Bordering on new glarus territory, but within the realm.. I'd've liked a little more tart cherry flavor, there is a bit, but most of it is drowned out in the excess of maltiness. Pretty good, split a bottle 2 ways and probably won't need another for a while. I bet it would make a great dessert companion, though. Maybe with some tiramasu or chocolate."
it's funny how mediocre a one time favorite can taste after you've delved into the world of craft and micro brews. for a mass marketed light lager this is pretty good however. light straw in color, slightly hoppy smell which doesn't really transfer to the taste. overall very little taste which quickly vanishes into the watery aftertaste. this is a good beer to order at a restaurant when all you want a light import to wash your food down with. i think that's what i'll be reserving it for.
"Appearance: Pours a ncie meduim golden color with a wispy, bone-white head.		Aroma: Somewhat sweet nose, with a somewhat grainy focus.		Taste: Lots of carbonation supports a fairly weak palate. Some hops and malt, but nothing distinct.		Mouthfeel: Thin and slightly watery. Short palate with a nonexistent finish.		Drinkability: Quite ordinary, with nothing special to show. Won't try again."
"I thought I'd at least try this without reviewing, but I feel compelled after tasting. It looks like a decent dark beer, but the the description of the smell is not easily broken down into the choices given. It's anything but average, but to some I'm sure it's wonderful As aromas go, I'm sure this is a very good smell for smoked beers. It just happens to be my first and I'm a bit shocked. 		The taste is that of the liquid at the bottom of the pan from when you've baked a nice, juicy smoked ham. I'm not sure if I'm appalled or intrigued. I keep trying it again to see if it really tastes as it does.		It's a non-offensive mouthfeel. It tastes like my hair smells when I've sat around a camp fire for hours.		Drinkability? I'll drink it. But I feel like I should be eating beef jerky, too. Maybe it would be nice with a full country breakfast."
"Brown 33cl bottle, best before 9th Jan 09, drank a month later, Feb 09.		Poured into a 10 inch Harboe badged vase shaped glass (twice because the glass only holds 30cl).		Dull old gold in colour, with no head after the initial small white covering.		Malted barley is the first aroma to hit the nose, but that slowly dissapates to nothing and a wheaty, alcohol smell takes over.		Very little taste, just some alcohol and wetness. Medium carbonisation, but very bland and undistinctive.		I brought back quiet a few beers from Copenhagen after the 1st European Beer Fest last year (2008), none have lived up to my expectations."
"8oz. tap pour at Founders into a snifter.		(A)- Pours a thick & syrupy pitch black color that momentarily cascaded as it was pulled from the tap right in front of me. Produced a rather frothy & fluffy very light tan head with some good retention to it. 		(S)- Tons of butterscotch, molasses, vanilla, toffee, and coffee. Man, this is rich & malty!		(T)- Very decadent & rich malted chocolate shake with toffee, butterscotch, cocoa, molasses, raisins, and caramel mixed into it. The slightest bitterness from hops, and a slight roasted component mixed into the various elements. Very sweet but is a rollercoaster of flavor. They said it was an old ale, but its really like that only combined with a stout and a barleywine put together; crazy!		(M)- Great carbonation level to it. Rather thick & very sweet tasting; its almost to the point of being too much, but not quite. This screams dessert beer in every sense. 		(D)- A sipper meant to be savored after dinner as a special treat. Very sweet & rich but not in an off-sugary way; Tons upon tons of malts in this! I would love to see this bottled just so I could age it to see how it would change cause this has alot going for it, but it really fills you up with its thick & rich body."
"Pours slightly hazed with a foamy head that pops down to a thin layer. 		The smell is of caramel, grainy, a bit musty.		The taste is of buttery caramel and some mustiness. The Ringwood yeast shines forth. Some hops are in there to add some balance, though not quite enough. Some vague fruitiness is there as well. Not enough is going on to control the yeast. Finishes with an annoying sweetness. This is certainly more of an English-style Pale rather than an APA as categorized here, IMO. And not a very pleasant one at that.		It has some body and flavor does hang on a bit, though I don't know how good that is in this case.		Well, it's not drainpour, but close. Pass."
This beer just strikes me as way to carbonated. This gives it a bit of a bight I would not expect from a British style ale. The carbonation is what makes me give the this beer lower marks. The bite reduces the drinkability and gives for a sharp mouthfeel. I terms of taste it's got a nice malt background. Not much in terms of hops though.
"Poured in Sam Adams glass		A - Rich golden yellow with rocky white head which lasts. Amazingly clear for a hefe. Double check that there isn't any sediment in the bottom of the bottle; there isn't.		S - Grainy and bready malt aroma. Mild (very mild) banana esters with a mild spicy German hop aroma. Smells more like a pilsner than a hefe.		T - Very bready, sweet malt flavor with mild banana, but seems to be missing the associated phenolics. Spicy German hop flavor and bitterness that lasts long afterwards.		M - Moderate carbonation and smooth. Dry finish. Refreshing.		D - A well crafted beer, just not a very interesting beer or a good example of a German Hefeweizen. Tastes more like an American Wheat to me. In my opinion this is the worst one out of the Kirkland Signature set. Still, considering that the case is $21, I'd say it's still worth buying the case for the other three beers."
Reviewed on 06/04/2009. Bottle at PPRBSG09. Pours a clear brown with a very small head. Aroma of vegetal notes, prunes, and raisins. Flavor is equally vegetal and gross and rather boozy (although apparently I am the only one to dislike this beer so much...oh well).
"Just opened a fresh 2010 bottle.		Tasted like Bourbon + water; like a mixed drink instead of a beer. This is the first beer from Founders that I didn't really enjoy. 		I've heard it gets much better with age, so the rest of the four pack is going into the beer fridge, but I am sorely disappointed as I tried hard to find this four-pack."
snifter. slightly hazy amber color, orange to red. some sediment. slight off-white head. low retention and light lacing. sweet malty aroma, very barleywine-esque. some decent citrus hop aromas. big banana flavors with some clove. good amount of alcohol burn. sweet malts with tons of fruits. a little rough at 8%, but other than that it is a pretty good brew for Lithuania.
"I picked this up while in Indiana. Reviewed from dictated notes during my ""Clean out my cellar weekend."" 		Pours watery. Reddish hued dark brown. Creamy tan head is minimal, and after 30 seconds it is reduced to a wisp of small bubbles on the surface. Minimal lacing.		Smell is huuuuge roasted chocolate malt. Very little bourbon. Perhaps this is a blend bottle? 25% bourbon aged, 75% stout? A little caramel, coffee, and toffee hiding in there too.		On the first sip, you can't even talk about the taste until the mouthfeel is mentioned. This is the thinnest stout I've ever had. This is about as thick as drinking a cup of coffee. That is the mouthfeel. Extremely poor. The smell was great. It actually had me revved up to try this beer-- hoping that the thin looking body wouldn't mean it tasted watered down... The looks match the mouthfeel with sub-par results.		Taste is below average. Coffee and chocolate at the forefront, with only the very slightest hint of bourbon. Even then, it smells like mediocre bourbon.		As for drinkability--- I guess I could drink 10 of these... because there is nothing to it. Of course, I have no desire to drink anymore, and I am even going to pour out the last few sips of this one. So my ability to drink these is high, but my desire to do so is low. We'll split the difference with a 2.5 here.		I don't know what it is about being the first few reviews on a beer--- but there is a pressure to be more positive than is needed. Clearly the case with descriptions including, ""disappointing"" and ""watery"" still allowing for 3.0 for the aspect rating. This beer is sub-par. The only beer drinkers who will ultimately be impressed by this are people new to the bourbon barrel scene. And even then, I imaging the honeymoon period will be short-lived.		Overall--- the body and flavor need to be developed in a big way. A higher gravity and more time in the barrels to impart more flavor would be where I start.	As a consumer, I would avoid this one in the future unless they changed up the recipe a bit.		--01.23.11--	Had to bust out a bottle to prove that not EVERY BA beer is good... This is worse than I remembered... The drinkability and smell scores have dropped as a result.	Wow. 	If you have any, don't drink it. Just pour it out."
"It had a spicy aroma along with the a really nice size head. the body was clear and well carbonated, the bubbles exploded when they hit the air. 		Taste was of barley malt and bitter hops blending softly together. The bottle version was a little sweeter, almost sour and verry bitter!			. 	I dont Know if it was old, lightnigstruck, skunked, or that what the bottle version taste like!!"
"Cute little 8oz can shared courtesy of egajdzis.		Poured a lighter and clear yellow color with a small sized white head. Aromas of straw, grains, and grassy. Tastes of the same with some corn. Body and tastes on the watery side.		Notes from 09/26/08."
"Well, what can one say about ""The Original Pilsner""? Another true classic.		Appearance - a vigorous pour yields a head composed of fairly course bubbles, which quickly settle into a lacey cap on the head of the beer. The beer has a beautiful straw-colored hue, a bit darker than other beers in its class.		Aroma - Wow, this is a Zatec extravaganza. There is no skimping on the Czech's pride and joy in their hoppy history. Floral, citrus, spicy...the malt exists in the back there somewhere, but the hop character is the behemoth here. I sometimes wonder how this brew would differ if marketed in brown bottles, rather than the green ones which marketers seem to think catches the eye of consumers in a more effective manner.		Taste - well...the beer is SO hoppy it's a bit out of balance. If the hops were cut down just a bit this beer would be perfect. Unfortunately, what is obviously a wonderful malt character is pushed aside by the overwhelming presence of Saint Saaz. Oh well.		Mouthfeel - wonderful, creamy, milky and slides down nice & easy.		Drinkability - I can only take one or two at a time. The hop astringency just whacks my palate. I will mention however, that Pilsner Urquell on-tap is a bit more subdued with the hop character and I could probably pound it all night long. :)"
The aroma is something you either hate or love and I love it. It is very unique. The appearance is a reddish brown and the head is large. The flavor is well balanced. It has a sweet maltiness to go along with the bitter and smoke flavor. There is also a tang in there. The palate is thin. Overall it's smokey and it's not my style but it's interesting none the less.
"A: Pours clear yellow with a good amount of head, but low retention. Nothing special.		S: Revolting. I get generic mega-lager with strong hints of can.		T: Taste follows the nose. Big hit of aluminium. Quite unpleasant, and I get the feeling it's not a good beer (tasteless?) even without that aluminium taste. I'm not willing to buy the bottled version just to make sure.		M: Good amount of carbonation for the style. One of the only decent things I can say about this beer. It is certainly not a saving grace, though.		D: The only reason to get this beer is as a joke. It is, predictably, quite bad. One of the worst beers I've ever had."
"I rolled the dice on this despite my missgivings on buying mid to low ABV imports (just ain't seen many travel well past the east cost)		Pours a deep gold/light amber with a slight haze. Foamy white head drops to thin, but protozoa (sp??)-type activity on the surface.	Zero lacing.			Smell: Butterscotch and ever so slight fruitiness		Taste: Fruitiness, dryness and butterscoth diatechyl taste I rarely tasted in Germany. Slight hop bitterness on the tounge		MF: Thin and prickly. I am used to German winter offerings having some heft, no such luck.		Not terrible, but pretty dissapointing. This is why I stick to dark &/or stronger beers from across the pond. Would've loved to try this in Germany."
"I would love to say this was a great beer and support a local brewery but this beer is really lacking.		Dirty malty notes with a light hop presence of pine with a tad of fruit. Not terribly drinkable. For an american amber I would expect an assertive hop presence and a more complex malt profile.		As far as the hemp... I can't distinguish that it adds any noticeable flavor or quality to the beer.		Wouldn't buy again."
"Brown 33cl bottle, best before 24 May 2011, drank from a Duvel glass on 15 Mar 2011.		No sediment appeared to leave the bottle but the beer looked a misty/cloudy/moody dull orange colour, rather than the clearer, brighter body I was expecting: a weak wispy covering sat on top of the brew.		Sweet aromas of sugar cane candy and childrens sweets in general. Tried to find some beery smells, but failed.		The taste is a bitter sweet yeasty mix, the alcohol content very evident from the start. Strange flavours and mouthfeel to be honest, too sweet for me, and I like the sweeter Belgian brews normally.		Pleasant enough, but the heavy sweet overtones in all aspects were just too strong for my tastebuds."
"Also referred to as ""Stella Local,"" this is the Budweiser of Egypt. My sample, purchased and consumed in Sharm el Sheikh, came in a blue and gold can with a five-pointed star above the name in English and Arabic. Ingredients conform to the purity law (or, at least, the ingredients listed on the can do...). Best before 09/06, I tried it on 12/27/05.		Pours a clear light gold under a one finger white head that fades quickly to collar, leaving a few spots of lace. Metallic hops blend with sweet adjunct grain in the nose. The mouth is light and very prickly. The heavy carbonation overwhelms the tongue at first, making it impossible to taste anything. By the time the stinging clears, only metallic bitterness remains. A hint of espresso emerges briefly in the aftertaste. Overall, a bland macro product worthy of little respect."
On a bronze color, it offers a nose of bitter oranges where spices are present. The palate is spicy, at least as powerfully as the Binchoise Brune, and olfactory are present citrus mingle and cereals, sometimes quite strongly, but the conclusion of the tasting is just average, even despite a persistence that is in the throat long enough to have a good time.
"Theres something fun about aggressively pouring a 22 oz bomber of a wit or hefe when you want some yeasties! Cloudy gold color with a fine-bubbled white head and lacing is nice.		Nose has lots of spices to it...coriander for sure along with maybe even a bit of Grains of Paradise and cinnamon/nutmeg? Typically I like a wit to showcase the yeast and have touches of coriander and citrus, so I am not liking where this is headed, but lets see how it tastes...		Id be willing to bet there is some nutmeg and/or grains of paradise...neither of which I enjoy. It IS pretty dry as the label claims, not that much sweetness here. The citrus aspect is totally lost on me, I love a nice orange peel-orange flesh flavor...hell, I'll even take a good lime peel/lemon character if it fits alright. This thing is just kinda meh...I am ok with spending the 5 bucks for a bomber to try, but would not buy it again...like all Pike offerings I have tried unfortunately. Waaay too much spice going on and very little beer flavor, no citrus and lacks a nice soft feel of a good wit. I expect a lot more from a PAC NW brewery and Pike continually disappoints in a major way. Shame on you, Pike."
"9.3oz (275ml) bottle from Aruba.		Pale yellow gold with small white ring of head.		Smells almost entirely of skunked hops. Bit of sweet corn-like adjunctiness there also.		Wow, lots of ""dirty"" and skunky metallic taste for how little taste is here overall. Nothing ""clean"" about it at all. Sweet corn tortilla chips. Corona Light.		Rough, stingy carbonation, almost no body, ultra-light feel overall. Hard to finish all 9.3 oz."
"Got this at De Bierkoning in Amsterdam. 		From a bomber into a snifter. 		APPEARANCE: Pours a thinner looking one finger tan/brown head that makes tones of crackling noises. Poor retention, head dissipates very quickly and disappears totally. Dark brown and some carbonation in the form of little bubbles. Resembles flat cola. 		SMELL: Some smoky barley malt and mound so tobacco, perhaps even cigarette smoke. Hints of sweet caramel malt in the back and a faint touch of milk chocolate as well. Too weak to make a statement, and perhaps that's a good thing. I don't mind some tobacco aromas and flavors, but this is a little over the top. 		TASTE: Smoky and roasted barley malt and bitter coffee flavors compete with caramel sweetness up front, which was quite a pleasant surprise. The tobacco makes an appearance, which borders on the unpleasant. Aftertaste is strong and long lasting, consisting of bitter-sweet milk chocolate, bitter coffee and smoky tobacco. A decent taste profile actually; much better than the nose advertised. 		PALATE: Disappointing here again. Thinner body and, surprisingly, higher levels of carbonation. Mildly creamy going down, but carries too much air on the way. Finishes quite dry on the palate, almost too astringent. Not full or creamy enough for the style. A bit of a mess here. 		OVERALL: I could certainly finish this one, but wasn't necessarily looking forward to the next sip. A big disappointment. I had higher hopes for this offering, from a brewery I otherwise enjoy very much. Am also a big fan of porters as well, but this one just didn't work out. Reminded me more of a weaker Baltic porter that missed the mark. Too heavy on the tobacco, too boring a look, and too light and astringent a palate, this is one I won't be picking up again."
"660ml bottle poured into a pint glass. Thanks to pootz for this one!		Pours an almost opaque cola colour with some brown highlights when held up to the light. 1 1/2 inch tan head with lots of lace, good retention. Carbonation seems fairly high. Aroma is less smoky than what might be expected. Light smokiness followed by a bitter roasted coffee aroma. Light brown sugary sweetness in the back. 		Taste starts off with a good dose of lactic sourness followed by what I would describe as a granny smith fruity tartness, a little unexpected. Smoke is more pronounced in the flavour, but I still think I've found more ""smoke"" characted in some beers that weren't advertised as such. Hard metallic twang all over the mouth is a bit unpleasant. Subdued roasted malt with some molasses sweetness. I find this beer almost shockingly acidic though, I wish that this was more balanced. The flavour profile is one dimensional and messy for me. Aftertaste is all sour roasted malt messiness. Body is medium with a carbonation that's just a bit too high for my liking. Fairly dry and stringent and almost charred tasting in the finish, like eating burnt toast. I'm not a big fan of this at all, this bomber is going to be a tough one to get to the bottom of."
"Thanks to the 4-finger beer bandit for the opportunity. 		Open front slit, black cardboard box laden with fireworks & a significant write-up/explanation on the back side. Looks more like a really big New Year's Eve popper then a bottle of beer. :P		A cautious pour into my sampling mug, a stiff dollop of off-white head that eventually melts into a golden wheat colored body.		Smell is intense right off the bat. Not eye-watering hops though. A potpourri of soapy florals & fresh/sharp citrus rind. Orange & lemon oils seem to separate off a little. Invigorating, but a bit overly peppery.		On taste, juicy hops accompanied by sugary malt. Alcoholic, spicy, & a bit itchy. The massive list of ingredients condenses down into a perfumey herbal soap. Plenty of carbonation there at least, accelerating all the resin, & scratching at my sinuses. A lingering, green finish.		Too much of a messy potluck for me to really enjoy. Thin enough to quickly put down that I can see it working on some levels, but really not my idea of good stone soup."
"It was a product I never seen, and at an affordable price ($2.99 for the bomber) at my local BevMo. ""...it was amber. SHe was aglow."" Um, that label looks more like scarlet to me, but maybe the beer is amber. I'll pop the cap and find out:		The beer does look amber in color. A darker amber. There's some creamy lacing kicked up by the head, which is about a  inch thick. Oh, if only the nose were like the look. Overall, the nose is light in firepower, bringing to the table toasted toffee, a squirt of Cascade hop(?) juice, and a trickle of cardboard. 		Upfront there's hope that the flavor will be more intense. It doesn't happen, but it does have it moments. I'm getting this cured meat flavor, the kind that you would get in a rauchbier, as the beer settles in my mouth. Toasted biscuity malt is flashed, especially in the aftertaste. Vague fruitiness wiggle around. The carbonation seems to ""jump"" the beer's taste, which by itself (the taste) is weak. As it warms, the beer acquires a ""chemically"" character. The aftertaste of biscuity malt alone lingering in the aftertaste brings the taste score up one notch. 		The overall package is okay at best. Meh. I'll need to remember to lower my expectations should there be another meeting.		Quick update - the flavor is getting worse and worse the more I go along. Battery acid anyone? What started as decent is now in drainpour territory."
"12oz bottle, served in a pint glass.		A - clear, yellow/orange color with a small off white head that thinned quickly to a light layer leaving very little lace.		S - sweet, boozey smell.		T - sweet, boozey taste.		M - medium bodied, low carbonation.		D - one bottle, was enough for me.		Final Note: I usually like dubs, but I didn't really like this one too much."
"Poured from the 12 oz bottle, brewed in Maryland, not PA, a medium orange color with a large white head, big bubbles. On the nose was Munich malts, caramel, honey and no noticeable hop aroma. 		Taste - Very full and sweet, quite malty, Munich malts, caramel, quite rich and chewy. Mid pallet; a very light hop bitterness breezes through. Closes out with and almost cloying honey sweetness. Finishes very honey-sweet and smooth as silk. Carbonation was nice and low, mouthfeel was very slick and clingy.		Overall - A well crafted bock Stoudt's knows lagers. Full flavored and interesting for sure. Be warned - a lager on the sweet side and the addition of the honey was a big one. This beer has a strong honey presence and is quite sweet. I never found the honey character over the top, but it came extremely close. The only real drawback with this one was the high sweetness cut into the beers drinkability. After one, I could have had another, but my pallet was really craving something different to cut some of that honey flavor."
"One of the original problems for industrial breweries was that consumers' preference for ultra-pale, ultra-bland beer resulted in brews that could not generate a foamy head the way all-malt beers did. This stocky, super-retentive and ultra-white cap shows they've obviously found a solution. And I must say, it goes nice with the shimmering golden complexion.		But it sure does stink! Whatever chemical stabilizers were added to improve head retention and stability, they've really gone and stunk the joint up. Images of moldy processed white bread (if such a thing does go moldy) and giant stainless steel vats of corn syrup come to mind; this thing smells remarkably different from an all-malt lager. 		Okocim Pils taste like the last place entry in a deep south cornbread bake-off. It has a greasy, buttery texture and a terribly insipid flavour consisting of corn and bread. The aftertaste smacks of something very solvent-y that feels as though it shouldn't be in there and makes you slightly anxious about what you have just put in your body.		A wise thinker once pointed out that differences of degree do turn into differences of kind: pluck a man's hair out one strand at a time and eventually he'll be bald. Okocim Pils is a beer that has had all its strands plucked; it is a bald shadow of what a real pilsner is. And despite whatever mass market allure it may have, I personally find little appeal in drinking it. 		Now I know how the dog feels when we tell her we've taking her to the park and take her to the vet instead. Contrary to what this brewer claims, nothing about Okocim Pils is traditional or premium or, save for the appearance, even pilsner-like. It's not only misleading, but also disappointing considering these guys do make a few decent beers."
"Poured a light yellow with a quickly disappearing head.	The smell was of corn and vegetable oil.	This tasted like any other typical macro light. I think that it is the concept of ""imported"" that makes it seem better than the average macro light.	I think people drink this to give people the impression that they are drinking something above average when, in reality, it tastes the same as any other light macro. In other words, like nothing but vegetable with some skunk."
"Bottle form the OCB discovery pack		Hazy pale blonde, one finger of white head, some lace. Smell is grainy, malt, cereal and bread like, lightly grassy but all this is overshadowed by a vegetable like corn scent. Taste is malty, grainy, lightly floral, mild earthy notes and a light bitter finish. Fell is ok, med carb, med body and a lightish feel but not watery though. Well its not good but there is no obvious infection like most of the stuff from these guys, I finished the bottle but I will likely never reach for another one. It looked pretty good in the glass though."
Draught. Pours a fairly nondescript gold, small offwhite head. Towards the end of the night - lots of astringent, medicinal quality where the hops should be. Finish is lots of aspirin. I did not end up finishing this - part of it could be a lack of freshness, but I cant be sure.
"pours out a surprising jet black with two fingers of tan head. hey its a black barleywine! lacing is impressive. it looks like i am drinking FBS.		smell is fusel alchohol right away. hey its a big fresh barleywine, i guess i should expect it to be hot. subsides into beautiful pineapple and mango scents. 		taste is big impressive pineapple hops up front! amazing unique hop profile big pineapple flavor.	pineapple	pineapple	pineapple	then some roasted malt that is delicious and becomes more prominent as it warms. finishes hot and boozy not enough to be a huge flavor issue.		mouthfeel is lovelty big smooth, substantial, with just enough carbonation. much win here.		drinkability isnt great a big time sipper even witthout being hot and boozy. one is enough. also -		water : wicked witch = nemesis : your teeth's enamel."
Haven't met too many mediocre from this style, until now. Some fine wheat aroma, decent white colour. Acidic sour lemony offsets advantage of wheat. Medium mouthfeel, carbonation too strong. Not finishable. Avoid s doesn't hang together. Seemed fresh and their taps are humming.
"Got this bottle (BB date 01/12/05) from my Polish friend brought straight from Poland. Accroding to him, Palone means ""burned"". And this beer from outside the bottle does bear a dark appearance and might be a dark-lager? Let's see...		A: it pours a dark brown to mahogany colour, with a thick, fluffy yet foamy-looking off-white beer head. Reasonable retention.	S: a profound aroma of slightly sweetish roasted malts and lightly-charred wood, against a quite lightly-burned sugary note and an aromatic but understated Czech hop aroma.	T: the taste is quite brown-sugary and light-caramel at first; a very smooth and light texture of dark malts and light, sweet dark-fruit juice (like black-plum juice) follows through. The finish has just a little tinge of bitterness, with more malts and brown sugary mouthfeel at the back along with a faint trace of char--qutie simple profile really, for this dark beer...	M: overall the mouthfeel is very soft and overly smooth, and this is an easy-drinking and light-bodied dark lager at the expense of depth and a balanced structure--somehow going down like sugary water...	D: while remaining an easy-drinking dark lager, it lacks enough flavour and body to make it really enjoyable, hence the below-average drinkability."
"Reviewed 1/29/2009 (bottled Week 2 Sep):		Pours a very clear golden amber colored body, with a creamy white head, and good lacing. Has a pilsnery malty aroma. A pilsnery taste, grainy. I do not like that taste in my beer. Fresh but the grain taste turns me off."
"Not a very worthwhile experience. Poured flat and tasted blandish.	Thin feel and a real lack of substance or flavour. 	I've had a few other Trafalgar beers which were pretty decent, so I was surprised. I noticed another comment on the flatness, so I suppose some of the bottles could have not been properly sealed."
"Explosive brown foamy look. Chocolate and wood aroma with a lager background. Sharp bite, mineral, molasses, alcohol, and a dry wood finish. Tinges of metal creep up. Foamy and acidic feel.		I picked this up and it may have been sitting around in a distributor warehouse (it was an '09). It foamed up substantially but oddly, despite all the problems, I actually somewhat enjoyed it. Maybe it was because it sat so long the alcohol changed into a more potent hallucinogen."
This beer pours a pale straw color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes quickly leaving no lacing. The aroma is of nothing. When I try really hard I can detect some extremely faint malt. The taste is little easier to detect that the aroma, but it is still mostly nothing. The mouthfeel is light bodied with nice carbonation. It is actually pretty good for a light lager. Overall, this beer tastes too much like water for my likings. I will not be having this beer again.
"Very dark porter with ruby hues. Almost no head but it did have nice lacing.		It smelled like burnt cereal and chocolate, like most good porters, only the smell was really faint and almost soapy. It tasted pretty good, but not very strong, with strong essences of coffee and chocolate. Nice flavor.		If I had one complaint with this beer it was its thin, unsatisfying body. It was like I was drinking Bud Light. Its body made it hard to drink."
"A - HUGE HUGE head. Very gentle pour into pint glass resulted in about a 4 finger head. Orangish-brown in color and excellent lacing.		S - Somewhat sour in the nose with citrusy hops coming through. A somewhat funky smell for a DIPA.		T - A somewhat sour taste up front with a sweet caramel backing. The citrus hops begin to come through later in the drink and it finishes with a nice graprefruit and lemon bitterness. The taste up front is just way too funky for a DIPA.		M/D - Medium bodied and puckering to the mouth. The off tastes are just too much to make this real drinkable...especially for a 750ml bottle."
"Poured 39 degrees into a Dogfish Head bulbed pint. No born date.		Pours a lucid gold with a 3 finger white head that disspiates very quickly into a consistent cap. 		Smells of some urine, a hint of yeast and a tertiary sweatiness. Yummy.		Taste is a little bit smoother than I expected, but I wasn't expecting a tremendous amount. Slides over the palate with a thin dryness that ends up turning into a hint of corn on the drydown. Feels sort of flat already. 		Overall, probably a drainpour. Not much going on here in terms of identity next to any other light beer.		69."
"A-Pours a light chocolate color with a finger of white head.		S-Smells of huge notes of Luden's cough drops and Tootsie Rolls.		T-Sweet cherry and light notes of tootsie roll followed by maybe the slightest hint of bitterness.		M-Light bodied with a prickly, light carbonation.		D-Drinkability is pretty low for me; the elements of this beer that stand out are flavorings used with a weak base beer."
"Appearance: A solid two fingers to frothy head that retains and laces decently. The body is a typical Lager gold with perhaps a slight tinge of brown, however not much carbonation going on.		Smell: Really bad earthy skunk, with only the barest touches of grass in the background. It is also quite pronounced which in this case, isn't a good thing.		Taste: It takes just like it smells, as it starts with a sulfuric fizzy taste that turns into an awful earthy swamp taste. Not very complex, and frankly not very good. There are worse things I've put in my mouth, sure but this is not very pleasant.		Mouthfeel: The carbonation is way to fizzy, there is a severe lack of transitioning, the aftertaste tastes like dirt, and the only redeeming quality is that it thankfully moist to drink, washing away much of the unpleasantness.		Drinkability: Well, it does quench the thirst, but not much else. My stomach doesn't quite agree with it as it seems to cause some bloating. It's not easy going down, in fact it is a struggle.		Final Thoughts: Yeah...you will want to pass on this one. There are certainly better imports out there as I can't really see ever wanting to have another one of these ever again. It got drain poured at the half way mark. At least it looked nice."
I didn't know if I should label this a light lager, or an N/A. Because it's over 1%abv, I chose light. Rege's pour was almost clear. Their is more of a yellow presence than a yellow colour. Small head. Maybe a few millimetres? Sad. Smelled skunked and sour. Like sour candies with mould. Maybe not that bad, but close. No hop or malt smell. It all seems to be sour skunk. Terrible taste. Overcooked veggies and sour peach. I would not be surprised if any malt was used in this. It all seems to be vegetable adjuncts. Overall, undrinkable. The label is the best thing about the beer. It has a cobra wrapped around a bushel of barley.
"Thanks to THECPJ for the share. Review from notes 12/3/10.		A: Pours a deep copper color with an a 2-3 finger chunky white head that lasts for a very long time and leaves some nice lacing. Scoring the appearance turns difficult because there are large chunks of floaties in this one.		S: Little bit of citrus and some pine, but much maltier than usual for the style and the alcohol is pretty obvious. 		T: Has a nice tangerine flavor, but the alcohol is pretty present again, and gets stronger as the beer warms. 		M/D: Slightly lighter than medium bodied with good carbonation. The tangerine flavor was really nice, but the alcohol presence was a real problem for me, making it tough to get through."
Pours gold with a thick 3 finger head that slowly evaporates with little to no lacing. The only thing to say about taste and smell is overpowering cider. If not for the that, it might have a decent mouthfeel and drinkabilty, suprisingly smooth for the high gravity. If you like your cheap buzz drowned in ester, this is the best $1.79 you can spend.
"Pours a bright golden yellow. Two or three inches of white foam head.		Smells ... strangely like sweet malt and yeast. I actually checked to see if I had purchased the okocim malt liquor by mistake. i had not. 		Taste is, again, strangely sweet. A pungent, almost cereal-grain malt sweetness to it, and maybe just a hint of the earthy zest/crispy/sort-a lemony flavor I expect from a pilsener. Mouthfeel was strangely thick and ... gloppy ... rather than the effervescent mouthfeel of a pilsener. 		All in all, a weak offering."
"650ml bottle	5.0% ABV	I tried this beer on June 11, 2011 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a clear gold colour with a thin white head. The aroma is skunky malt, metallic hops, and other off smells. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour is stale grainy malt, and acidic hops, with a sour finish."
"I have an intense aversion to ""floaties"" (although I'm fine with sediment), and unfortunately this beer had floaties in spades, which damaged my perception of this beer. I bought it in Ohio from the refrigerated section of a briskly-moving store (a Heinen's in Strongsville) and opened it promptly afterwards. This beer has no date code.		Getting past that issue, this beer is quite good in other ways. Aroma is quite powerfully hoppy, with lots of quite crisp pininess accompanied by lesser notes of citrus. Flavor is very strongly bitter, yet not heavy or undrinkable. Mouthfeel was not heavy or astringent, but intense. This beer's bitterness conceals any hint of its alcohol content.		Minus the floaties (which effected the ""appearance,"" ""drinkability,"" and ""mouthfeel"" portions of this rating), this beer was good. The beer smelled and tasted good, but for a $6.99 bottle of beer, I was pretty disappointed with my experience with it."
"Presentation: It was poured from a brown, 1pt.0.9floz. or 500ml bottle into a pint glass.		Appearance: The body has a very dark brown color with some lighter brown highlights. Its head builds up thick and slowly settles down to thin cap that hangs on to the last sip. The head is tan in color and makes nice slippery lace that slowly slides down the glass as I drink.		Smell: Its aroma is strong and has a heavy sweet and fruity malt character with a very noticeable alcohol presence in the nose.		Taste/Mouth feel: The overall flavor is very sweet with a sticky, almost syrupy texture. Sugary sweet malt with dark caramel, molasses and toffee notes dominate its character. There is a very noticeable alcohol presence in the flavor and notes of cherry cough drop with some mild herbal and leafy hops. Any bitterness from the hops is overpowered by the extremely sweet malt however. It finishes slowly with its malt lingering on the palate. Carbonation is moderate to average and it's about medium bodied.		Notes: Its overall drinkability for me was low due to its unchecked and unbalanced syrupy sweetness. The alcohol had some ruff edges as well; still this is a very interesting brew."
"A: It looks exactly like a darker version of a cola drink. Carbonation not so dense.		S: It smells very sweet and soda like. Almost reminds me of the way certain Belgian beers smell. Malts. Faintly of alcohol.		T: Smokey, sweety and slightly syrupy. The sweetness kind of ruins it for me. 		M: Somewhat mouthpuckering due to the sweetness. 		D: I didn't dump it, but it's really not great."
"$2.70 for a 12oz bottle @ Jacks. 86 IBU's and 9.4% ABV per the label. No info on the website as of now. Pours out to a slightly cloudy light amber/burnt orange with peach accents, forming a tall sticky white meringue head with excellent retention and nice sheets of lace. Thin layer of least in the bottom of the bottle. Mild to moderate carbonation. The aroma is heavenlywith a boatload of skunky tropical fruit hops. There is skunkweed, mango, pineapple, grapefruit and pine in there...wonderfully full and fresh. Mouthfeel is smooth, sleek, with a dense body. The taste is as expected...boatloads of hops over a firm pale malt base, with a heavy accent on the grapefruit pith bitterness. There is an underlying sweetness and soft hint of vanilla which tries to regain balance to the very assertive bitterness. Alcohol adds a peppery flourish to the finish with a potent bitter aftertaste of pine sap. One bottle is gonna be hard to finish.		This is certainly well-crafted, but is honestly a bit much for my taste. I prefer my DIPA's a bit less bitter. I'd prefer HopSlam, Centennial, or even fresh Two-Hearted to this."
"Actually brewed in Holland by Dutch Export Breweries at the Grolsche Bierbrouwerij.		This is a simple, well more like a crude beer. Pale malt, heavy and sweet, like a barley-wine. Minimal hop presence. Most high alcohol beers suffer from the same thick, crude, one-dimensional sweetness. It's heavy and unpleasant like hard-core pornography or heavy metal music.		Is there a difference between something like Sierra Nevada BigFoot and this? Well, maybe there is - I prefer this shit to that shit."
"12/17, 8:40am, addendum: I just walked into my den, where I left the glass for this, and the *instant* I walked it, the entire room smelled like hops -- and maple syrup w/ a kick of fermenting wort. The glass was empty. Upon contemplating what this means, I guess ""smell"" isn't so god-awful. Points for staying power.		12/17, around midnight, original review: I've been drinking this for about 45 minutes, and I'm only half finished. See, I like just about every style of beer, and it's rare that I really dislike something, so this is probably not a good thing.		Tonight was pale ale/IPA night, and I decided to close with the ol' Devil Dancer. Snaps for the kick ass label.		But let's talk about the beer.		Eh...well...this kind of sucks. Sure, the shade of red is bewitching and matches the reddish label perfectly. But this doesn't even smell like a plant or fruit that gives the impression of hops like pine or grapefruit. This smells like someone dropped me in the middle of a hop field straight out of Little Shop of Horrors and the little bastards were trying to eat me alive. They're everywhere and allow practically no nuance to escape -- a fleeting, miniscule hint of resinous, raw evergreen. Then straight back to the raw hops. They're here to take over the world.		You'll have to pardon my anger. But really, I'm just pissed because my tongue is going to require surgery to recover. This starts with a sweet caramel malt presence and chewed, sweet, used rubber. Briefly interesting. And then I stop tasting anything because all the hops and alcohol kill my palate. Sitting for a bit and not drinking allows this lingering Pepto-Bismol, jelly-like texture and residual barleywine boozey sweetness to emerge, so I'm left wondering if there was something interesting I missed in the finish.		Because there is no finish to this beer.		The ""finish"" would be like equating global thermonuclear war to the end of a military skirmish. There's not really anything left to talk about, no victory to celebrate.		Consolation prize: It's got some body to it. And the hops really do beat the shit out of the 13% alcohol. Other than in the finish, it was barely there for what is now 50 straight minutes of consumption. But really, served even a little cold, the hops blow it away."
"Purchased in an organic shop in North London. Coming in a 330ml green bottle, BBE 22/10/06, it's served lightly-chilled in a slim goblet.		A: pours a light straw hue, the white beer head is loosely-formed, against a fiercely-carbonated body consisting of huge and microscopic bubbles...	S: a not very assertive note of doughy lager malts come with an equally mild floral scent of German noble hops (Hallertau in this case); more sweetish and slightly grainy hints from lager malts at the back. Pretty mild but not unpleasant at all.	T: semi-thick maltiness prevails upfront, fast giving way to a mixed flavour of honeyish note+sugar cane juice+cold boiled cabbages+toasty malts... the hop flavour is reduced to next to non-existence on the palate, if the residual, subdued dryish touch can't even remind one of hops... The finishing palate is not crisp nor clean, leaving a slightly sticky feel, like unfermented starch.	M&D: spritzy and semi-sharp on the mouthfeel, very thin-bodied, without any focus on the palate. I'm quite let down by this beer, esp. when the Bath Ales does so many good cask ales--perhaps that's where a line should be drawn in terms of brewing efforts? No comments."
"The beer is extremely light yellow, almost clear. Average macros have more color to them then this beer. There is a thin fizzy head that dies down to some lacing that stuck throughout the beer. The smell almost seemed skunked and is similar to another Dutch beer I can think of (Heineken).		Taste was lacking, seeming watered down and only a crisp aftertaste kept my taste score from being lower. This beer goes down like water, so I can't take a lot of palate points off.		Overall, it about average for a widely distributed macro but not worth the ""premium import"" title."
"Poured a dark copper colour with a very fluffy and over-carbonated head. The head though was of nice colouration: off-white towards the brown spectrum. All from a 341mL standard brown bottle.		The smell is off. Overly hopped and of burnt malt. Not the worst, but very dry and sweet at the same time.		Taste was overly sweet, with a bitter finish. Carbonation was achieved in bottle through secondary fermentation. Actually offsets all flavours.		Kind of gross after a couple of sips, nothing too surprising considering the sweetness and bitterness.		Could not muster to get through the first to be honest, let alone thinking of opening another."
"I hate to slam a beer, but this was amazingly bad. I've had a smoked porter before and didn't like that either, but this was far worse. My wife said it ""smells like Band-Aids"" and she has a point. This beer smells smoky (obviously) and at the same time medicinal. For me, it was like someone scooped up the coals of a burned down building and made a tea out of them by steeping them in beer. Truly awful."
"Look: Gold, slight haze	Smell: Low hop scent, some citrus	Taste: Slight wheat taste. Bad after taste but smooth drinking		I think this was an old bottle. I read they stopped brewing it in May. It was consumed late September. I was really hoping for more from this beer but it fell far short. I'll probably try it again but only if it's from a new batch.		On a side note, this is my first beer review."
"a: Poured with a decent creamy white head that disipated to a very thin coating. No real lacing.	s: malt sweetness. Not what I expected from an IPA	T: Malt sweetness dominates. Toffee, Caramel, etc. Ends with a strong Hop finish	Mouthfeel: Decent carbonation	Drinkability: Not bad, but I was expecting a stronger hop presence. 		Eh, will not be buying up the cases of this stuff. I have two more in the basement that might be there for a while."
"Beautiful amber-copper color, clean. No evident carbonation. One inch of a beautiful and compact beige head, sticky.	The smell is quite light. Light malt, and very light caramel, maybe sugar. English style.	The taste is light too, very drinkable, with a good bitterness, decent hop. Maybe even bitter orange."
"33cl bottle, best Sept 10, batch LA09. Poured into goblet.		Fizzy soda-like head is gone before I'm done pouring. Mahogany color.		Cola/spruce aroma, some woody characteristics and some herbal notes.		Very sweet, brown sugar like, with licorice and other herbal flavors strong in the finish. Some roasted malt character as well. Bitterness very low.		Mouthfeel is not so good, since the beer is basically flat. This makes it not so drinkable, either, although the alcohol is hidden."
"A- Pours a clear light gold with white head. Head is gone a in a flash and leaves pretty much no lacing. 		S- Grains, very light floral hops, and a bit of corn. 		T- This is pretty much water with a touch of corn, grains, and a hint of grassy hops. 		M- Very light in body and quite a bit of carbonation. 		O- No thanks on this one."
"Poured a medium straw hue with a one finger foamy white head. There was decent retention and lacing.		The smell was rather nondescript. Light grain, some adjuncts and a smattering of hop.		The taste was equally benign with a clean malt and light hop. Some apparent adjunct sweetness muddied the waters a bit.		The mouthfeel was thin and clean. No real body.		Overall a drinkable lager when served ice cold. Not something I would necessarily revisit."
From my notes 5/29/2007 pours a one-finger white head that fades slowly leaving an excellent lace. Crystal clear amber color. Slight hoppy nose. Good carbonation and light bodied. Flavor is like a typical euro lager, hoppy, uninspiring. Clean finish. 2.90 ($3.97) on-tap 250ml glass from Hilton Hotel Luxembourg, Luxembourg.
"330 ml into tulip. BBE 20.July 2011. The beer is advertised as doppelbock so lets see how it meets the requirements of the style.	Off white bubbly head overlays a coppery brown body with good clarity. The short lived head quickly fades to a sheet of loosely agglomerated bubbles that persists. 	The nose is strong maltiness, caramel with some melanoidin-toasty notes, hints of dark chocolate and evident hops. Likewise the aroma, the flavor is dominated by malts and caramel with melanoidin-toasty notest. Hops provide dry finish. A bit less than average carbonation with watery texture. Boring.		In short: sweetish, watery imitation of doppelbock."
"After a good review from a friend and seeing a story on the brewery on tv i was excited to try this beer. I could not have imagined that after 350 reviews that this would be my first drain pour. Maybe I have weird taste buts but this almost made me sick.		This poured a beautiful dark ruby with a thin white head. The smell was of super strong wood smoke. It smelled liek burning rubber and at times it smelled like burnt BBQ. THe flavor was of burnt BBQ ribs. While the taste was not quite as bad as the smell it was still nasty. Tasted like rubber that was burnt to shit.	Feel was thin and carbonated.		This isn't working for me.		Again, maybe my tastebuds were weird that night or maybe it was a bad bottle."
Very German indeed. This brew is a clear yellow color Very fresh looking and not overly hoppy in anyway. The brew has the aromas of a pilsner which bums me out. The flavors of a tradional German pilsner are in there too. It's not a bad beer for those who like this style,
"Finger plus of deep tan foam with an orange tint, pretty good density but has a lot of larger bubbles which hampers retention, slow and steady dissolve the lacing more thick streaks than ""lace"" per se. Burnt reddish orange color, close to brick-like, clear and close to full transparency, close to zero bubbles visible inside the glass (as opposed to outside the glass). Drives into your nose like a pick, even the ample honey, caramel and pine sap can't lessen the brunt of the highly herbaceous hoppiness and sour white to pink grapefruit, close to having a salty saline quality, the pineapple, nectarine, mango, papaya, kiwi fruit scents leaden and gluey, leaves you suspecting that there's more complexity under the massive density but you're not getting much of it. Full-bodied is putting it ""lightly,"" hard to imagine an IPA more densely packed, little sense of movement, impressive if tiring. Pink grapefruit, tangerine, mandarin orange all juicy if not quite vivid. The nectarine, guava, mango, pineapple, apricot fruit steamrolled by the bitterness of the hops, so hard to focus on anything but those hops. Still, there's some molasses and brown sugar as well as pine, can't say it's that floral, would require airiness for that. I respect pushing the envelope but this is too over the top and just very hard to enjoy in its immediacy in your mouth."
Color is a rather unattractive orange-brown, and the lack of any head or lacing doesn't help the appearance. Scents of dark fruits and molasses are nice if a bit weak, and there's a bit of a boozy smell too. Caramel and molasses are up front in the taste, with a punch of booziness in the finish that I don't find particularly pleasant. High pucker factor and plenty of burn going down the throat. This is not one of Founder's better offerings.
"Poured dark mahogany as expected. Carbonation was pop-like.		Smelled strongly of bourbon. A bit alcoholic, though, and overpowering.		Tasted strong of bourbon, which was kind of good. Next on the list is alcohol. Next was water. Yep, water. And finally, a small packet of hops.		Mouthfeel was that of a super-good pepsi. ...not good for this style. Watery and fizzy and that is about it.		Overall this did not impress me. I am glad I was able to find this in a single 12oz bottle, because four of these would be a big disappointment. One is worth just seeing what it is all about if you are in the mood for such an activity."
"I can't believe I actually bought a single at the grocery store. I also can't believe this used to be my favorite beer, I would buy this if I were treating myself. I also can't believe I poured this into a glass and am judging it's appearance. Well I did. 		Appearance-Pale light yellow with a white bubbly head that dissipates almost immediately. Little lacing.		Smell-Corn and Grain. 		Taste-Some earthy tones and grassy funk. Drinkable though, and I'm trying to judge according to style.		Mouthfeel-Worst part. Tons of prickly carbonation, no body at all, had to choke this down.		Overall-Only positive is it's under 100 calories, besides that don't drink this unless you like Light Beers."
"Okocim Mocne (""strong"") looks a shade stronger than most Euro pale lagers; its golden tone is refulgent and its complexion clear as a bright summer's day. The little bubbles that dot the landscape give it character and charm, the soapy pool of head they become part of lend assurance that this is well brewed. Looking at it, I trust this will be a good lager...		Smelling it, however, tells a different story. Warm and bready corn muffins await the nose, all too eager to showcase a big box-store worthy processed smell. This bouquet is stale smelling and predominantly unauthentic, lacking in both hops and barley, and tinged with a note of alcohol that, while not outright just yet, is suspiciously close to the surfacing. 		Okocim regular - like many bottled, mass-produced, exported Polish lagers - is reasonably unpalatable although in this case, it's made doubly so. The 'strong' in its name doesn't correspond so much to the alcohol as it does just the fact that its taste has been compounded twice over. The flavour of corn syrup and white bread is twice as strong.		To its credit, the alcohol itself is not made any more obvious; instead, what drinkers have to endure for the extra buzz is an extra-prevalent taste of chemical adjuncts and disagreeable, cheap malts. If you ask me it's not worth it - if you're drinking to get drunk try hard liquor, that's my advice. If you're looking to enjoy a satisfying beer look elsewhere. 		The beer was designed to be as tasteless as possible, a goal in which it relatively succeeds, and as drinkable as possible - a goal which it succeeds only with the assistance of a plugged nose and near freezing temperatures. This is negligibly different from the original, which is a good thing for alcoholics, but an unfortunate disappointment for everyone else. 		They can poke you with all different kinds of instruments but it's still pain. Okocim Mocne, living up to its name, roughs up the palate with more strength than lesser-alcohol lagers. The abuse suffered is nowhere worth the price paid for it, no matter the momentary jollies that 7.5% alcohol might bring. Stronger is definitely not better."
"This is a big beer. At over 10% ABV, it is not for the faint of heart. Combined with the significant barrel aged flavor, I would imagine a non-enthusiast would balk at this one. I was proved wrong, however, when my wife had a taste and gave it an enthusiastic review. I really like this beer, but cannot give it the best rating due to the heat of the alcohol. There are lots of great flavors, and I'd session it just to explore them all, as it would take some time to get past the bourbon barrel flavor. As a whiskey fan, this one has a lot to offer, but I would classify this as a specialty brew - I could almost taste a little funk that you might find in a brett. I qive this one a very qualified, but very enthusiastic recommendation.		Cheers."
"On tap at the brewpub back in March 2009.		A: Slightly reddish with a decent head and lacing that sticks fairly well. 		S: The aroma of all the types of pepper is quite appetizing.		T: While the pepper was good in the smell, there's just a little too much going on here--it's simply overpowering. Aside from the pepper, I can pick out some sweetness and a little bit of the Belgian yeast character.		M: Fairly light body, but again overtaken by the pepper. 		D: Okay. I really like this brew in theory, but the execution was just a little bit off."
Dark orange color with no lasting head or lacing. Big time citrus and pine aroma with a noticeable alcohol smell. Whoa, this thing is bitter! Toasty malts are barely noticeable behind the huge citrus rind, stingily bitter hops, mostly grapefruit, a little bit of pine, thick and oily on the tongue. It was almost like drinking PineSol and hairspray. This beer was a bit too much for me. I like big hop bombs, but it was hard to finish this one as the alcohol was a bit too noticeable and warming. Not the best I've had from Founders.
Well, what can I say. This is definantly the most unique beer I have ever tried. However in this case it is not a good thing. This beer would make a wonderful cooking beer but for drinking it is possibly one of the worst I have ever tasted. The smell and flavour are just not something I want to drink. Very hickory smoked ham. Used to flavour a chili it would be wonderful, but like I said, as a drink the nastiest thing in the world. Literally like drinking smoked ham.
"Appearence-A yellow color. Little head that does not last.		Smell-Not much and not certain that I can describe it.		Taste-A little watery and somewhat thin taste.Out of fairness to the beer, the taste does fit the style		Mouthfeel-Not much.		Drinkability-I am not a fan of light beers but I would take this over a Coors light. I had a half Amstel Light last night (poet?) from my wifes glass and did not hate it. Its just not for me."
"Appearance - some slight haze to the orange/amber brew. This bottle uncapped and foam started kicking up and over the neck of the bottle, so I didn't go too nuts on the pour. Ended up with a fairly small head, holding steady at a thin but complete cover. A solid layer of lace all around the glass.		Aroma - sweet, almost syrupy grain whiff, followed by citrusy, orangy hoppiness. A little sugary for an IPA but it's okay.		Taste - hmm, interesting. The grain has a sweet, but not sugary bend to it. It has a brown sugar edge, very much like the Cucapa brown ale, but some of that buttery English aspect, too. The brown sugar taste gives the beer a slightly sweet yet sour off taste. The hops come in dry, bitter, not much flavor but not overbearing either. A bit of a funkfied IPA, whether by intent or not I've no idea. Not a total miss, not a total hit either.		Mouthfeel - good smoothness and accompanying crispness. The body is nice and weighty, giving the beer some notable heft.		Drinkability - I could potentially learn to like this, but I don't. Seems too likely a candidate for infection with that weird sugar, brown ale bit."
"served into a nonic glass from a 12oz brown long neck bottle with a crimped cap.		Clear,vibrant red color,2"" thick slightly off-white head.some wisps of tiny bubbles stringing together tightly knited.Good retention with a fair amount of laced curtians down the glass.		A good malty aroma with sweet carmell,toasty and nutty.A pleasing fruityness,a nice and complex aroma.		A light carmell taste,astringent,grassy,candied tastes,friuty,slighty sour finishes tart with some citrus rind. The taste was a bit of a let down after the nice aromas. 		Medium body,grainy,some sourness. Goes down fairly easy, just nothing to really make me want to drink more"
"Pours a golden orange, almost amber color, opaque with nearly no head retention. Then again, my fridge stays a bit colder than I'd like it to for the beer's sake due to the missus. The first thing I got in the nose was paste. Reminded me of kindergarten. Then I started thinking in terms of smoke and I realized it was just smokiness, like from a campfire. Some alcohol sting, and sweet, tart malt are in there too. No yeast or hops to speak of in the nose (or taste, for that matter). Sweet amber malt hits the tongue first, then super smoky flavors take over. I get some sweet nutiness in the finish but bitter smoke remains on the palate. A bit thick mouthfeel. Smooth, wet finish.		Sorry, but I just couldn't get paste out of my mind and that definitely affected my feelings of this beer. Although I had a bad reaction to the smell, the taste wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but it was interesting to say the least. I'm surprised this came from Germany. If I had to guess without knowing who made it, I'd have said Rogue because of the super strong smokiness. I appreciate what they are trying to do. I just wish I had it with some barbeque, as I think it would make a great pairing. Gotta give it to them for hiding the 8% so well, too. I wouldn't necessarily buy it again, but it was an interesting experience."
"Appearance: Pours a deep honey yellow with visible carbonation throughout the body. A billowy tight white cap forms. I see bits of what I can only assume are hop floaties. Pretty good looking in my nonic tumbler.		Smell: A mix of citrusy hops, some floral hop notes, with a wheaty base to it. I'm picking up some yeast notes as well. A little light in this department but certainly forgiveable for the style. 		Taste: A belgian yeasty funk dominates this brew. Not good in my book. Mostly floral hop notes noted. A wheat bread base to this is the most dominate flavor noted on the palate. A very yeasty and bready finish. I feel deceived as the aroma did not match the taste. 		Mouthfeel: Medium to light bodied and prickly.		Drinkability: I'm sure had I expected this, it may be a nice summer session beer. It tasted too much like a bad belgian beer to me. I'm not sure if the batch was off or the yeast just went wild but this beer is WAY too funky for me. I won't be going back to this one for sure. Likeable enough I suppose but certainly not to style. Avoid.		Notes: I couldn't handle this beer. This was only the second beer I've ever had that ended up in a drain pour. Most definitely AVOID."
"Chilled bomber into a glass. 		No bottle date. I'm assuming it's fresh. 		A: Pours a clear straw/gold body with substantial off-white head. Retention isn't great, and neither is the lacing. 		S: Solventy! Leafy, tea-like hops with pine and some citrus. 		T: Not as solventy as the nose. Actually not a bad flavor. Dominated by leafy, tea-like hops with pine needles and a touch of grapefruit rind. My issue is that it's really harsh, astringent, and bitter. Not a lot of hop flavor but there is a lot of hop bitterness. 		M: Full-bodied, heavy, with low carb. 		D: It's not awful... But again, it's harsh, astringent, and very bitter. Not particularly enjoyable, and it's not something I would recommend as anything more than a middling benchmark of the style."
"So in my review of Trafalgar's smoked stout I said I wouldn't buy any more beer from the brewery. The OCB summer sampler just went on sale so I bought it for the other beers and I'm pretending this one was free. So my expectations are low going in. 		Pours a bright yellow colour with thick head. Lots of lacing. I'm feeling hopeful about this. Not much for smell or taste though. A hint if grassy hops, with a mild off flavour. Pretty bland. Carbonation is good at least."
"Pale clear yellow straw color with thin white head, little retention, and no lacing.		S- Faint and weak grains and hops. Skunky and musty.		T- Musty water with a bitter skunk finish. Boring.		M- Light, watery and thin.		D- Easy as water until you get the terrible bitter skunk aftertaste."
"500ml kick ass looking can. 4.1%abv. best before 06/07		outside of the standard looking fizzy yellow beer, its got great head retention. nice even white frothy, 1/2cm thick. even a bit of lacing. she's a looker.		a bit bland on the nose, no hops, little malt, and a little cardboard staleness which eases gently into the taste as well. 		along with the cardboard, its got a light malty sweetness in its favor. pretty blunt finish. 		eh, nice looking can with its sharp and aggressive styling. too bad they dont take the same approach to whats inside."
"The 2010 version was hop strong, but 2011 was wrong from the outset.		This beer was a lovely golden/orange with off white head in a glass.		The nose was hop dominated...go figure. Copper notes and bitter hops were all of the nose.		The taste was similar to a yard full of wild onion cut on a 94 degree and blown into your face. This was gross and drain poured.		The mouthfeel was average for the style, if you can get past the onion.		Overall, I love Founders. Period. However, this year's batch of Devil Dancer is not what it should have been. I think that it is a mistake (maybe?). I read other reviews of an A+ beer, but I am shocked. However, I suggest that you drink everything else they make!"
The pour was amber as promised, and the nose was very interesting. The floral notes were immense, and very pleasing. I could also smell a mixture of cedar and perfume. Bleh! Tastes just like it smells. It tastes like I'm a kid and drinking my sister's perfume. Mouthfeel is good, but who cares when it tastes this bad! La Binchoise, meet my drain!
"A- Pours a red color with a pinkish colored head. Right then I knew I was in trouble.		S- A touch of malts and quite a bit of tart cherries.		T- Wow this is a beer. My first thought is that this is some sort of wine cooler. Taste like it smells tart cherries dominant.		M- Light to medium in body and ok carbonation.		D- No thanks I'll pass only the second Founders I didn't like and yes, they were both fruit beers."
"Appears pretty good, nice orange glow, not much head to speak of though.		Ugh. This might just be old, the oxidation is now the only real aroma component. Hints of caramel or toffee and unfermented wort.		Tastes pretty much as the nose led me to believe. Caramel dipped cardboard... and some stale booziness.		Mouthfeel is actually great. Feels soft and smooth, then carbonation builds on the palate to a nice creaminess without feeling too dry or foamy.		Overall, I would never pay the price again ($5 for a little bottle of lager) for this beer- Unless I absolutely knew it was fresh."
"well, I had to try this beer as it is a staple of the pilsner class.		The beer poured into my trusty sam adams beer glass with just a little bit of head.		the hue is a light golden, and quite see through		the smell is not pleasant, there is no smell of hops		I forced it down as it was not a cheap beer, though it tastes like one. The sides of my tounge are mad at me, and ready for a pale ale or something with more body and taste.		the mouthfeel is light and almost crisp		it is somewhat drinkable, but not a great beer by any means"
"Well...a hair better then the other light's; Coor's and Bud.	the only reason I bought this was becuase I didn't have the bottle yet. 	Golden in color, very light taste, not as watered down as Coor's for sure! If I was weighing close to 300lbs, I would choose this over the other light's that I have tried."
I don't know what the big deal about this beer is. Its slightly above Miller Light, but why bother? Pours a fizzy yellow with a wet hay/corn smell to it. Not much to the taste... fizzy tasteless pilsner. Zero character. Why pay $5 for this at the bar?
"Never had a smoked beer before, so thought I'd indulge. It didn't take me long to realise this wasn't my style of beer. I don't even really like smoked cheese, so maybe this one wasn't for me. Still, it smelled inviting, and got my appetite going. I just had a hard time getting over the taste. Nothing but smoke, smoke from a smoked salmon, not my type of drink. To look over most of my other reviews, I like beers that are ""crisp"" and ""refreshing"" so this one wasn't for me. Still, made well with quality ingredients, so wont rate too low the taste was just a personal preferance thing. Couldn't finish more than a few sips."
"Note: I had to add the (Green Label) to the name because my review wouldn't go through otherwise. Probably because the site wouldn't accept two identically named beers from the same brewery.		Simple amber that is clear and bright. What? No fine (or not so fine) floaters? Maybe I actually got a relatively fresh Euro pale lager for once. The eggshell colored cap looks pretty decent too. Texture is fine, as is persistence and lace. Not bad at all.		Considering the style and the country of origin, the aroma is surprisingly... uh... okay. The beer smells of untoasted grain and a modest amount of hops that don't smell grassy enough to be Saaz (but probably are). No nastiness and no alcohol.		The slow slide in scores continues. Werewolf tastes more bland than it smells. Part of it is the mouthfeel, but the quality of the ingredients appears to be lacking; unless advanced age is playing a role. Again, though, it doesn't look, smell or taste past its prime. It tastes like it never had a prime.		The flavor profile is reminiscent of the water used to soak grain, with an understated hop bitterness and a faint hint of alcohol. I'm finding less and less to like as the ounces pass, and have no choice but to drop the taste score one more slot. Since I usually reserve 2.0s for beer that is borderline nasty, that seems fair in this case.		The mouthfeel is both watery and slightly oily, an off-putting combination if there ever was one. A serious shortage of bubbles doesn't help. A decent mouthfeel might have dragged the drinkability score up with it. 		R.A.D. must have liked the name and the label (they are pretty cool) because they used them on two of their offerings. The only difference is that red is used for the higher-ABV dark lager and green is used for this pale lager. Bottom line: you shouldn't judge a book by its cover and you shouldn't judge a beer by its label. Below the bottom line: avoid the Werewolf."
"This one is a clear yellow-gold color with very little carbonation and very lathargic bubbles. The thin, lacy crown is totally gone within minutes. 		 The nose has metallic corn on the cobb, musty wheat and sour dough bread. not much else.		 This is a light, crispy feeling lager with a very thin malt flavor, mostly dried wheat and corn flavor's. There are no horrible ""off"" flavor's like metal or skunks. The hops are very light and subtle, herbal and green. Not much happening here, but it's not a total loss.		 not exactly recommended."
"12 oz bottle into Pint glass.		Very dark like West Virginia coal. Tiny bubbly head dissapates almost instantly to no trace of lacing or cap. Smells a little of oatmeal and caramel. Mostly a dark coffee aroma. Not a trace of any internal effervescence. Whoa, this tastes a lot like coffee too. With as little carbonation as is present, I could easily mistake this for a left-out cup of coffee. Okay, after warming there is a little more oatmeal taste in the middle, but the mouthfeel suffers from the lack of carbonation. This is one I did not care to finish."
"Presented with a delightfully hokey/cheesy label of a half woman/half wolf label (SCARY!). The born on date or freshness date or batch number (I'm really not sure which it is), says ""L.69116"". I seriously doubt I even had a Lithuanian beer before now. This wolf is presented in a 16.09 ounce formatted bottle.		According to the label, this is based on the old recipe of one of the best Birai beers... Great!!! This will taste like one of the best Birai beers! I can't wait! Oh - but wait - what the hell is a Birai beer? Oh, thanks google - you saved the day again, Birai is a small town in Lithuania. Anyway, moving along...		Tis the season of frights, so let's crack this mystifying beer... 		A: Pours like your typical English pub ale. Medium brown and murky with some golden highlights. An aggressive pour produces a  tan, creamy head that disappears quickly.		S: Ok, the smell is better than the cheesy label would suggest. Rich, bountiful whiffs of caramelized malts all over the place with a trailing floral finish. Butter, brown sugar and unidentifiable traces of spice can also be picked up. But is this a Belgian Dark Ale or an American barleywine?		T/M: All I get on the taste is a wave of caramelized malts with the smallest dash of earthy hops. This is a medium to full bodied beer with a heavy dosing of malts as the nose suggests. As the beer warms, I taste some apple cider, Belgian candied sugars and small qualities of tea. Light carbonation and almost watery in spots, yet syrupy in the middle (odd, I know). Overall, not a very common feeling mouthfeel - rather strange to my 'foreign' tongue. Not refreshing with the long wet finish pronounced by the lack of bitterness and dryness. Drinkable, yes - but not my cup of tea. The C+ rating given was a bit of a gift, because I've never had a beer from this country."
"Originally sampled on 12 January 2003. I am writing this review from my notes.	Oh-oh, screw top, bad omen! This pours opaque burnt amber with a thin white head. It has a slight hoppy aroma. The taste is more grapefruit than hops. This was a disappointing beer."
"12 oz		A: A deep golden color. Nice head that dissapates quickly and leaves very little lace. Lots of bubbles streaming upwards.		S: Meh smells spicy and kinda watery. Not much malt nose, but it is there. Not bad but nothing spectacular.		T: Spicy notes of what used to be saaz hops are still there, but the 75% hop extract rule keeps running through my mind. Either way a good spicy taste. This beer is not as fresh as I have had before, but the best Urquells that I have had were good. Their tradition of keeping it in green bottles is killing me, as some will be a superbly bitter beer that would be a 4.0 while others are much blander and some just plain not good at around the 2.0 range. Taste is spicy hops with a little sweet malt that is present on the palate. Going back and editing this I dropped it to a 2.5 as the newer tradition of using hop extract for the beer is deeply disappointing in the taste.		M: Light bodied and kinda dry, very carbonated, but pleasant for this style. I do find the mouthfeel pleasing.		D: You can drink these beers all day. But since there is very little consistancy between packs, I take off points."
A very decent light beer. Their amber beer somewhat reformulated. Floral grapefruit hops, and moderate use of hops carries the day. Though a bit too carbonated on-tap, perhaps this one is for the ladies. Could be a tad of chocalate malt and a mid-sip datesfigs.
"330 ML poured into a Sam Adams Perfect pint		A-- Poured a very light orange brown color, or a dark straw yellow. Half a finger of off white head. Shows medium to high carbonation. A lot of sediment in the bottle.		S-- Smell reminds me more of a adjunct more than anything else. Pretty metallic smell. Lots of ringwood in this. Very faint floral smell but hidden by the ringwood. Smells almost like VB in a lot of ways.		T-- Hops taste more like pine. Tastes a lot like a typical Australian Lager. Lots of ringwood and metallic. Just throw in some pine for effect. Also a bit of a soapy quality to this.		M-- Fairly sour aftertaste. Not a great tasting beer. Has a little bit of a sweet kick to it but it turns to sour. No hop flavor to it and very unbalanced. Keep thinking this is infected with bad hops as it tastes more like bad homebrew.		D-- Unimpressed to say the least. Gets more sour the more it warms and hard to drink and finish. Not workable as an adjunct , as it tastes more like VB, Crown, Tooheys and pretty awful as an English Pale Ale as it is too sour."
There was an overpowering fishy taste to the beer. I lost the Belgian-y esters and the malty notes I was hoping for. I remember catching the off-flavors on an earlier bottle I'd picked up, but nothing as strong as this. After three sips, it was a bottle dump. And that's rare for me.
"Comes out of the bottle just fine ... CO2 gives a soft, medium head.	Oddly, the head condenses to 3-4 little foam islands.		A slightly skunky euro pils aroma I did not expect from a brown bottle.	(This might be a plus 'cuz there is no other smell).		Initially, like the aroma, there is some character- then, alas, watery thinness.		The finish is soo vacuous you can hear it sucking!		If you don't mind the negatives I've mentioned, you could drink a dozen of these- but why?		They also get my dubious award for the most illiegible production code- some raised white dots on a red background that appear to make no consumer sense whatsoever."
"Received in trade from phisigben, thanks for the opportunity!	Pours a crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a huge fluffy tan head that slowly recedes. Smells of cinnamon and nutmeg mostly. Quite heavy spicy aroma obliterates any beer smells from my perception. Taste has a bit of a caramel sweet malt flavor upfront before the gingerbread house flavor takes over and ruins this beer. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet spice laden mouthfeel. I won't mince words here, this beer is horrible. Its over spiced and I couldn't finish my glass."
"Poured into a stemmed tulip: Two fingers of tan head, loose & sudsy, that drops to a finger. Burnt orange body with bright, golden-orange highlights. 		Smell changes a little quickly: started off like apples & nuts, soon turns to a kind of grape-flavoring, like cough syrup but not so medicinal. Or grape lollipop, just this sort of synthetic grape smell. Further whiffs reveal mild nutmeg, maybe some licorice, & diapers(!) -- not DIRTY diapers, mind you, but the kind of weird smell from the plastic you get from diapers. Hmmm.		And the taste follows suit: grape ""drink,"" with some apple sauce & a hovering nuttiness in the background. In almost exact reverse order: grape, apple, nuts. Luckily no diaper taste. There's that kind of muddling with alcohol heat that I get from a lot of Belgian strong darks (which is really what this should be classified as, at 8.2%, don't you think?) -- a bunch of interweaving flavors that add up to kind of a mess.		On the full side with the mouthfeel, but with a kind of metallic deadening, like zinc. Double hmmm. Also, the booze is little too sharp & hot for my liking, given that the flavors don't measure up, IMO.		My expectations weren't high, but this limboed right under them nonetheless. Not great, for sure -- any time the words ""synthetic"" and ""mess"" appear in a review, you know it's not good."
"Beer reviewed from detailed notes taken last night. It was the fourth and final beer of my evening and it really kicked my ass. I don't remember getting from the kitchen to the upstairs and woke up in the guest bedroom this morning.		Pours a sticky off-white (orangish) head over a mildly cloudy light yellow-amber liquid. Smells of corn alcohol and cardboard. Uh-oh, I'm gonna regret this one. The head has settled to a sticky thin layer and it's left decent lacing on the inside of the glass. A second smell is like stale bubble-gum. As if you chewed a piece all day, set it on the dresser when you went to bed, and stuck it back in your mouth the next morning. Sawdust dry.		Tastes sweet malty to start, then funky (funk gives me the willies). It's not a phenoilic belgian funk, it's more like a strong version of the hint of funk I find in Oktoberfests. The beer is dry and there is a bit of sweet fruity ester in there. Canned pear syrup, I guess. Md light body and highly carbonated. No thanks."
"This beer surprised me! Had it at a party at work--bottle on ice, poured into a plastic cup. Yeah, I know.		Golden colored--slightly darker than most similar mass-produced lagers. No head to speak of. Meh.		Smelled just a hint of skunk, not much else.		Tasted better than I'd imagined. It wasn't skunky at all (which is what I expected). It wasn't great, but hey, who's counting? (Oh, we are. Oh well.)		Mouthfeel was a step above water, and not a big one. It was a little too carbonated too.		Drinkability? I'd have it again, but I'd never buy it. Don't think it would pair well with anything..."
"I was just really let down by my last review...I'm hoping this makes up for it...		Nice enough looking beer. Not quite brown, more of a brown-red. Pours a decent off-white head. Cloudy but not opaque. 		Uh-oh. I don't know that corn-on-the-cob is a good smell for a beer to have, but this one is loaded with it. Some sweet roasted corn and a bit of yeast. Mostly corn. 		Damn. This could be my first drain pour. Tastes like rotten corn-on-the-cob. Actually, it tastes exactly like a scratch-and-sniff corn-on-the-cob sticker I remember from when I was five or six years old. Yuck. I can't taste anything else under the corn nastiness. 		Medium bodied with medium carbonation. I only wish this average mouthfeel was supporting an average taste. 		Doesn't look that bad or feel too bad but the taste is just horrible. I've tried this brewery's Recompense on the advise of a friend and was also very disappointed. Mort De Rire means ""dying of laughter."" Maybe that's what Brasseurs Et Freres are doing knowing that people are actually buying this stuff. 		(My girlfriend thinks all beer tastes the same so I've passed it over to her. Otherwise this would have litterally been poured down the drain. I can't believe she doesn't know the difference between this and Peche Mortel...that doesn't make sense.)"
"Poured from a ""bomber"" bottle into a standard pint glass. Almost flourescent yellow in color, with a very thin ""now you see it, now you don't"" head of foam.	Aroma-Sunkist orange soft drink	Taste-Sunkist with some malt thrown in. Cloyingly sweet and just about undrinkable to my hop-head tastes, even on a 90 degree day. Maybe over ice or with a shot of rum. Not for everyone.	Especially me. I do enjoy other Hoppin' Frog brews however, just not this one."
Pours a clean deep yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, big alcohol, with small fruitiness mixed in there. In the taste, a small sweetness of fruit and a dry alcohol presence all the way through. An alcohol bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry alcohol aftertaste. It took me a minute, but this would compliment lobster and butter really well, but as a beer on it's own, it is struggling.
"A- Pours a slightly hazy, light golden amber color with pretty much no head. A handful of bubbles pop up and no lacing.		S- Quite a bit of sweet malts, maybe clove and a ton of alcohol.		T- Not digging this at all. Pretty sweet, a ton of bready malts, and alcohol.		M- Pretty thin in body and carbonation was above average.		O- Drain pour on this one. Not at all what I expected and those expectation were pretty low."
Yuck. Of the European Green Bottle imports (Heine, Grolsch, St. Pauli, Beck's, etc.) this is my least favorite. Extremely bitter, tasted like a super Grolsch. The flavor and smell is so sharp that its almost overwhelming. This beer isn't all that common, and certainly not worth the effort. If you are a big fan of the Euro Green Bottles, then you might as well try it. If not, then stay away. Its not worth the fairly expensive price.
"12 oz. bottle sampled in wheat glass		The color is a cloudy yellow, like the flesh of a peach. The head is minimal, but pure white. The big aromas are extremely spicy and smokey-- lots of clove here and some wet cardboard. The mouth is smooth with pangs of spice, tingling my tongue. The spice is the star in the taste, easlity overshadowing any of the fruits that try to say ""hellllooo."" The fruits are lime, pear, grapefruit--- what is this, an IPA with no hops? The finish doesn't do too much.		I am kind of disappointed with this hefe. The clove and smoke is too much and doesn't let the fruits balance at all."
"A - Pours a dark brown almost black color with a HUGE rocky foam head that is not settling down very quickly...		S- With this being an 8.6% Bourbon Barrel Stout I would have expected alot more from the nose. Some faint roasted malt aromas but I'm not getting much bourbon or anything else for that matter.		T- The flavor underneath all of these bubbles helps me to breath a sigh of relief because I really thought that this might be infected (20 mins and the 4 inch head hasn't settled a bit). Thankfully there is a decent stout flavor here with some chocolate and roasted flavors. Still not much bourbon though.		M- Medium bodied and wildly over carbonated. As I popped the top the cap almost launched across the room. Even with a delicate pour I struggled to keep the foam from taking up most of the room in my glass. Very sudsy mouthfeel and certainly not typical for a stout.		D- The flavor was decent but the nose was lacking and I didn't get any bourbon. Way too carbonated."
