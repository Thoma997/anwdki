"Too imaptient- poured straight from fridge into a snifter. Trying to slowly sip this...	 	A- black cherry color, clear/no haze. Mocha colored head. Head didn't last long, but the lacing on edge persists.		S- dark and roasted malts, mild hop notes and dark fruits...fig?		T- roasted malts, burnt caramel/ molases. Just at the brink of being too cloying but the presence of hops balances it out. Not too boozy but it's still detectable in the back. The more I drink this the more I want brie cheese...		M- slick and viscous. full bodied low carbonation with tighter bubbles.		Overall a pretty good beer. Not much else in the market for black barleywines but this one is right at that fine line of almost being too much between the roasts/ hops/and sweetness. Good perhaps in smaller doeses. Otherwise, perfect for cold autumn nights!		Two Nemesis's brewed in 2010. This is the latter.";;;;;;;;;;
"Kinda surprised I haven't reviewed this long ago. 	Not my favorite style of beer but this is a good rendition.	Big, sugary malts dominate the experience with a rich hops bitterness to underline the molasses type sweetness. Caramel and toffee notes mixed with coffee; the hops bitterness makes one think of coffee. 	Hints of dark, fermented fruit have this teeter slightly in the Belgian style direction but this is clearly a Scotch ale. Flashes of single malt whiskey can be detected at the edges of the tongue. 	Definitely worth a visit if one wants a malt bomb with some bitter edges.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks goes out to goryshkewych and roopy40 for each sending me extra's of this. You guys are awesome!		Pours a deep black, with light visible only at the extreme edges. Doesn't pour any head, but a good swirl coaxes some bubbles out. No lacig either.		The nose is strong up front with bourbon and woody characters. I also get burnt malts, chocolate and oatmeal, a light coffee bean bitterness as well as toffee and caramel. Sweeter than I expected.		The taste takes a step back from the bourbon, although it's still there. Oaky, with chocolate and vanilla, roasted malts and tofffe, a light coffee note in the finish. Bourbon softer and in the background.		Mouthfeel is not as thick as I thought it would be, probably about medium. Not very viscous, and has a low carbonatoin. Drinkability is good, a sipper for sure.		Overall, I enjoyed this much more than the regular BORIS, as it just takes it up a notch. Good stuff, I'd be interested to find out how the DORIS turns out.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Pours a ruby red with two fingers of head. The beer is clear enough to see through, which if you do then you will get a rose colored view of the world.		S - Strong fruity/berry smell, with hints of malt and caramel.		T - Strong fruit taste that is really all there is to this beer, but it is a complex and rich fruit flavor. This is what almost every fruit berry wants to be.		M/D - The mouthfeel is light and refreshing, but the only thing keeping both of these categories is that the sweetness will get to you quickly.";;;;;;;;;;
from the bottle, poured crimson red with a nice fluffy light tan head aroma a nose full of hops, malts, grapefruits, hints of caramel, molasses. the hops were not as strong as the aroma which was good, nice mouth feel has a pleasant bitterness to it, grapefruit. do not know what malted rye taste like but there is a flavor in here that I like so maybe that is it. good beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"A- Dark with not much head that went away rather fast for my liking		S- Chocolate and high abv is what I am getting here, nice.		T- Chocolate and sweet toffee for me 		M- Nice sweet action on mouth 		D- This does not go down like the 9% abv . Smooth but after 3 you know that it does have that 9 abv !!";;;;;;;;;;
"(Bottle into Room-Temp Mug)		Appearance: Deep Golden (Honey-Colored) with Initial Off-White Head that Steadily Disappeared. Some Lace.		Aroma: Sweet and not Nearly as Hoppy as One Might Expect (Desire). Notes of Grapefruit and Grass		Taste: Rating from an IPA Perspective, Back Yard was Uncharacteristically Malty and Not Nearly Hoppy Enough. While the Bitterness Came Through, No Overwheling Hop Flavor was Found. Mainly Consists of a Carmel/Butterscotch taste with a Grassy Kick and a Vague Grapefruit/Citrisy Aftertaste. Smooth Finish Usually Atypical of most IPAs... 		Mouthfeel: Slight Build-Up on Sides of Tongue. Light-Medium Bodied with Very Little Carbonation.		Drinkability: Could be Enjoyed Consecutively, But More of an IPA with Trainingwheels for Those Beginning to Broaden their Appeal of Hoppy Beers.		Other: While I did Enjoy this Brew, it Simply did not Live Up to the Usual Expectations that most IPAs Generate. Would Recommend More Hops or Hopping at a Different Point of the Boil.";;;;;;;;;;
I had this beer on tap @ Sunset Grill & Tap. It pours a dark amber with a 2 fingered white head with very nice lacing. The smeel was very nice and hoppy, with a very nice malt base to it. The flavor followed suit, a very nice balance between the two and its alwasy nice what flavors the rye adds to beeds. This beer was nicelt carbonated and the mouthfeel was good and a drinkable brew, but not an all nighter.;;;;;;;;;;
"Picked this up at the Giant Eagle in the waterfront for 4.99		A - Very dark in color with slight ruby hues and a nice slight tinted head.		S - Smells of ashy charcoals and smoked meats, mostly pork in smell. A nice bit of hops and sweet malts to boot.		T - Wowed me at first but then turned kind of cloying after half the bottle. First sip's were pretty smoky with harsh ashy flavors but as I kept drinking it rounded with the sweet malt to bring an almost pork loin or ashy chop kind of taste. Bacon like in nature. As I got halfway the hops became more evident. 		M - Medium bodied this one is a good sipper though		Overall it's good in small doses as I said halfway through was great so thats 8-10 oz. A pint on tap would rock my world.		Overall a very nice Rauchbier with solid smoke taste, and pretty affordable to boot.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours near black in color with a dark brown head. The head remained throughout most of consumption. The aroma consists of dark chocolate, coffee and hints of alcohol. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and pretty smooth. This is a rich robust porter. Drinking this makes it hard to distinguish between what's a stout and what classifies as a porter sometimes these days. The flavor is loaded with ample amounts of dark roasted malt. At times an espresso-like quality emerges in the taste also. Goes down amazingly well for a 6.5% ale. Perfect for the dark winter nights that are coming.;;;;;;;;;;
Poured a golden yellow colour with a very small head that disappeared pretty quickly with minimal lacing. Smells clean and fresh. It has quite a sweet malty flavour with a little hop. Goes down very easily. Very refreshing crisp beer that would be a great summertime beer.;;;;;;;;;;
This beer pours opaque with a substantial caramel colored head that has good lacing characteristics. True to the description on the bottle (double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout), the coffee and chocolate notes come through strong on the nose. The taste isn't much different than would be expected from the smell... though the 60 IBU's are right there mid-palate with some alcohol present as well. This stuff feels like whole milk in your mouth... very heavy, but in a delicious way!;;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle 6 months to a year old. 		Thick, viscous black pour with a 1/2 finger tan head that recedes to a light covering.		Coffee, smooth chocolate and dark fruits make for a very pleasant nose. 		Excellent taste. Dark fruits against a backdrop of rich, smooth espresso and dark chocolate. Extremely well integrated, with a great smoothness from the oatmeal. Very light hopping at the end. I've had this before, but do not remember it being nearly this good. The age seems to have treated it extremely well - 6 months to a year seems perfect as the none of the flavors drop out but all the flavors just mesh better.		Mouthfeel is decadent and smooth, with a drinkability that is too good for such a beer.		Highly recommended. One of the better imperial stouts I've had in recent memory.";;;;;;;;;;
"Sent to me from Sudsdog,split a 12 oz bottle with WVbeergeek poured into a Mad Elf tulip glass out on the deck.		Hazy,orangy/reddish color. Light tan head with good retention and suspended yeast particles.		Clean,grassy,very citrusy with some grapefruit notes. Nice,pleasing aroma.		Citrusy,some grapefruit,hops dominate the palate, just enough carmelly maltlyness to nicely balance the taste with some burnt notes in there. A nice clean,sharp,snappy hop bite leaves a citrus rind aftertaste.		Medium body,smooth,creamy slightly cloying with a mouthwatering juicyness.	Very easy drinking,feels nice on the palate. Above average IPA not the best, but very memorable. Would like to drink this one again a lot more than a half bottle next time. An IPA worth a try!";;;;;;;;;;
Poured a rich reddish-copper (almost like crystal cola) in the glass. A 2 finger tan fine pored head sprang up but reduced quickly to only a ring on the glass. Not overly carbonated. overriding aroma is of smoke...good food processing smoke like birch or hardwood...reminiscent of westphalia ham. The first gulp the smoke overpowers your senses..all go blotto on the smoke signals...but after you have a sip or two or you finish a couple of pieces of cheese or oysters, the smoke power wanes and you get the mellow character of this delicate marzen lager...and it is delicate... with lots of subtle complexity (well made) you just dont get there on the first couple of gulps because it's cloaked by the smoke. All in all this is a toughie of a beer to slot...great german beer but perhaps too damn strong on smoke for some to be useful for anything else than a drink with similar strong tasting foods to off set them....like Jalapeno-infused anything or a strong tasting fish meal....I really like this beer and I drink it on its own in a session with out food but then I'm a marzen junke and Bamburg smoked marzen is a real treat for me....I had smoke taste up my nostrils and on the palate the next day...and loved it!;;;;;;;;;;
"Standard dark copper appearance of a dipa, average head to it. For being triple dry hopped, the aroma was good, yet underwhelming. I'd guess some breweries that only have one dry hop addition have more cumulative weight in terms of dry hopping. 3 small additions I'd guess. Grapefruit is the predominant hop aroma.		Grapefruit is the predominant hop flavor as well, massively bitter beer, impressively hides the almost 10% alcohol though. Chalky mouthfeel at times. Not enough malt bill for this one, could have been smoothed out a little. Amazingly sweet at times despite it seemingly lacking enough caramel/malt subsistence to balance out the hops and bitterness. 		Bottle purchased at 99 bottles. Was at a decent enough price I think that I'd recommend it to a hophead. Nothing complex or must have about it though.";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at GI Clybourn during Rare Stout Night, 25 May 2011. Four ounces in a taster.		This pours deep, viscous black with a small tan head rising up and falling away into just a bit of film with some slight lace sticking around. On the nose, there are mostly equal proportions of bourbon, toasted oats, dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and oak, with the maple syrup riding underneath it all. I was surprised that the maple was so subdued and the bourbon so prominent, as I would have expected it to be the opposite. It's a phenomenal nose. In the mouth the base beer comes out a bit more, the dark cocoa, fresh roasted coffee beans, and toasted oats providing the backbone for vanilla, oak, bourbon, and maple to play with. They've taken a great base beer, whatever it is, and aged it in barrels such that the barrel flavors mix and compliment rather than overpower. Again, I was surprised at the maple being more subtle that super sweet. The body is big but not humongous, though the finish is super long with the alcoholic heat dying away last.		Overall, this is a nice counterpart to KBS. To me, they're pretty close in flavor, with one notable addition here. Both of these beers are perfect examples of how barrel aging can take a great beer and make it better, rather than take a great beer and tack flavors on. Everything here is very well integrated. Can't wait for this to hit bottles, and glad I had the opportunity to try it.";;;;;;;;;;
This is my favorite beer. It pours a transparent golden amber color with head that sits just over the top of the beer. The nose is full of sweet caramel. The flavor on this lager is simply amazing. There is a lot of sweet caramel. The feel was moderately thick with not a whole lot of carbonation. Overall, perfect thickness and feel.;;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Light light straw colour. Laces the glass nicely but head retention is not so good.		Smell: Hint of floral hops and some metallic notes.		Taste: Not overly bitter, floral and grassy.		Mouthfeel: Light body. Perfect carbonation.		Drinkability: Easy to drink for sure.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to forgetfu for this bonus! 12oz pry-top brown glass bottle. Neck stamped **/05/09 (can't read the first numbers).		Pours a deadly silent thick, oily black with hardly any bubbles at all.		Nose is chock full o nuts with roasted coffee grounds, bittersweet baker's chocolate, dusty cocoa powder, black-strap molasses, and charred wood.		Palate is full-bodied and bitter. There's some residual sugar in there, but it's hidden very well by the roasted/burnt malts and aggressive bittering hops. Flavors are of black coffee, bitter dark chocolate, toasted oak chips, chocolate sauce, burnt malt, and cocoa nibs. Very little carbonation. Finish is long and drying.		Notes: A lot more bitter than I remembered this being. A damn fine beer. I personally like a little more sweetness to sneak through, but this is really well made. Still very bitter at over a year old.";;;;;;;;;;
This beer is one of my favs.  It has a nice look to it and goes down very well.  The hops are there for us hopheads but not overbearing for those people that do not care for the bitterness. I would highly recommend this beer.........CHEERS;;;;;;;;;;
"a - pours pitch black and fresh motor oil thick, half-inch deep tan head with retention mostly around the edges, good lacing, exactly what I want to see in a stout		s - big coffee aroma, solid roasted malt presence as well as some dark chocolate notes, alcohol hints there too		t - sweet bitterness up front, big bold coffee flavor dominates, but not in a bad way, supported nicely by bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt, finish is slightly bitter and dry, alcohol is hidden nicely, while coffee is really the star here, it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the flavors at all, very complex		m - very full-bodied and creamy, just enough carbonation for a stout, I agree with previous reviewers that the oatmeal undoubtedly contributes to the amazing mouthfeel, dry finish		d - surprisingly drinkable for a big stout, the alcohol is not overpowering at all and the complex and interesting taste kept me sipping		Breakfast Stout lived up to all the hype for me. Wonderfully complex stout that's surprisingly drinkable. I'm glad I have 12 more bottles of this to enjoy!";;;;;;;;;;
"Brown twist top bottle with no best by date. 	15 IBU's and 6.5% alc. by vol. Malt beverage brewed with cherry puree.		A: Light red, slightly cloudy with light pink head and minimal lacing.		S: Mild dark cherry/bing cherry scent. Not much of anything else.		T&M: Light body with medium to heavy carbonation. Tastes like cherries.... what a surprise. Very good flavor. Not too overpowering with a slightly dry aftertaste. Mild tangy and medicinal flavor, but overall better than average. 		I probably still prefer a good batch of Sam's cherry wheat to this, especially for the price. Founder's is a high quality brew though, and this is a very good ale.";;;;;;;;;;
"I drank this from a 12oz bottle into my Rochefort chalice.		The pours a deep gold that is almost orangy, it is a very intriguiing yet confusing color. The head is about one finger and white. It lasts about a minute and leaves a filmy white cover. The lacing is good. 		The aroma is very light, small amounts of hops but that's pretty much it.		The taste is bold explosion of flavor compared to the aroma. Is strong and complex with lots of soft hops and a little sweetness. 		The mouthfeel is light, highly drinkable.";;;;;;;;;;
"Saw this last year and thought it was a high price, at the time I actually thought it was. A year later I have come to realize the high prices of craft beer and purchased a four pack. Bottled 09/28/10.		A- Yellow orange, very clear with a nice frothy off-white head. Head retention is nice and I can see huge webs of lacing forming off the head already. A good amount of spotty lace randomly on the glass.		S- Hops forward. I get a lot of citrus and tropical fruit notes along with a good dose of pine and earthy notes. Slight yeast and malt in the background.		T- Flavorful but different from the aroma. Hops dominate lending a lot of pine, floral, citrus zest, grapefruit and earthy flavors. Malt breaks in just a tiny bit with caramel. Slight yeast bread notes in the finish.		MF- Very light but a nice creaminess makes up for it. The carbonation is in the low-moderate range and feels nice. A strong bitterness and even some warmth are sensations left on the palate in the finish.		DB- A very hoppy APA (whooda thunk it). To me it is comparable to the Centennial IPA but brings a better hop flavor to the table. Solid, drinks smoothly and easily.";;;;;;;;;;
"It's about time I review this beer but I've been too busy drinking it all week. I must say that this is one of my favorite beers of all time but has one big flaw--It is way too drinkable for being 12%		anyways...		Poured into a snifter, dark black with a thin quickly dissipating brown head		Smells quite tame, little chocolate, dark berries		Tastes very chocolatey with a smooth finish. Very little bite. As nemesis warms up it feels more like wine and chocolate being paired together. It's an all around beautiful experience.		Way too drinkable, I keep kicking these back. I have been paying five dollars for a decent sized snifter and have been very happy. It just tastes and feels so good that I am sad that this beer will only be made once.";;;;;;;;;;
"A nice sweet, malty beer...nothing complex, just a smooth refreshing drink that reveals no hint of 8.3 abv.		Pours an ice-tea colored brown. If held to the light, the very center of the beer is dense. Lots of light comes through on the sides. Tan head is average size with poor retention. Good lacing. Smell and taste are of caramel malts. Must be balanced very well because it is quite sweet but not cloying or too sweet for mass consumption. Mouthfeel is thick and rich. Drinkability is good. I finished off the 12 oz bottle quickly and could have enjoyed more.		This is one you have to be in the mood for, but if you are looking for something well made and sweet, this will do it for you.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours out deep brown with orange running up and down the stream and sits a gleaming deep cherrywood in the glass with a fair sized tan head, fading to a light skim with some minor lacings.		Smells rich and malty, nice and toasty. Dark brown sugar, mollases and toffee are sweet to the nose. Faint hints of rasins and dates, mild prune appearance. Bits of spice and brown leafy aromas sit on the sidelines, it's all about the malts here.		Tastes sweet from the get-go. Mollases all the way and dark, nearly scorched caramel. Dark brown toast flavor with bits of graininess. Some flavors of Asian pears push out from the maltiness, skins and all. Nice hop bitterness, light that is. Some peppery flavors emerge. Finishes with nice bitterness with lingering toastiness and spicy hop flavors.		Smooth and creamy in the mouth with soft, delicate carbonation. Medium-full body, a bit less than expected.		Nice, rich flavors with an attractive spicy touch. Good times had by all. Just tasty all the way.";;;;;;;;;;
Dull, faded orange. Thin off white head. Lace is minimal. Nice aroma of sweet pumpkin pulp. Not a lot of spicing going on the nose, but that's alright. Too many overspiced pumpkin ales on the market. The spicing comes through a little more on the palate. Cinamon and ginger lightly compliment the nice round pumpkin flavor. This is one of the better pumpkin beers I've had. Malts add some sweetness without cloying it up. Full body and flavorful. Nice beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"first sampling of this i had was at the E.B.F. N.O.T.B., and it was excellent, after not seeing it anywhere for a few months, i got aggravated....	finally, last night, i got some at the Sunset in Allston.		served in a 9 oz brandy snifter.		dark, thick, black, tan lacing around the top, there may have been a little head when they poured it, but if that was the case, it was gone by the time it made it to our table.		had to sip before swirling because they filled it right up to about a tenth of an inch below the top of the glass, after a nice first sip, i gave it a swirl and a deep sniff, it basically reminded me of breakfast...like the name would imply.... i got strong aromas of coffee (just after adding a little sugar), buried under that was a smell reminiscant of maple syrup and butter on top fresh, hot chocolate chip pancakes, and finally a little scent of maple bacon in the distant background. 		the taste is just excellent, strong coffee and maple syrup flavors, dark chocolate, and in the finish, i almost detect some thing that reminds me of the aftertaste of heavily buttered pancakes.		thick, rich, deep, chewy body, amazing, lightly carbonated, heavy mouthfeel...lightly syrupy.		very tasty, and easy to sip, but still not quite perfect on the drinkablility scale";;;;;;;;;;
Draft At brewpub.;;Poured a clear dark ruby color with an average creamy head that mostly lasted with good lacing.;;Good sweet fruit and alcohol aroma.;;Medium body with a sticky texture and soft carbonation.;;Heavy bittersweet flavor with a long bittersweet alcohol warming finish.;;The beer goes well with the pizza and basketball game.
"WOW! AMAZING! This is a truly great stout. 	Pours a super dark chocolate black with a light chocolate colored head that sits there all the way thru the drinking experience. Smells of rich mocha. Its aroma gives off a breakfast vibe, coffee, with a hint of chocolate and cream. The taste is even better. Rich and chewy coffee and chocolate flavors. Incredibly smooth, with a lovely coating in the mouth. This could be a breakfast as well as a dessert! Two or three of these would be the perfect way to end an evening.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to dontcostnuthin for sending this one my way. Review from notes.		A: Pours an inky/oily dark black. A one finger tan/mocha colored head forms on top, with decent retention and no lacing. 		S: I immediately get the sweet oats. There is also some roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, and a little bit of hops. 		T: Very roasty flavor with the oats coming through as well, but not as strong as the aroma indicated, and not as sweet either. Nice mixture of coffee, licorice, and a little bit of molasses. 		M: Full bodied and on the thicker side, but very smooth. Has a bitter-sweet finish.		O: A solid RIS, but not my favorite. From what I have seen a bit pricey as well, even though I got this one in a BIF. If I found it for the right price I would certainly get it again though.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into my Stone IRS tulip		A - Inky black with a small head that quickly dissipates to a fat ring around the glass. Moderate lacing.		S - Dark roasted malt, molasses, licorice and chocolate.		T - Pretty close to the nose, with big notes of coffee coming into play. There's a bit of hop bitterness that really balances this one out, very complex.		M - Very creamy with a medium-heavy body and moderate, ""prickly"" carbonation.		D - About as drinkable as a 10.5% AV stout can be, this is a great example of the style and is absolutely perfect on a cool fall evening. Another great beer from Founders!";;;;;;;;;;
"very dirty and hazy ruby red and orange, light head. basically no retention		floral amarillo with slight pine and grapefruit.		a light sweet citrus bitterness, mostly at the finish. very floral throughout. slight pine flavor with a light malty biscuit like backbone. 		i poured this myself, not sure if i killed the carbonation but it was there when i did the partial fill. slight to little bite, pretty full bodied.		this is sooo easy to drink and has tons of flavors going on. quite glad i got to try this.";;;;;;;;;;
"Picked this one up just because it's a Pennsylvania brew, I'm all about the locals, now.		Appearance: Pours a crystal clear golden yellow color. Head was initially big and fluffy white, but is now a thin layer. Lacing is quite nice.		Smell: Hints of raw honey (one thing I actually know the smell of, I have a big piece of cut comb honey in my kitchen), also a bit of a malty/grainy aroma.		Taste: Sweet, malty, long lasting finish on this one that kinda evens out the taste.		Mouthfeel: Not a big, chewy mouthful of a beer, I think that's more the style than anything. Carbonation is spot on, alcohol is subdued, but noticeable.		Drinkability: I'm going to get a few more of these, not just cause its a PA brew, but because this is one tasty beer. Very nicely done. I'm going to be sad when this glass is empty.";;;;;;;;;;
"I choose this as my complementary pint at the Black Party.		Sizable thick, marshmallow-like mocha head which doesn't go anywhere while you drink. Really just gorgeous looking. The liquid is black with brown highlights when held up to the light.		Smells delicious! Hazelnut and coffee. The taste echoes the smell, but with subtle hints of tart cherries hovering in the background. The mouthfeel is thick yet very smooth. Quite quaffable.		My relationship with this brew is kind of funny. I first tried it when I had only been drinking good beer for about a month (and consequently knew absolutely nothing about it). I hated Frangelic Stout. This beer is the reason I decided that I ""hated stouts""... a year and a half (and a lot of research) later, this is by far my favorite stout. Until after I tried a bunch of other stouts could I recognize the true genius of this beer. This brew is very flavorful, without being forceful. It's just a nice, easy to enjoy brew. I love the hazelnut flavor now! Anyway, just another lesson in how much a person can learn if they apply themselves. This kind of story is why I didn't start writing reviews until I felt I had enough experience, and a developed-enough palate to do a decent job at it. Well, anyway, thank you again, Founders! I owe so much of my beer education to you!";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from the can into a tulip. Nice pour, perfect carbonation, nice medium head, solid lacing.	Aroma is a perfect IPA balance of malt and citrusy piney hops. Taste matches aroma perfectly, this is a very balanced IPA.	One weakness for me is the mouthfeel is the slightest bit thin. For all the flavor and aroma I would like it a bit ""chewier"". 	Very solid IPA.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Pours a slightly hazy orange/amber color with a small fizzy head that rises and falls very quickly to leave behind a fizzy island and a thin ring. No lacing left behind on the edges of the glass. 		S: This smells great ... roasted pumpkin, cinnamon, allspice, and some nutmeg. Unlike some other pumpkin beers I've had this year, the aroma of this one is complex, yet balanced, with just the right amount of fall spices.		T: Starts out kind of bland with some fresh pumpkin and a slight earthiness. The middle ground intensifies a little with some nutmeg and a but of fresh apples. The finish come alive even more with cinnamon, nutmeg, and some clove. The finish is really nice. Again, not overly spicy, with a great pumpkin flavor (more fresh pumpkin than roasted).		M: I knew from the appearance that this had a ton of bubbles. Highly carbonated that I thought would work at first, but really takes away from the beer. This beer tries to be creamy on the front end, but it becomes prickly on the tongue due to the overwhelming carbonation. Slightly drying at the finish as well.		D: This is a great pumpkin beer. I love a pumpkin beer that can balance the pumpkin and the spices, and this one balanced the two better than any other I've had this year. If the mouthfeel was better (carbonation lower), this would be really drinkable. Unfortunately, not the case. That's ok, though, because this is the best one I've had this year to date. Trying a good bit tomorrow though, so we'll see how it holds up.";;;;;;;;;;
"120z stubby bottle into a chalice. 		A: Absolutely black with a one finger mocha head. Tiny carb bubbles dancing just under the head. Lacing is nice.		S: Bourbon is the first scent that enters my nostrils. Followed by coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, and roasted malt. Very nice.		T: Bourbon is the first thing I noticed here too. Also expresso, a touch of oak, bitter dark chocolate, and some dark fruit. The hop profile is muted but here also. This is a complex beer.		M: Very thick, and oily, but not overly so. I detect little carbonation. I've tasted plenty of stouts, and this one seems spot on for the style in my opinion.		D: It's hard to believe that this is an 11+% beer! I've had 9% beers that don't hide the alcohol this well. This is a slow sip and savor beer, but each sip begs you to take another. I only wish I would have picked up more.		This is a fantastic stout fully deserving of all the accolades it receives.";;;;;;;;;;
"Grabbed a few ""swigs"" from my wife's glass. Nice amber color, not much bite, good malt, just a good drinking beer. It went down good with the food I was drinking. Although I am not an ""amber"" man, I could certainly drink this again.";;;;;;;;;;
This brew is probably the best I've had from this brewery. This brew poured out as a really nice black color with a creamy looking brown head on top. The smell of the brew is chocolaty and roasted with some light sweetness on the nose too. The taste has a little bit of some coffee like flavors along with a sweet roasted malt character in there too. The mouthfeel is creamy, thick and dry in that order. Overall this beer is really nice. Worth a try for sure.;;;;;;;;;;
"A: cloudy golden straw w/orange highlights. nice white head and lacing.	S: fresh peaches dominate, with some wheat beer notes underneath.	T: lightly sweet bready malt, peaches. has a lightly sourish twang from the peaches and wheat. not too puckerish though. finishes dry and crisp with peach flavor lingering. the peach character is just right in this one, while allowing just enough of the base beer to show through.	M: light-bodied, frothy, crisp. a good summer beer.	D: one of the better fruit beers i've had, not too sweet, not too sour, not cough syrupy at all. a light bodied refresher and certainly worth a try if you like peaches. 	i like this stuff and i'm not afraid to admit it. very well done.";;;;;;;;;;
"Received bottles from grub and Unclejedi...drank one of them, saving the other.	This has a tremendous reputation, so I'll try to remain calm.	Pours black, silky, some dark burgundy/ruby hints. Head comes to about a 1/2 finger. Medium brown. I think I served it a bit cold, we'll see how it holds up.	Wow, the smell is rich coffee grounds, roasted coffee beans, some prune and anise. Chocolate seems to linger, but not a lot. Alcohol? I don't detect it. Man, this coffee is strong.	Taste is fantastic. Starts as expected with the coffee. A slight intensity is followed by a move toward more caramel and whisky, hint of alcohol. Then it moves to a slight bite of anise and hops, earth tones. Then it moves on to the chocolate. A rich dark chocolate aftertaste, clean and silky. Which leads me to the feel. Silk, not really heavy, not velvet. A smoothness to it. Real nice. Drinks very well for the style, abv, and for me.	What a brew!";;;;;;;;;;
"Received in trade from TexIndy, Thanks for the opportunity.		Pours a solid black with a smallish tan head that doesn't visit for very long. Smells of chocolate syrup and roast, slight perfume aroma and a bit of alcohol as it warms. Taste is roasty and filled with chocolates. Hop presence is felt mid to finish as well as a bit of alcohol bite, which then gives way to a roast bitterness. Body is thick, mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, carbonation is low but adequate. Its a good Imp Stout, hoppier than I like. I wish I had more so I could lay some down.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours out to an amberish straw with a decent sized head that subsides moderately to a 1 finger head.		Smell is fairly malty for this type of beer. The hops are pretty faint, but there, floral.		The taste is very mellow, and pretty balanced. Hops are rather mellow and are more bitter than spicy. Fairly clean finish, though maybe not as fast as some other lagers.		Mouthfeel is rather smooth. Thick for a lager, very low on the carbonation.		Drinkability....		Now I have to say this is a beer that defines the murky term of what drinkability means. I might not be able to put it into words, but is this a very drinkable beer? YES!		I will definitely be on the lookout for this again.";;;;;;;;;;

"2008. 		A - Into da snifta. Pours a deep, clear amber/mahogany. The frothy tan head quickly settles to a wispy layer. Minimal, yet present lacing.		S - Smells like barrel-aged Dirty Bastard. Heavy carmelized sugar, brown sugar, bourbon, booze. German chocolate cake. A malty monster.		T - A nice little treat, and a great dessert beer. Runs all over the place... molasses, brown sugar, barrel, bourbon, chocolate caramel torte. Nice alcohol warmth, and a relatively hoppy finish for a Wee Heavy.		M - Great medium-heavy body, as well as a creamy, fine carbonation.		D - At 10.2%, it's the only limiter. This is a fantastic offering from the boys at Founders.		Notes: This is as good as last year... and that makes me happy. I was a little nervous seeing as I wasn't a fan of this year's Breakfast Stout, but this got me reconsidering.		A fantastic brew from a fantastic brewery.";;;;;;;;;;
"Color is a rusted orange murk with a slim, fake orange-tan head of smooth foam. Brief lasting, glaring lace in thick, short strings stick across the glass.		Fat and juicy aroma with evident alcohol laced with a pinch of mint. Hops juices are there in full swing with dark citrusy piths, oils, and peels. Semi bittering on the nose too as a fairly large backing of caramel malt keeps a nice balance.		Taste mirrors the aroma well with a nice balancing act of dark citrusy oils and caramel malt. Very Barelywine-esk in character.	Finish is what brings this full circle. It takes a while to develope as its front and middle is moslty the malt base leveling the playing field for the team of hops to take their positions on the palate. Lots of piney bittering tones mesh with some dark citric hop oils. Big warmth at the end. Whoof da, wow does this stuff have some late kick too it. So watch out and hold on. Its a wonderful ride.		Feel is oily and rich with a medium body. Soothingly bold and smooth. Again, much like a Barleywine here. Nice hoppy finish and alcoholic stealth. Seems to have some areas missing for a beer this big, perhaps the complexity isn't up to par with some other 2IPA's but its stellar for any beer whatever you want to call it.		A fairly big taster and holds its own with most big West Coast goodies. Not a sessioning beer. A hoppy nectar sipper if anything.";;;;;;;;;;
"2011 Devil Dancer, bottled 6-17-11, consumed from a modern day tulip.		A - hazy, orange-ish gold, real nice head.	S - Dank! It smells like a pine forest in March or a pile of soaking wet hay, if you please.	T - Dominates the palate, hoppy and malty to the extreme. For 12% ABV (the taproom says 13%, thanks a lot Ohio) the alcohol is not very prominent. This would be excellent with some spicy Thai food.	M - creamy, with some zing from the carbonation.	O - I'm somewhat biased because I love this beer, it is definitely not for the faint of tongue. For me, this really epitomizes a triple IPA.		Cheers.";;;;;;;;;;
"Reviewed on 22 November 2010. Much thanks to 'brewseum' for sending this one! He drove waaay out of his way to obtain this one.		I drank this right out of the package that came 15 minutes ago. Split between two standard snifters and shared with a family member. Temperature is between 45 and 50F, 1-finger head reduces to a pretty film, lacing is runny. Color is slightly cloudy deep orange.		Wow, the alcohol is HOT on this beer! Reminds me of the hotness of DFH 120 minute, begging the question -- would this [IPA] age well at 12%? The beer is dry-hopped for 29 days with 10 varieties of hops, and ends up with 112 IBUs. Awesome. The carbonation is a little heavier than I would expect a 12% beer. Aroma is.... malty. Heavy, alcoholic malts. Taste? Heavy, alcoholic malts. Very bitter. It may sound like I'm beating down on this beer, but sipping this like a port wine makes this much more enjoyable. Yeah, maybe I could sit for a few more minutes to sip and sniff this beer, but guessing ingredients would be a dart throw, and I never win cricket. I think I'll try to cellar one of these after sending the rest to share with my friends. I'd like to see if flavors develop and alcohol loses bite. It may seem like my score is low, but I enjoyed this beer.";;;;;;;;;;
Bomber aged well over a year. Pours black with a large, thick, nearly charred oak colored head. Decent retention and some lacing left behind after dwindling down to a ring of a fine bubbles around the edge of the glass. Aromas of dark fruits (prunes, figs, raisin) mesh with earthy and herbal tobacco leaves. Layers of roastiness and chocolate liqueur also waft up. The taste brings the same load of succulent dark fruits up front, plus some concord grapes. Some of the herbal and tobacco notes add complexity on the midpalate before the finish brings out a bittersweet cocoa, cookies and biscuits, and some warming and herbal liqueur. Full bodied, slick, with a moderate yet fine carbonation. The taste both intense and outstanding, with remarkable drinkability for such a full flavored brew. One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts on the market, and better than most of the hyped up limited releases.;;;;;;;;;;
Pours a three finger off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a little lace. Clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is sweet malty with hints of molasses, unusual red. $4.45 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma.;;;;;;;;;;
"Here's an unusual beer. 500lbs of raspberries were used to produce this fruit lambic-like beer. Has a murky light strawberry colour to it with a thin pink lace -- like a wine cooler. Clean nose, soft-raspberry aroma and a touch of fruity candy. Strong wheat flavour, crisp, tart and puckering with huge raspberry flavours and a limey / salty citrus bite.		A bit one-dimensional (a fruit overload on the senses), but extremely interesting. Kudos to the brewer for making something so outrageous.";;;;;;;;;;
"[Best served in a Pint galss]		Poured a deep rich black with a large light brown frothy head that lasted about 3/4 of the way though the glass and produced some really excellent lacing. The aroma was strong of burnt dark chocolate malts, a medium leathery yeast with notes of roasted coffee, molasses, some chared oak and a mild dose of bourbon with a hint of vanilla. It tasted, (WOW) pretty awesome with a nice bitter coffee flavor from the onset and then slowly maturing into a nice chocolate, molasses, coffee medley with an ever so slight whiskey finish. Mouthfeel was kind of bold but not as full as I would have thought, more medium than full in body. The texture was absolutly smooth and creamy with a flat carbonation. Overall an outstanding stout, although I would have like a little more body and a tad more of the bourbon flavor.";;;;;;;;;;
"On cask: Dry hopped with Cascade		This offering pours a cloudy dark maroon with hardly any visable light. It leaves a creamy thick tan head that stays with this brew. The smell is fantastic fresh earthy hops like taking a big breath of a hand full of hops. The taste starts smooth with hop bitterness balanced by a creamy, caramel, mouthfeel that finishes sweet with a herbal presence. This is a another solid offering from the CBC.";;;;;;;;;;
"Had on tap at Redbones. Thanks to fellow BA's for posting that it was being served there!!		A: Jet black pour with 1/2 inch dark tan head. Nice lacing.		A: Incredible blend of choc, roast, malt, maple syrup, molasses and vanilla. 		T: Taste is same as aroma but with a little alcohol (well-hidden for 9%) and some hops in the backend. The amazing thing is how all the flavors combine together. It's just a 'big' blend of all the flavors with none really dominating!		M: absolutely smooth and creamy with just the right amount of body. I've always felt that Kate the Great was one of smoothest stouts I've had--this one is right there with it. 		D: see above. The smoothness and the well-hidden alcohol make this very drinkable.		This was a fantastic drinking experience. A true standout beer. They need to start bottling this stuff!";;;;;;;;;;
"The pour is golden with a hint of red. Not much head and could be mistaken for a flat beer.		Smelling this makes me think I'm about to eat some grapefruit. My mouth is salivating at the thought.		It seems that this beer has 3 distinct sections, Pine Hops, Malt, and Citrus Hops. The pine is very subtle and leads to a chalky malt middle. The finish is the best as the aftertaste is bitter grapefruit. I wouldn't say that the flavors blend incredibly well but the sum of them is pleasant.		This beer is medium to full bodied and finishes a touch dry, more dry feeling for a DIPA.		Drinking this is pretty easy for a double and hides the 9%+ pretty well. This is good.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a clear, well carbonated amber, with a two finger rocky off-white head.	Citrus hop aroma covering toasted biscuit. Floral note.	Nicely bittered citrus taste, lemon and grapefruit - zest like. Toasted biscuit, bit of a light caramel note.	Medium bodied, smooth.	Very pleasant to drink session beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"OK, OK, I know the style doesn't really exist, but the bottle says Triple IPA on it. It's too bad there's no freshness date on this - I'm curious to know how much time it's had in the bottle. More on that later, I suppose. First things first! Thanks OHLRangers for the opportunity to try this one out! I'd never have guessed that I wanted it until you sent it to me!		It's sort of like... A cross between an American Barleywine and an English one, at this point. But... Maybe that's 'cause it's not really young. Um. What I mean is that I don't get a lot of hop nose, here, and that makes me think it's been aged at least a few months. Which is fine - it comes out at more of a barleywine - but weird with the style name. See?		So, it has the residual sweetness of an English B'wine and the hop bitterness of a 'Merican one. Smooth and easy to drink! Good thing I've only got this one :) Wait. Bummer, I've only got this one :(";;;;;;;;;;
"I bought this at a liquor store near my home in Maine, 12 pack for $14 yikes, very expensive for what it was. the appear was a plain yellow, the smell was light and nearly non-existent. The taste was light and somewhat crisp, considering the lack of smell. A little too much carbonation for me, but the drinkability was very good considering the amount of carbonation. 		I'd drink it again, but it would need to be cheaper or I would have to be disparate.";;;;;;;;;;
"(Note: This is one of the new canned versions. If this were the bottle, it would be much lower, sadly)		Ah, the original pale lager. For years it's languished away in green bottles, but now it's available in 16oz cans. I've enjoyed in on tap for some time, but have avoided those green bottles like the plague. The only time I've had it in one, it was pretty much a Heineken clone.	Pours a wonderful golden color. Not too light or greenish - just liquid gold.	Smell is of floral noble hops, grain, and lager yeast. No off smells at all, which for an imported pils isn't something you encounter every day.	Taste starts off sweet and creamy, and finishes with floral hops. Not too bitter, actually, just a nice flavor. Some other Czech brews (and German ones, too) have a hoppier bite - but this one is shockingly balanced and goes down almost too easy.	It's creamy and thick, but still makes for a great all-year beer. 	Scrap the green bottles - these new cans provide a fresh taste that I really enjoy. Up there with Bitburger as far as imported pils goes.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: It's clear red in color; there's a small bit of pink head and not much visible carbonation.";S: There are faint aromas of cherries in the nose.;"T: There is a great balance between sweet and tart flavors; the tartness of the cherries really stands out but isn't overpowering because of the strong presence of sweetness from the malts. The cherries don't taste as sweet as Lindemans Kriek and the fruity flavor seems more natural.";M: It feels light- to medium-bodied on the palate and a little bubbly.;D: The beer is definitely easy to drink and goes down smoothly. It's a pretty good beer for this particular style.;;;;;;
"Pours a hazy copper/red with a nice little hint of a head. Sticks to the glass nicely. 	Smells of massive amounts of fruit. Apples dominate, raisins, cherries, dates and a mild hint of citrus.	Taste is just like the smell. Tons of fruit up front, sweet and smooth. Candy like sweetness in the middle and a lingering dark finish complete this extremely complicated beer. 	Feels smooth with very little carbonation, maybe a bit thin but with a taste like this I can forgive a little thinness. 	It's really too bad they only made this once.";;;;;;;;;;
"The bottle is labeled 2009, so I guess this beer has a couple years on it so far...this is a good thing. Let's try it...		Appearance: Pours a moderately cloudy orange brown color with a small head after an aggressive pour. There really is no lace left on the glass after drinking.		Aroma: Right after the pour I got the typical ""C"" hops along with a healthy amount of light crystal malt. Afterward, the aroma turned a little more toward the sweetness than you normally get for this style.		Taste: The flavor is actually quite drinkable for this style. I am getting a decent amount of hops in the initial components of the flavor, but the malt comes in quickly along with the light carbonation to almost wipe the palate clean. There is a decent amount of bitterness, and I think that the reason that they are such a big player in the flavor is because this beer has less crystal malt than typical beer of this style. 		Opinion: This is an alright beer overall. I don't know...it doesn't really have a lot of ""depth"" that a lot of beers in this style do. There is hops there in the flavor and finish, but they don't really challenge the malt or anything, but co-exist. I guess the beauty of this style is contrast and I didn't really know that until now. You expect a Barley Wine to be an assault on your palate. This one is a bit like a balanced double IPA. It doesn't suck, and there isn't any fermentation flaws...but I wouldn't go here regularly when I am looking for a Barley Wine, that's for sure.";;;;;;;;;;
"Looks very golden with a thick white head that went away slowly.Nice lacing on the glass.Leaves rings on the glass as you drink it.		Smells like grass.		Some hop taste and your typical pils flavor.		Mouthful attacks your tongue and goes down smooth.		Very good,I was looking forward to a Pilsner and this one is very good for the style.Im glad I bought it.Kudos to Stoudts for making this fine brew.";;;;;;;;;;
This beer poured a nice medium amber color and formed a off white bubbly head that left some lace in a circular pattern.  The was medium amount of carbonation present.  The aroma was of spice, malt and a slight hint of alcohol.  The flavor was of malt, spice and a hint of clove.  The body was touch light for this style, but not bad.  The finish was a little astrigent and had elements of the alcohol.  A nice beer and one of their better ones.;;;;;;;;;;
Pours dark ruby brown in color. There is a bit of a frothy ring of head around the perimeter of the glass. Smell is huge and robust. Plenty of toffee and caramel malts. Just the way a barleywine should be. Taste is more of the abundance of toffee and malt. Just a hint of hops in the end. Perfect balance to round out the beer. Huge and viscous mouthfeel. This has all the qualities of a world class barleywine. Everything that I look for in a barleywine. The ABV is so well hidden that I can't believe it.;My only complaint is that this was an anniversary beer and not a regular offering. Founders seriously needs to consider making this at least as a seasonal.;;;;;;;;;
Pours a hazy orange with little head that has practically no retention. Smell is a powerful combination of orange and hops. The upfront taste is dominated by a fruity citrus blast followed by a tongue twisting assault of hop goodness. The sweet alcohol finish is a bit of a downer, however. I'd classify this one as a noble effort by a great brewery, but I'll take a super hoppy DIPA over this TIPA anytime.;;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance- thing white lacing along the the top of the surface, no carbonation to be seen, nice amber red color,		Smell- very slight malt and nice citrus and fresh hop smell, grapefruit and floral hope smell		Taste- sharp citrus hops and a long bitter finish, very nice hop flavor with a very slight twinge of malt, nicely and strongly hopped but it doesn't cross the line as to becoming to bitter, long enjoyable finish		Mouthfeel- creamy and smooth with very little carbonation, very nice feel		Drinkability- Highly drinkable thats for darn sure, I find this to be an excellent example of what i expect from an IPA, the finish is fantastic and the balance is very much what I enjoy, walks that fine line of what I look for as being strongly hopped but with still a balance to leave me wanting more then one, definitely a beer I will have many more times and recommend as a great example of the style";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a tulip. Pours a hazy honey color with thick tiny bubbled white heading that leaves lacing throughout the tasting.		Smell is very fruity some bubblegum pulls through a nice grapefruit detected towards the ending. Excellent balance of maltiness and hops.		Taste is very hoppy deceptive from the smell. The palate just explodes from hoppiness . Very alive and an amazing taste. Again amazing balance and the alcohol is well suited.		Mouth is thick an creamy medium bodied,great carbonation. Mouthfeel that leaves your mouth watering and wanting more.		Drink even for a 10% ABV it is still very drinkable.Like I said very well suited beer that you can definetly have a few of them.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle, Duvel snifter		A: Almost black, dark brown. Head was slow to build, but developed a two finger mocha head. 		S: coffee, roasted malts, bitter chocolate		T: More coffee than probably any porter that I have had. Alot of nuttiness, bitter dark chocolate, slight dark fruits. Nice and smooth, ""sexy"" as Founders puts it. Its only improving as the glass warms.		M: Creamy, approaching stout territory. Not quite, though.		D: I could drink a few of these easily. Balanced, lower ABV, and pretty cheap.		Overall an excellent example of the style. Its a little heavy on the coffee but Im often a fan of coffee characteristics in beer, so I wont knock it at all for that.";;;;;;;;;;
"Great stuff. Haven't seen much Founder's out here and picked this up at my local. NOt a scottish ale expert by any means so it take for a grain of salt (note: other than Middle Ages Kilt Tilter and Duke of Winship I've never bought a scottish ale twice...until this one).	Appearance: Dark reddish brown, light tan head that lingers. 	Smell: Sweet, malts, caramels	Taste: Delicious? Sweet, a little sugary, can't pick up too much hops but also not expecting to.	Mouthfeel: Wow. Best part of the beer hands down. Medium bodied but clean and crisp with a nice finish. Velvety and creamy. 		Overall a really great beer.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured from a 12oz bottle to a snifter.;A: Deep Amber/ Rusty with lots of yeast floaties. Very thin head that was gone withing seconds. No lacing on the glass either.;S: Initial smell is Oak. It seems this smell gets stronger as the beer warms up.;T: Oak with a slight warming feel from alcohol. Not any hop charecter. This beer is all malt with oak.;M: Sticky Thick and warm.;D: This beer drinks pretty easy for almost weighing in @ 10%. One of the biggest charecteristics is the Oak flavor.;;;;;
Golden yellow in color that has a bright white head that is very bubbly but dies down quick. Leaves behind good lacing. Semi sweet malts up front with some bready qualities. Leafy tones are there two. There is a good hop balance that carries over into the aftertaste leaving it a little dry. Crisp and clean all the way through. An easy drinker for all. If not for the price I'd stock up. Good for all occations.;;;;;;;;;;
"Beautiful dark mahagoney with a cream colored head. Very hoppy, resinous, alcoholic, and sweet smell. Moving on to taste this beer delivers. Hoppy and malty sweet, dark fruits, hops and malt with a hoppy, resinous dryer finish.		I really like this newer black DIPA/Barleywine style as it melds so many great flavors and smells. It seems to be growing in popularity and Founders has produced a winner here.		I am definately going to seek this out again. It seemd like it will age well and is certainly far more drinkable out of the gate than last years release.";;;;;;;;;;
"90 IBUs	Bottled 11/27/2009; Sampled 12/28/2010; 12 oz bottle poured into a 25 oz snifter.		Pours thick and tar black with an excellently formed very very dark brown head. The head retention is great and the lacing is fantastic too. Looks just as good as any other, or better!		Molasses, sweet alcohol, roast, and massive coffee notes stand out; it should be noted that the coffee, although strong, is nowhere as strong as in the Breakfast series.		Coffee forward taste with a very bright & coffee-like acidity. Bitter on the palate, and with good amount of roast too.		Silky mouthfeel. Carbonation is appropriately low; full of roast but still not harsh; finishes sweet but can't be called cloying over a reasonable serving size; and warming. 		In my memory, fresh Founders Imperial is more coffee forward and in that sense it has aged for worse.		Overall, an excellent stout and it's tough to choose any other over this, within the same style.";;;;;;;;;;
"Served into a standard pint glass from the bottle. The beer was allowed to warm to approximatley 63-65 degrees		Appearance: Pours a cloudy copperish hue, with a minimal head that only rose to about a finger and a half. No beading can be seen through the mirk(I think I decanted too much sediment.) Tons of lacing in effect throughout the quaff.		Smell: This brew smelled very malty and sweet at a lower temperture but became much more citric/hoppy as it warmed. Pine resin and a mouth watering orange candy aroma are noted. Maybe a touch doughy as well.		Taste: WOW! Not what I expected at all. The hops are very understated while the malt takes a front seat. I was fully expecting to have my face ripped off with hop bitterness, but that is not the case. This is a very balanced DIPA. The hop bill is more citrus rather than that pine resin/peppery sting that alot of the Northwestern hopbombs display. Some caramel is noted beside that doughy malt character that was in the aroma. The alcohol is masked nicley for a 10%. A very smooth finish with the hops lingering while not being overly bitter.		Mouthfeel: Very full and sticky in nature. Not syrupy, but if this beer were much bigger it would be in Aunt Jemima territory. There is ample carbonation to off-set the fatness of this beer. Catching the odd alcohol vapor as it warms. Very balanced.		Overall: This is a very nice DIPA in my opinion. This beer could stand to be a bit more crisp on the toungue but even so it is a beautiful concoction on its own. I wish more DIPA's were as balanced as this. My first experience with a Stoudts product and hopefully not the last. Drink up!!!			Cheers2Beers";;;;;;;;;;
"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a pint glass. There appears to be no freshness date on the label.		Appearance: The body has a deep dark brown, nearly black color. It is very dark and nearly opaque. On top sits a small one finger thick foam head. It is tan in color and quickly settles down to a thin wispy layer that just covers the top. Lacing is minimal and slippery.		Smell: There is a firm aroma of sweet roasted/toasted malts with notes of fresh brewed coffee and just a hint of dark chocolate.		Taste/Palate: There is a solid sweet roasted malty character with a good balance of toasted bready notes and dark roasted bitter coffee notes. As the beer warms hints of dark chocolate and mild spicy hops sneaks in there here and there as well as some mellow almost brandy like alcohol notes. The palate has a solid medium feel with mellow balanced carbonation.		Notes: This is just a good solid stout.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 500ml bottle similar to the one in the picture into an imperial pint glass. This German lager had a clear light straw color with lots of fine carbonation winding its way up to a substantial bright white head that clung to life for a few minutes before receding down to a thin collar.	The nose sported the sweet aromas of grainy malts, floral hops and some orchard fruits like apples or pears. The dominant aroma came from the malts, though. Light-bodied and refreshing, Barock Hell had a nice clean malty taste, somewhat biscuity in nature, that easily stood up to the moderate amount of hops bitterness and mild level of spiciness in the finish. The fruitiness persisted throughout also, with light notes of apple and citrus making brief forays to the realm of detectability.	Overall, this proved to quite drinkable and enjoyable. One of this style that I'd be willing to come back to.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a ceramic mug at the Bramwell Oktoberfest. Decent head, some lacing. Dark brown in color.		Malt dominates nose, slightly toasted, kinda sweet. Pleasant.		Taste and mouthfeel reminded me of Shiner Bock and Newcastle. It was eerie, actually. It was like a Shiner/Newcastle clone. That's not a bad thing, but not anything to really jump for joy about, either. Perhaps a little drier than those, but real close.		Nice drinkability. Refreshing, dry, some sweetness, not cloying. Could drink more than one and be happy.		Bottom line: Good beer. Not spectacular, but still worth a glass or two.";;;;;;;;;;
"A huge, balanced, stoutlike American Porter.		---		A: Opaque black with burgundy edges when held to a light.		S: Quite a nosefull... lots of deeply charred malt, coffee, prune, cocoa... much like a stout.		T: Matches the nose well with perfectly balanced sweet burnt malt and fruity hops. 		M: Pretty much perfect... creamy, heavy, like a stout.		D: As drinkable as can be... glides down easy and sits like a meal.";;;;;;;;;;
"From recently found old review (around Feb i think)		A - Ruby almost amber	S - RASPBERRY. like sticking your nose in a freshly picked bushel. very fresh, nothing fake/syrupy. Slight yeasty 	T - sweet raspberries puckering into a tartness that morphs into grapefruit on the dry finish	M - impressive - creamy and threatens to become syrupy but the carbonation lifts it off the tongue just in time. 	D - very drinkable - tastes like spiked punch, but not very many identifiable beerlike qualities. I got a little bit of wheaty berliner weiss flavor somewhere in there, but not very evident. A good drink but not a great beer, massively overpriced. Trying Rubaus soon";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Strawberry blonde, with a creamy, tight lacing that hung on tight.		Smell: Very herbal and piney, I wouldn't venture out to say Nugget or Chinook, and Pat the brewer didn't want to name the types he used, but he did say it was a mix of West coast favorites. I don't think it was cascade, not citrusy enough. It also had remnants of ripe red fruits...		Taste: Just malty enough, discreet carbonation, smooth as silk, respectable hop prick that clings on the tongue and doesn't let go. In a land not known for their IPAs, this one stands out.";;;;;;;;;;
Like the Stoudts brews, and this is my latest try. This beer has a scarlet and rust color, but not much head -- sorta laces the glass ring. Aroma is dry crackers and other malts, not much in the hops department. Taste is quite malty but with a nice bitter backbone and after taste, a bit more bitter than most of this style. Hoppy and a little dry. A good brew.;;;;;;;;;;
"Had on tap at Smokin' Joe's on Pittsburgh's Southside. I have to say, after one taste, this was the best tasting Stout I have ever had.		A: Pours a thick black color, with a moderate one finger foam head that sticks around for most of the taste. There is sufficient lacing as well.		S: Lots of chocolate, coffee, vanilla with a small amount of alcohol. Extremely sweet smelling.		T: The malt sweetness is tremendous. The coffee flavor blends nicely with the chocolate and vanilla so that sweetness is not as overpowering. Great balance! This was extremely delicious.		M: Leaves a semi sweet thick creamy feel on the palate. 		D: This beer is extremely easy to drink. Despite an 8% ABV, I could enjoy several quite easily in a sitting.";;;;;;;;;;
"The third installment in the Sheltowee line from Liquor Barn. This beer is supposed to be a mimic of New Belgium's Fat Tire.		This Amber ale is light in color and in body. The malt base is minimal with almost no hop characteristic. An excellent session beer to be enjoyed in quantity. A great beer to try to convert domestic drinkers to craft brews.		The recipe has be altered though giving the beer a stronger malt characteristic and a richer body. Though still a lighter bodied amber ale, the added malt gives this ale more flavor and makes it much more enjoyable.		Try the Gloomsucker Black Ale if you can....";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours an exceptionally ruby hue with a thin head into my glass. The hue is perfect for the style. 		Smoky peat textures jump out in the nose with a heady dose of alcohol heat that's nowhere near overwhelming.		The mouth follows the nose and not surprisingly, discovers a drinkable mix of peat malt and alcohol heat. Keep in mind, this is 8.5% and it packs quite a punch. 		Luckily for me, it's mellowed out enough to where the alcohol stays in its' place, allowing the malt to shine. 		This is one of the more complex wee heavies I've had in a while. Generally, I don't drink a lot of this style but I believe it fits well with my current look and feel of things.";;;;;;;;;;
"I was going to hold off reviewing this until I'd had a few of them, but I can't.		It pours out pitch black, with a thin head. It fades a bit, leaving swirls of bubbles and leaves little bits of lace all the way down. Looks about like what I'd expect, but a bigger head would've really made me fall in love. The smell, it can't get any better. First you get wood, just wonderful wood, mixed in with a brilliant bourbon smell, a bit of alcohol. Then there's the coffee, roasted a bit burnt, but very nice. Then you really smell vanilla and chocolate, BIG vanilla sometimes, and really beautiful dark chocolate others. I mean, there's nothing else I could ask for, and the best part, the very best part, is every time I put my face up to the glass, there's something new, and something great. The taste is wonderful, just like the smell. It's totally different from the average stout, but everything is there. First you get a very woody, earth coffee taste, like bourbon mixed with fresh brewed coffee. Then comes the vanilla, and its very nice as it sweetens, and is almost creamy like good vanilla ice cream, and finishes like a very smooth dark chocolate bar, and just a bit of an alcohol after burn. But the alcohol mostly warms. The mouthfeel is just perfect, smooth and creamy, with infinite complexity. I was just fascinated at every sip, and couldn't put it down. I wouldn't put it down under any circumstances, and is possible the greatest drinker at 10% I've ever had. Really incredible. Really, really incredible. You must find it and taste it. This is exactly what everyone should shoot for if making a bourbon barrel aged stout.";;;;;;;;;;
"Unbelievable, just drank back to back with PTE, Green Flash Imperial, Dark Horse Double crooked Tree, New Holland Mad Hatter Imperial, and Bells Hopslam and all four of us preferred the founders, especially for the price.		Great Aroma, Mouthfeel and taste. I wish this was a beer that easily cloneable.";;;;;;;;;;
Bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a big fluffy tiny bubbled tan head. The aroma is slightly malty, light roast coffee, touch of smoke, and milk chocolate. Medium mouthfeel. The roast is nicely balanced with a sublt sweetness that lasts throughout. Ends rather dryly and cleanly. Has a smooth velvety quality to it that is really nice. Fairly sweet and I could see how this would detract from the overall enjoyment but I actually like it as fan of sweet stoutts/porters. No real bitter or leather tastes at all. Alocohol is well hidden.;;;;;;;;;;
Paid $1.50 for a 20 oz. bottle. Nice smoky black color, shallower parts are a very deep red-brown. Smells amazing, chocolately and burnt sugary molasses. Tastes equally awesome. Much more flavor than the usual bock. Caramel and heavy toasty malts. This may be the session beer of all session beers. Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle, bottled Dec 2009. Pours a very dark brown/black with a one-finger brown head. Holds a light cap with a little bit of spotty lacing. 		Aroma is gourmet coffee beans, chocolate and dark roasted malts. 		Flavor is very chocolaty, big time coffee, especially in the finish, along with a touch of acidity. 		Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy thanks to the oats, a little thin compared to the competition, with low to medium carbonation. 		A very, very nice coffee stout, gets a slight bump due to being the best bargain in the category. There are a few that are better, but cost twice as much or more. Founders Breakfast Stout is one I'll keep coming back to.";;;;;;;;;;
"Had this one at Capones on tap, served out of a tulip. 		A: Poured a 1/2 finger coarse white head that dissipated quickly. Brew was a slightly cloudy yellow with an orange tint. Lacing was stringy and spotty but scattered. 		S: Citrus, candied cherries, grass, hops, cane sugar, and a pleasantly surprising pineapple. 		T: Caramel and hops upfront that gradually evolve into a brown sugar maltiness. Middle is a bit boozy with a hint of cherry. A bit of brown sugar lends a nice smooth end to this one. What ruins it here is that this just keeps getting boozier and hoppier as it warms...		M: Medium bodied and coarse. Ends a bit dry but very very smooth with a lasting brown sugar finish. 		D: Likeable... the only way I can really describe this one is that its an unique IIPA. I'd have it again, but drink quickly, this doesn't get any better than when its served a bit cold.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours with little head retention but colour is a nice pale gold.		Smells quite pungent and grainy with some yeasty aromas present too.		The strong aromas are continued in the taste which is also backed up with some quite bitter hop flavours.		Pleasantly surprised at the strength of flavour contained in this beer and whilst maybe not of the calibre of some of its German/Czech counterparts, a worthy attempt at the style.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a cloudy, yet sunshiney yellow amber hue. Very hazey, but exploding with carbonation. Very thick foam of hea and sticky lacing. Just awesome. The aroma is exploding with a sunshines burst of fresh hops that hnt at pine and a flowerfield right nxt to a grapefruit grove. The taste starts of quickly with some rye like mals, but then swifty moves to the hops. Lots of citrusy ad grassy uv rays hitting the tongue. Complex biterness that slowly fades away. Very good APA, but better for indulgence than sessions.;;;;;;;;;;
Clear gold in appearance, very nice look, with good foam. The smell is the hoppy you want in a pale ale, invites you to taste this beer. Mouthfeel is hoppy in and on tongue, then it is gone, nice. Taste is crisp and clean with an nice balance of hops. Overall this is a fridge worthy beer. An anytime beer that will go well with any side order. We want this on tap at the local pub.;;;;;;;;;;
"Into a .25l Schlenkerla tulip it poured a crystal clear ruby-brown with ebony undertones and a dense tan long-lasting two-finger head. The reflected light in the bottom of the glass really shows off this beer's color beautifully.		Aroma is amazing- very straightforward and taughtly composed at first glance yet underneath is a sumptuous complexity. The smoke hits you first and it is definitely omnipresent but that soon gives way to spicy elements (black pepper, nutmeg), creamy malt, dark caramel, figs, sawdust, cheese and stone ground mustard. It's much better than that makes it sound. Actually- this aroma is so wonderfully evocative of either an outdoor campfire or an indoor fireplace, surrounded by loved ones sharing a bountiful hearty meal.		Take the palate of the perfect bock beer- residual maltiness, alcohol, bitterness, and toasted malt all in perfect harmony- and add that evocative smokiness and spiciness to add up to this experience. It is almost too good to be true. The finish is long lasting smoke and malt.		I could drink a ton of these.";;;;;;;;;;
BE CAREFUL POURING THIS BEER! This beer should be poured slowly, due to the fact that it gives a giant head. Purchased a single bottle for a reasonable price. Defiently worth the cost to try for anyone who enjoys a red ale. Similar in taste to most reds on the market. However the hint of Rye when drinking defiently puts it on the top of the red ales on the market.;;;;;;;;;;
"poured into a glass from bottle.		the beer comes out with a good looking tan two finger head. deep brown, close to black.		sweet rich chocolatey aroma, malty and with just the tiniest hint of whisky scents. mildly bitter aroma. but very full and oaky. good stuff.		burnt nutty flavor is the first part. this slides into a creamy, vanilla and mocha flavor. the slightest bourbon flavor is there at the aftertaste, along with hints of nutmeg. this is a very good stout flavor. impressive.		creamy, low carbonation feel. filling and a bit sticky.		I love this beer. I find stouts to be so overly strong sometimes. this is a mellow and delicious beer that packs flavor without socking you in the face.";;;;;;;;;;
"Reviewed 8-22 & re-reviewed 8-27 on tap at Founders Brew pub - taken from notes		A - Copper and transparent with a tiny white head. Had Curmudgeon about a year ago and I thought it was a darker color than this version...could be wrong as I didn't review that beer.		S - Sweet maple and bourbon, some oak and vanilla. Had this and my wife had the Apple Bourbon Cream Ale. This had so much more oak than the Cream Ale but the maple really comes through.		T - An explosion of sweet maple bourbon and caramel flavor. No alcohol here as the sweetness hides the burn well. If you like sweet/bourbon/caramel this is a must try.		M - Beautiful low carb, sticky sweet and creamy.		D - Again this hides the alcohol and the sweetness really keeps you coming back though I'd be careful...11% will catch up to you.		Overall this was the beer of my MI trip. I had it on day one and we took a detour to try it again. I love bourbon and sweet maple so this was a homerun!";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance - dark, rich brown, like baker's chocolate. Creamy, off white head. 		Smell - alot of dark chocolate and coffee. 		Taste - Alot of dark roast malt. Molasses, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of tobacco. A tiny bit of alcohol warmth in the finish. Very pleasant		Mouthfeel - Not as creamy as it looks, would be amazing on Nitro. Very delightful, yet too effervescent for the style.		Overall - This is always on the list of the most popular and best porters, and its obvious why. Great beer, a flagship of the style.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a honey golden with a thick creamy off white head... Lots of active carbonation and good lacing as well... This just looks like a good IPA...		Very strong and pungent aromas of citrusy grapefruit hops all the way here... Very very citrusy aromas here, very West Coast as others have said... This smells ridiculously delicious...		Juicy citrusy hops explode across the palate right off the bat and finish with a lingering grapefruit finish that has me ready for each successive sip... Very delicious IPA here... Its juicy as hell, grapefruit, pineapple, orange... All mixed in together... Really nice...		Overall, a truly classic IPA and one that I will be buying regularly from now on.. Its solid as hell and delicious....";;;;;;;;;;
"I bought a sampler of Kirkland Signature Beers at Costco, 4 beers 6 bottles of each. Poured in to a pint glass.		Pours a clear copper/amber color, with a lot of bubbles rising in the glass. Creamy off-white head, laces the glass with sticky white rings.		smell is faint, a bit of a sweet bread aroma perhaps.		Taste is quite good. A caramel nut flavor up front, with a sweet bread taste, and a mildly bitter finish. It's not overly sweet like I find a lot of amber ales to be. 		Mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly clean. There is a very effervescent feel on the tongue. Seems to be a lot of carbonation for the style.		A very drinkable amber. I like it a lot more than some of the sweeter flatter amber ales I have had. And at the $18 a case price point, this one is hard to beat.";;;;;;;;;;
"Review reflects both on-tap and bottle versions, which I feel are identical. 		A: Pours a hazy brownish red with a one finger head that dissipates into a cap that lasts the entire beer. Laces very nicely. There are some nice-looking golden highlights in this beer, though head retention could be a tad better for the style.		S: Hops, some sweetness, and very little, if any, rye is noticeable. There is a nice tropical citrus-like hop fruitiness to this one. Very DIPA like in the aroma, the bottle says 70IBUs, so I can see why. With aromatic hops this powerful, it's hard to get past them and look for other complexities. Very aromatic.		T: Hop bomb. This tastes like a very well done DIPA, especially at 70 IBU (approx. the same as HopSlam). This one is reasonably balanced with citrus + tropical fruit like hops that dominate the flavor profile. Bitterness is perfectly dynamic and allows easy drinking. The finish is quick and clean, there is very little linger bitterness. A tinge of malt comes through on the finish at times. 	Perfect for a DIPA, but for a Rye beer, I have to admit that I can't taste any Rye. Still looking... nope, no rye at all here, but I do not care. Founder's has created a beautiful variation of the DIPA with dynamic bitterness and a refreshing hop profile.		M: Medium bodied, perfectly carbonated, and sort of creamy. Doesn't have the thin or syrupy feel of some D/IPAs. 		D: I can drink a giant mug of this, oh wait, I have. As drinkable as hop bombs can get.		O: My favorite hop bomb, pick this one up if you like em'.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into my pint glass the beer is hazt apple cider golden orange. Even with a quiet pour the light beige head towers over five fingers. Thick sticky lace everywhere.		The aroma is no surprise, rye. Lots of citrus and pine. A solid bready sweetness comes in as well. Like a loaf of rye bread dipped in hops.		The flavor is full on rye bread mixed with toffee and caramel. Lots of citrus but not bitter at all. It almost has a porter quality to it. 		Medium to full body with surprisingly mild carbonation. Dry finish.		Overall a splendid beer. Has this many times on tap and always loved it. This is my first bottle but certainly not my last.";;;;;;;;;;
Amazing legs on this beer - clung to the glass like fine liquor. A touch syrupy, with gigantic roasted malt, redolent of coffee and bitter chocolate. Alchol is warming, leaning a bit toward hot. A very big RIS, and it might benefit from just a little age.;;;;;;;;;;
Beautiful dark copper color.  Taste reminds me of being in the woods.  Kind of a piney flavor.  Complex, lots of flavor.  Starts sweet, mellows, hints of citrus.  Nice full body, medium smooth on the tongue.  Finishes dry.  Easy to drink.;;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance - Pours deep amber-red, with about 1 finger of head. Excellent clarity. Head falls fairly quickly, with moderate lacing.		Aroma - Toasty malt and citrusy hops. Spiciness from the rye.		Flavor - Big citrusy American hop flavor. Good malt support without dominating the flavor. Dry finish.		Mouthfeel - Moderate carbonation, slight astringency from high hop levels and rye.		Overall - Very enjoyable IPA. The rye isn't predominant, but adds some complexity to the flavor and aroma.";;;;;;;;;;
"Semi-transparent yellow orange brew. Frothy white head forms and leaves a thin film on top with silky lacing.		Citrus aromas, lots of hops. Touch of pine and honey in the nose.		Bold hops dominate the flavor to start it off. Very citrusy with lemon, orange and grapefruit notes. Malt is sweet and honey-like. The alcohol warms the throat and the hops dry the tongue letting you know you're drinking a real beer. Finish is surprisingly clean and the drying effect is short-lived.		Medium to full-bodied, a bit lighter than I expected and this adds to the drinkability. Low amount of fizz but enough to tickle the senses. Texture is creamy at the end.		First DIPA I've tried and I am definitely impressed. A very well rounded beer. Flavors are robust yet balanced. Feel is dry then clean and crisp at the end. Alcohol is barely detectable in the taste, making it somewhat deceptive and even dangerous. My gut tells me this has been aged because the hops seem a bit restrained and the finish just a tad too smooth. Maybe I'm wrong and the beer is just that good. Another exceptional brew from Founders.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Pours a dark orange with very little head and some slight lacing		S - Lots of hops; Grapefruit and citrus with a little boozy smell		T - Lots and lots of hops. Similar to smell profile, but a good malty backbone with lots of caramel to back up the hops. Slight warmth from the alcohol towards the end that fades into a bitter aftertaste		M - Highly carbonated and fairly light for such a boozy beer.		D - This will ruin your palate for pretty much anything afterwards, but it's a good beer that I'll be having several more of.";;;;;;;;;;
This beer is really nice. I have been sitting on it for around a month after I picked it up from Redstone liquiors.;;This is a great brew here is the review.;;A - Dark Chocolate small wispy head looks nice.;;S - Beautiful a chocolate liquirace smell almost sweet.;;T - a A nice treat provides a bittersweet choco otmeal taste that is sweet and nice.;;M - Nice bitter feel expected but nice.
"From a bottle into a tulip		A: Like midnight, with a dense cappuccino like foam that sticks around a while.		S: Overwhelming coffee, some dark malts, and a bit of milk chocolate hiding in the back somewhere.		T: Huge flavours going on here. Beautiful sunday morning strong coffee, triple chocolate brownies, and a nice bitterness to balance it all out.		M: Nicely carbonated and smooth on the tongue.		D: Infinite";;;;;;;;;;
"Thin white head atop a golden beer with little floaty bits in it.		The smell is a strong malty sweetness that enhances the gigantic floral noble hops. There is an almost winey quality to the nose (and I would love to see what would happen if they amped this up to about 12 percent).		Taste is has a forward bitterness to stand up to the latent sweetness in this beer + the sweetness is very much in harmony with the strength of this beer. This beer certainly has the bitterness and complexity & balance to approximate a strong version of Budweiser Budvar (Czechvar). Due to strength it's a bit more bready, and perhaps was fermented at a slightly warmer temperature because it is very fruity, but the fruitiness is not out of line with that that could have been achieved with generous late hop additions and not readily apparent as anything other than the natural apple esters you might get from a cold lager fermentation.		This is my first time trying it and I'll be getting more at my earliest convenience. I've never been disappointed in any Lithuanian beer that has made the journey to the U.S. - A truly great beer in my arrogant opinion.		And a note to all of you with a glass full who can't properly review a beer... Drink less, drink better, think more... please.";;;;;;;;;;
"given the track record with the other beers from the cooler that this one came from, i would guess that this bottle is at least a year old.		pours deep black with a light tan head. leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass. 		smells of coffee, chocolate, and alcohol sweetness.		this beer is pretty light for an imperial stout. a little bit of dark chocolate bitterness balances out the sweetness of the alcohol and malts.		Even thoughStoudt's is one of the two brewerys i've toured (Erie being the other) it fell off of my radar for a while, especially since they stopped bottling the Abbey Triple in 750s. Id drink the occasionaly Scarlet Lady ESB, but this beer might make me give all of their beers another look.		good beer.";;;;;;;;;;
(Served in a pint glass);;A- This beer pours a deep copper body with an antique white head the is creamy and last for a good bit. There is a gentle carbonation gliding to the surface. ;;S- The juicy citrus hops come through with pine notes to follow and an orange hard candy hop aroma that finishes.;;T- The green citrus hop flavor has some woody green notes to follow. There is a pale malt note with some light toasted malt hint underneath. As the beer opens up there is a soft caramel sweetness that fades to a woody bitterness of hops that lingers for a bit. ;;M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with a soft alcohol warmth in the finish. ;;O- This is a solid tasty IPA with some good depth and hops character and nice support from the malt. It is a bit high in alcohol to have more than one as it goes down pretty smooth.
"YES! A non-infected bottle! My first Sue a couple of weeks ago whats SOUR. This is a re-review of a good bottle.		A - Black. Not Sludge-like, but black all the same. Head is a light brown, nice lacing, and excellent retention. 		S - Tons of smoke and a nice woody character. Bit of sweetness and roasted malts.		T - Starts out a bit woody, with some bitterness up front. The smoke is tamed a bit more and much more appropriate. It moves to a lot of roasted and sweet malts, chocolate, and a nice coffee finish. There's some leathery tastes at the end.		M - The feel is solid medium in body, very creamy, low carbonation, and coating.		D - Good drinkability. Very yummy, and a couple would be great in a setting.";;;;;;;;;;
"a - poured a one finger thick dark coffee-colored head into a goblet. poured thick and block like motor oil. left a nice ring and lace throughout.	s - coffee and oatmeal.	t - coffee, oatmeal and dry chocolate.	m - thick and coating with a slight bubbly feel yet was really clean.	d - unbelievably good. top notch beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"For a mild, this is very original indeed. Emerges a dark ruby colour with a big tan head, and almost looks like a porter or a stout.		The aromas were ambiguous but malty, and roasted.		The taste was very peculiar - roasted hops and malts combined with a mature, almost cheese sort of bite and a chestnut undertone. Finish is surprisingly strong and unique.		Nice mouthfeel, perhaps a little gassy, but otherwise very drinkable too.";;;;;;;;;;
A black opaque color, with a small coffee colored head forming. Chocolate and coffee aromas come right out, but there is the slight fragrance of alchol at the end of each scent. The taste starts with a dried fruit flavor, mostly of currants, followed by the chocolate and coffee present in the scent. A small bit of bitterness comes in right at the end. Thick and rich in the mouth, with an oily texture, a warming feel of alchol does linger on the palate. A strong imperial stout, excellent flavor, and good aroma. All need to do is sit back and sip, and enjoy this beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Bright shining gold with an initial pillowy white head, which soon dissipates.		Smell: Beautiful grassy smell, with some hop floralness.		Taste: Two things happen in parallel: on one track is a soft, soft maltiness that is juicy and sweet yet (hopefully not oxymoronically) dry. On the other track is a beautiful hop bitterness - slaty at times - that announces itself and then lingers long after the liquid is gone. Just an excellent balance between both aspects.		Mouthfeel: Very nice level of carbonation. Not overly prickly, yet not flat either.		Drinkability: This could be the king of pilseners, and certainly something that I will reach for in the summer. Slightly better than Staropramen - better bitterness IMHO - and better than Urquel in the bottle. Very nice.";;;;;;;;;;
The color of this beer was very striking to me. It appears to have an almost lime green coloration to it. Cloudy appearance and extremely still. No signs of movement. The nose is nicely balanced with some grains, malts and perhaps a whiff of hops. The attack is smooth and easy and the mouthfeel comes across as smooth and not quite creamy. The flavor has a fruity quality to it. As it approaches and enters its finish there is a growing bitterness. Enjoyable for sure.;;;;;;;;;;
"A: Pours an apple juice gold with a gigantic white foamy head. Head lingers and laces nicely. Great looking beer.		S: Smells real hoppy with citrus fruit and an earthy rose like smell. Pines and malt present as well. It's like laying in a meadow on a warm spring day. Smells real clean and crisp.		T: You get some of the taste that you smell in regards to the earthy tones, rose, and citrus. Fairly watery for the smell, this was suprising. Aftertaste is somewhat fruity and dry.		M: Watery, crisp, and light bodied.		D: The appearance and smell of this beer are amazing. The taste and mouthfeel are lacking. I would choose Founders Centenial IPA over their Pale Ale.";;;;;;;;;;
"10 oz serving delivered in a snifter on tap.		a/s Has a fantastic looking half inch slightly tan foamy head, tons of lacing and an amazing smell, like a burnt fruit. It has a dark dark dark brown body.		T An amazing tasting beer, rich in malts and fruit, the initial taste was heavy hitting but very smooth. It starts off like a nice stout with a strong kick and some ever so slightly sour wooden earthy tones. This taste fades away to something resembling a sweet cherry flavored wine. It is very hard to describe the layers upon layers of taste this brew produces.		M/D If I where inclined to do so, I could drink this beer like water. Its smooth on the tongue and if no one told you, you would have no clue that this beer was 12% ABV.		In short, an amazing beer that I would gladly pay $8 a 10oz glass for again and again. Dont pass up a chance to try it if you should wander across it.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle with Julian date inkjetted on the neck.		We get not one, but TWO hemp-infused beers from O'Fallon? This one and Hemp Hop Rye?!? Alrighty then.. 		Muddy, dark brown. It's got a murky, milkshake-like quality to it. A tan head bubbles up, then down to a ring. Laces the glass. Smells very nice, very much on the sweet, chocolate side of malts. Some tang upfront, and then a jolt of the hemp, in sort of a bitter & oily sense, then brought back down by dark cacao flavor. Resolvedly tannic aftertaste. Darn tasty brew here. O'Fallon rocks the hemp brews like no other!";;;;;;;;;;
"From 12oz bottle to Bruges hybrid glass on 10/14/11	*From notes		Bottle Date: 10/6/11		A: An oil spill in a glass. Dark and brooding - a generous pour yields a dense two finger head. The rentention is impressive, as are the gobs of lacing rimming the glass.		S: Freshly brewed black coffee and melted dark cocoa.		T: Jesus is this fresh: the coffee wrecks immediate havoc on my poor palate. It's like the best damn diner coffee you've ever had, but in beer form. Unsweetened dark chocolate slams across the mid, and the two parts equal an epic whole, as they wash over the finish, hand in hand. This is absolutely fantastic.		M: Liquid chocolate. It coats my mouth, my throat and I'm sure my tummy too.		O: I really can't believe it took me this long to review Founders Breakfast Stout. I've bought cases of this stuff and never once laid down a review? Fail, Rhettroactive.		It goes without saying that this is one of my favorite, easily accessible beers. And having had it both aged and now insanely fresh, I absolutely believe this needs to be consumed ASAP to be enjoyed to it's fullest. Seek this out kiddies, as it'd be a sin not to.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle poured into a chalice, 2010 vintage		A- dirty hazy brown with sediment suspended evenly throughout glass. No head to speak of, just a thin ring of foam.		S- nice bourbon nose with strong vanilla and oak noticeable. It's like they're making the bourbon right in your glass. Brown sugar and molasses become more evident as it warms. 		T-Nice bourbon flavor dominates the beer, slight warming in the back of the mouth. The mashed grain taste continues to be ever present. 		M-Carbonation is light but noticeable, medium bodied, but for the punch this beer packs it seems just a little light.		O- This is a nice brew, not as stunning as I remembered it, but nevertheless it's a beer to take your time with and appreciate.";;;;;;;;;;
"Many thanks to my friend Matt for sending this along.	Pours a wonderful orange amber with almost no head, but the little collar of foam leaves wonderful lacing on my DFH signature glass. Interestingly, there were a lot of chunks in suspension when I poured, even though I was careful and tried to save sediment at the bottom. I will take this as an anomaly and won't count it against Nemesis. The aroma is very sweet and boozy with a pronounced bourbon aroma as well as some vanilla. The maple seems to be well incorporated, and I can't say that I can totally pick it up, but I believe it is adding a little somthin' somthin' to the bouquet. The flavor has a wonderful maple (there you are!) and vanilla character to it that really is what makes this beer special. Bourbon is there as well, but it seems to mingle with the other barrel notes more in the flavor than the aroma. It also has tons of malt sweetness and is super boozy. Some wheat tang detectable, or could that be a rumor of hops? Whichever it is, it adds a nice dimension. Overall this seems to be a beer made to showcase the barrel aging process, and kudos to Founder's for not making it too busy. Mouthfeel is quite nice. Not too heavy and very smooth. Slightly sticky, but not too much so for style. Definitely a sipper, but I would say it is quite drinkable for the style.";;;;;;;;;;
"Dark red body with a off white head.Citrus,""spray starch"" smell to it and some pineapple.Grapefruit taste then some nice malts.Bittering hops are there as well.Creamy mouthful,good beer and a great hoppy beer.I dont know where the ""spray starch"" smell and taste comes from but it sorda distracts from the overall taste and smell of the beer.You should try it.";;;;;;;;;;
"Rounding out my sampling of Hoppin' Frog until someone can send me a Barrel Aged B.O.R.I.S. Poured from a 22 ounce bottle without a date into a Stone Arrogant Bastard 0.5L glass.		Beer is reddish and hazy. Forms a thin head of off white / yellow head made up of small bubbles. Carbonation is moderate and made up of small bubbles that rise through the beer slowly. Head leaves a lot of lacing as the beer is drank.		Aroma is dominated by pine hop character.		Full bodied beer, lots of malt character in the front, no aftertaste. There is nice hop character in the midpalate region as well as a strong bitterness at the back. Overall, well connected and balanced flavors. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is good. Its a fine double IPA but not in the western / California tradition necessarily. Not a hop bomb.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle poured into imperial pint glass. Bottled 8/27/2011.		A- Brown with some red hints around the edges. Fairly dark, almost like a darker cola.		S- Dark bread, cocoa, some light notes from the maize (wouldn't have picked that out not knowing they were there.)		T- Right on with the smell. Dark bread, cocoa, a bit of bitterness.		M- Lightish, but not too much. Well carbonated. I think of this as a session beer, and it is very easy to drink.		O- A nice Yazoo offering, and one of their staples. Nice out of the bottle, but better on tap.";;;;;;;;;;
"Leather soaked in cherry juice. The sandstone colored cap fills half the glass after the initial pour and has an appealing, tight-bubbed texture. Even though surface bubbles pop at a rapid rate, they're so numerous that deflation occurs very slooowly. I like the thick, yet still delicate, sheets of lace as well.		The best that I can say for the nose is that it's classic for the style. That's far from saying that I love it. Each sniff brings plenty of well-toasted grain, maybe even edging into lightly roasted. Musky Euro hops complete the profile. I don't know that I'll ever find a EDL that's an olfactory standout.		Palone is a good version, one of the best I've had, without being great beer. Like the nose, the flavor is simply a darker version of a pretty decent Euro pale lager. I'll go with toasted brown bread, caramel, tobacco, cocoa and indeterminate spices.		For some reason, I feel like granting style a great deal of weight when it comes to assigning a taste score. In isolation, it would be a strong 3.5 rather than a weak 4.0. A good mix of sweet and bitter (I wouldn't want the beer to be either more or less of either one) tells me that hops have not been forgotten.		The mouthfeel is light-medium, as it should be, but tends to wander toward thin on the finish. It's reasonably smooth, though, and I have no complaints about the amount of carbonation or the way the bubbles feel.		Palone is nowhere near the excellence of Okocim Porter, but then I didn't expect it to be. It's probably my second favorite Euro dark lager behind Podkovan Dark, a Czechoslovakian beer that defines the style as far as I'm concerned. I love the bottles and the labels that Browar Okocim has chosen. Thankfully, the beer ain't too shabby either.";;;;;;;;;;
"pours a cloudy golden ruby hue with a thick, light tan meringue-like head has amazing retention and leaves stunning cloud-like lacing. 		aroma is surprisingly fruity. orange, grapefruit, candied hops. sugary. light malts, a touch of vanilla. peat. and more hops. Really fruity hop-forward.		Taste, not surprisingly, follows the aroma in it's fruit-forward, hoppy profile. lemon, grapefruit and orange. Strong bitterness overpowers most of the flavors except for the lingering sweetness. Seems somewhat unbalanced... maybe needs a bit of time? maybe a bit young?		Mouth is really creamy yet a bit thin for the style. a clean dryness finishes nicely leaving a lingering bitterness. I'm wanting a bit more thickness to help the flavors along.		All in all, this is one interesting beast. Somewhere between an old ale and a strong IPA. Way hoppier without the intense malt backbone I've come to know and love from old ales. Not quite strong enough to be a sipper, but a bit intense for anything less. An interesting beast... hopefully with the hops mellowing a bit over time, this may turn into something beautiful. it seems like all the elements are already there.";;;;;;;;;;
Thanks Dim for another great Penn brew.;Bottle poured into a pint glass produced a two finger head that stuck around for a while. the body was a wonderful clear red in color ;;There is a great hop nose on this brew with a touch of sweetness from the malts. The flavor profile is hop forward with the bitter citrus upfront with a dry finish. It feels about medium in my mouth with good carbonation.;;The brew is a easy to drink and much better than last years. Thanks again Dan. Stouts can make this one again in my book;;;;;
"Brought back from the great state of Wisconsin as a single bottle...now I wish I had another. 		Pours with almost no head & an off-orange color. Smell is awesome. The taste - hops, hops, hops, but the bitterness is well-masked & not nearly as aggressive as some of my favorites like Hopslam or Furious. The smell is much less subtle, the taste seems a little less 'extreme'. 		M&A is good. The alcohol is present when it starts to warm up my tummy, not so much on the tongue. Very smooth. I could see bottles of this disappearing in one sitting without noticing much. 		Really, really good IPA. Also my first Founders brew, which has left an excellent impression & an unfulfilled yearning for more. Oh, why did I only buy a single? Why, gods, why!";;;;;;;;;;
"A: dark, dark black with an incrediblly brown/tan head. It doesn't last long, but a nice swirl of the glass agitates it up nicely.		S: Dark fruits, molasses, booze		T: Some dark fruits, some subtle tropical flavors, roasted barley, and lots of booze. Excellent.		M: Very smooth, creamy, viscous and oily. Coats the throat with ease. Very nice.		O: Very nice. Despite the high alcohol, this drinks very easily and feels great going down. Excellent!";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a dark coffee brown with caramel highlights and nice lacing from the head. On the nose, some nice malty chocolate notes and bitter roasted malts. Typical aromas but well done. The palate follows the nose, with some nice bitterness from the malts throughout and a tinge of initial acidity that I assume is from the hops. Nice mouthfeel, perfect weight and carbonation. This is just a really solid porter, true to style and very sessionable.;;;;;;;;;;
12/02/06 Walk the Line Barleywine Festival, Dunedin, FL. 1998 vintage. Poured a clear copper color with an off white head. The aroma was sweet and a bit fruity. Smells like a Barleywine. This beer has a nice Barleywine flavor too with a dark fruitiness, caramel malts and a hint of pine hops. The flavor seems to end with a bit of a woody character.;;;;;;;;;;
"appearance: pitch black with some good head rentention and lacing		smell: roasted malt and chocolate, and deep rich bitter coffee		taste: horrible cold. really developed as it warmed. very complex and perfectly balanced. coffee is the dominate flavor. If anything the bitterness may take over, but still good. maybe a little smoke, burnt coffee there.		mouthfeel: full bodied beauty 		drinkability: not as good as KBS. but damn good. founders is a BA dream";;;;;;;;;;
"Ironically us folk in Michigan have a harder time getting this beer, once it's out, than do most of the other states that Founders distributes to. Therefore...		Thanks to LauraAlberts for this bottle, acquired via trade. 		A: Very dark and completely opaque, a one-finger mocha head that dissipated in a few minutes. 		S: A thick malty and coffee aroma that welcomes the bourbon aspects very easily and naturally. Clearly balanced.		T: Tastes like espresso, black malts, maybe some dark sugar, and bourbon of course. The bourbon is completely contained within the other flavors, this is a very nice balance akin to the aroma.		M: Low but dainty carbonation; it is just enough to keep the beer from being cloying or too slick. Very coating, definitely a sipper.		D: Well, just because you could drink two or three doesn't mean you will. This beer is meant to be enjoyed slowly and, in my opinion, occasionally. You wouldn't want to spoil the majesty by just throwing a few back. 		A fantastic beer by Founders. I'm definitely saving a few for aging.		Edit: I've recently had this beer both on tap and on nitro-tap. Tap is the way to go, nitro-tap is least preferable actually. The alcohol really came out in a bad way for whatever reason on the nitro tap";;;;;;;;;;
12oz can courtesy of Unclejedi, thanks! nice orange color with a foamy, sticky white head. Smells hoppy, resin, catty, nice. The taste is nicely balanced with the hops not really taking over just blending in to the picture. The mouthfeel is very smooth. Another example of good beer in a can.;;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle poured into snifter. Thanks StayWhatYouAre2 for sending a bottle of this out of the blue. 		A: Pours a nicely viscous, black liquid that (of course) resembles motor oil. A fairly violent pour yields almost no head at all, but just a thin patch film and sticky ring. It settles very still; almost no evidence of any carbonation.		S: The smell is quite complex, with dark chocolate, bourbon, toffee, roasted barley, and alcohol being the most noticeable characteristics. The smell is really great, although it smells a bit hot. 	 	T: Dark chocolate, again, is right up front, along with barrel characteristics, dark fruit, and subtle toffee. The roasted malt quality is much stronger than it is in the smell. It finishes just slightly bitter from the alcohol along with subtle hoppiness and coffee. 		M: Pretty darn thick. It's viscosity is evident on the tongue and it coats the mouth well. Subdued carbonation adds to the thickness but creates a very nice creaminess. This is one of the best aspects of this beer, in my opinion 		D: My opinion of drinkability seems to differ from most, due to some qualities that I wasn't expecting. It's not that well balanced to me. The bourbon seems to compete too much with other characteristics. In addition, the alcohol isn't hidden all that well. Quite hot, and burns a bit. 		This is really pretty spectacular, but it's not something that I'd seek out. I randomly got a bottle of this from an extremely generous BA and am glad that I got a chance to try it, but there are plenty barrel-aged stouts that I'd prefer and will go out of my way to get in the future. Either way, it was mostly enjoyable.";;;;;;;;;;
On tap at Founders. A nice dark black color pour with a light brown foamy head.Aroma is nice sweet maple,brown sugar,coffee and a hint of alcohol,smoke,and grain. Flavor is huge roasted coffee molasses,vanilla and maple syrup,with a hint of smoke, a nice alcohol flavor/bite at the end,and the maple sweetness stays on your lips after the sip. Thick body,soft carbonation, a little sweet and thick to be called sessionable but wow what a good beer,you swear that you are going to taste or smell bacon next but never quite do. Very Very good.;;;;;;;;;;
"Stopped in to get a growler of this but it was about to kick so they were only doing pours of it, unfortunately.		A - Black beer, bit of tan head that stuck around for a bit and left some nice spots for a big stout. Pretty nice looking.		S - Lots of chocolate, coconut, bourbon, vanilla, barrel. Nice roast and dark fruit, really has a lot going on. I feel like the comes through a little too strong and needs some tme to settle down.		T - Taste is really good, lots of chocolate, coconut, dark fruits, roast. It's pretty sweet, pushes the limits of being too sweet, but it's good. Beer drinks a little hot and boozy, needs time to cool, my biggest complaint about it. Still, very nice complexity and flavor.		M - Full bodied, lower carbonation, almost chewey.		O - Really nice beer, if this is the beginning of their barrel aging I'd say Haymarket has a ton of potential to kick out some really great big beers. Would love to drink this again, particularly after it's had a bit of time to sit.";;;;;;;;;;
"750ml into a tulip. Pours a hazy honey orange. Dense head subsided fairly quickly, nice lacing.		Aroma rich in white bread yeast atop orange peel, the skin of light fruits and spices, quiet coriander. Hop aromas abound.		Tangy taste, literally, a hint of Tang. Minor hop bitterness contributes to the mildly dry lingering aftertaste, pleasant . Alcohol appears absent. Thin yet creamy mouthfeel.		The best Nols are dominated by strong darks, this is a superior take from a strong pale brew. Not the typical Nol spices but it works well !	cheers	jd";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours pitch black, no light shines through; creamy light brown head that lasts for quite a while. Smell is coffee, slight chocolate, roast malt. Taste- wow. Choco-coffee-berry, licorice and anise, pretty complicated and divine. Slightly sweet yet also dry, very good balance. Barely there carbonation, near still, definitely hovering around the 1.5 volumes of co2 for style. Very creamy and rich. This would go great with desert or as desert!";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a five-finger cream head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Cloudy amber with a ton of yeast in bottom of bottle. Slight hoppy nose. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is sweet like a creamsicle - smooth, hint of hops at finish. $3.80 for a 330ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured this one Thanksgiving Morning 2010. Nice way to start the day and get my 24 hours of gluttonous moving along..		A -Pours nice and black with a beatl espresso brown but then thin head.		S - Nice Roast, Lost of Coffee and a bit of sweetness		T - Just a bit bitter with lots of nice coffee. The coffee is balanced well with the sweetness and slight smoke. 		M - Its a bit sticky and thick but not overpowering for this style. I expect a certain amount of body for this style and this one doesn't disappoint.		D - I suppose for this style this is very drinkable but overall I don't find myself wanting more than one in a single sitting.";;;;;;;;;;
12oz bottle poured into a HotD tulip.;;Appearance - Dark brown with a slight red tint. Small thin tan head that lingers. Good Lacing.;;Smell - Brown sugar and fruit.;;Taste - Carmel - Strong brown sugar.;;Drinkability - Low carbonation.;;Overall - Smooth and delicious.
"On nitro-tap at the brewery. 		A - Dark black with one finger of creamy light brown head with good retention. 		S - Roasted malts, a nice sweetness, some coffee.		T - Sweet roasted malts. Some coffee. Some bittermess in the finish.		M - Creamy. Light carbonation. 		D - A superb stout.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a dark opaque coffee color with a thick dark beige head. Aroma is a mix of roasted malts heavy on cocoa/bittersweet chocolate. Taste was the same as the aroma, although there was a little kick to it. The beer was really thick, reminded me of an expedition stout from Bells when pouring. However, the carbonation was pretty weak, so it felt like i was drinking a thin syrup rather than a beer. However, given it's taste and price, a great drinkable beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Pours out a bright straw-colored yellow that's just a touch hazy. The frothy white head formed atop the beer like heavily whipped egg whites. 		Smell: The lemony, floral hop aroma is a knockout. A bit of graininess in the nose as well.		Taste: Oo! An abrupt, snap of puckering lemon greets the tongue. Grainy, with some lightly sweet malts in the mix. Finish is customarily dry with a lingering spiciness. All the flavors mesh well.		Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Clean and Crisp. The two c's that please.		Drinkability: Yes, I enjoyed it. At work, even! A tasty pilsner from Stoudt's.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Very merky orange and yellow color. Small white head. Lots of bubbles. Nice lacing.		S: Spicy pine, minor booze smell. I do get a little bread behind the northwest hops.		T: Nicely balanced. Great malt back bone that really supports the hops. They are prominent, however, they don't leave the malt in the dust. This is a great representation of the style.		M: Light bodied, minus the higher carbonation. Flavor goes quickly but the hops stick around nicely. Not thick or oily.		D: Could be a nice session beer. Again, with the balance, this is a good representation of an american IPA.";;;;;;;;;;
Unquestionably, the best aspect of this beer was its beautiful, deep, dark pink color. It arrived with no head, but instead, just a white ring around the edge of the glass. The nose was unmistakably of raspberry. The mouthfeel was light to medium with lots of raspberry flavor in the mouth. The finish was dry, but not intensely so. Jonathan let me try some of his Blushing Monk to compare, but the tart dryness was too much.;;;;;;;;;;
From a bottle, pours a clear dark burgundy with a nice head. Nose is smoked meat tending toward ham, salt pork, not so much bacon in this case. Salty and light, pleasant. Mouth is soft, smoked ham, very light somehow, airy. I picture cubed hunks of artisan ham here. Yep, artisan ham. Fluffy with an appropriate bittering hop near the finish. Dry. Nice stuff.;;;;;;;;;;
Pours up clear yellow with a thick head. Some malt in the aroma, but not too much else. Starts off clean, with slightly sweet malt flavors. Finishes with tingle of hops on the tongue. After three glasses, it's a little too bitter. It's still good, though.;;;;;;;;;;
"A- Hazy with a thick foamy head. Lots of lacing. Very common appearance with this type of beer.		S- Sweet smell of grapefruit. 		T- This is sweet tasting, lots of citrus mostly grapefruit with a pithy bitterness. I'm getting a good malt profile, but the hops are there. The more you drink this the more bitter this becomes.		M- Thick syrupy in feel. The bitterness attacks the tongue like ants on a sugar cube. 		D- Easy to drink for sure.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz undated bottle poured into a pint glass. Great label!		A- Double Trouble pours a hazy golden amber color with a white head of foam that quickly settles to a top coat and ring, and leaves some good lacing on the sides. Rather light colored for style. Significant amount of sediment in bottle was added, for better or worse, about 3 sips in. 		S- nice aroma featuring piney and floral hops with an underlying sweet caramel scent. Slightly earthy. High ABV apparent. 		T- Good grapefruit, orange and pine flavored hops with an underlying caramel malt backbone. Rather earthy mid-palate onwards. 		M- smooth; medium body; low/moderate carbonation. 		O - Double Trouble is a respectable DIPA worth trying. I'd probably like this better with a lower ABV.";;;;;;;;;;
"Finally had one of these on tap last night. Tried it before from a bottle, but it was skunked to high-heaven. (big surprise) 		Poured with a finger of head. Healthy golden color. Aroma is just a kiss of hoppiness.			Taste - Oh, this is what a ""light"" beer is supposed to be. Nothing earth shattering, just lightly hoppy and delicious. This is the first time I've tasted saaz hops and simply enjoyed it instead of wishing it was cascade, chinook, or centennial instead. I would keep this in my fridge on a regular basis if I could buy it in good condition. Perfectly drinkable.			So it's brewed with 70something percent hop extract now? Oh, well. I guess that doesn't necessarily mean bad beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Perhaps not one of the prettiest Weissbiers I have seen, but certainly one of the tastiest. Nose of spice, smoke and tobacco. Medium body holds a zippy wheat flavor enhanced by phenols and, of course, smoked malt. The smoke flavor lingers a good long time beckoning you to taste again and assure yourself that you are truly tasting what you think you are. Conjures up all the good smoky experiences I've ever had. Good stuff!		Cheers to VENOM for the sample!";;;;;;;;;;
"Served in a Pilsner glass from a bottle at 37F about 5 weeks before the freshness date.		The foam is perfect as is the amber clear color; perfectly bright. Perfect lace leaving a marker of each sip. On appearance, it would be no surprise you're about the quaff the stuff of legends.		The smell is the definition of the pilsner style. Grassy, grainy smell that gives a hint of the taste...		...which is a bit cardboardy in mine. There's the sort of pancake flavor and hay, with the light malt and hops balancing each other out.		The mouthfeel is light and vaguely astringent.		Yes, this is a different beer than I remember and it's easy to bash it for having become a macrobrew and having, you know, clean equipment (the horror!) but I think this beer is of high quality and suffers from comparison to its self of old.";;;;;;;;;;
"Crimson coloration, cloudy, with a light layer of whitish foam...aroma? fruit, hops, bright, sunny, citric, very arousing, uplifting...very nice.	Taste: good, hoppy, fruity, full-bodied, and very flavorful. Rich andwell-rounded, tasty...have I said ""yum"" yet? sweet fruitiness, peaches, apricot, melon, more...a bit forbidding, at 7%, but the sweet flavor wins over any anxiety. this is flat-out delicious! rings around the mouth nicely. 	Another bottle of Scotch-built goodness. Very good. Yum, yum, yum.";;;;;;;;;;
A staple beer for anyone living in middle Tennessee. Dos Perros is a good beer which presented with very little head. Often this beer is sered too cold as it was last night at The Palm restaurant in downtown Nashville. Order it and let it sit a little and as it warms is choclate notes are more evident and it tastes better. An area this beer could be better is mouthfeel. A little too much carbonation at times. Try it if you get a chance - one of my favorite Yazoo beers..;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a deep orange amber with a light tan head that lingers for a while. Some particulates floating around.		Bourbon is prominent in the aroma. Little vanilla, slightly sweet honey and caramel. Difficult to quantify, but enjoyable.		Upfront taste is sweet with a little caramel, bourbon, lots of vanilla and a hint of maple syrup. Finish is heavier on the bourbon. Noticeable maple syrup sweetness. Little woodiness throughout.		Medium to full bodied and syrupy with low carbonation. Some alcohol heat at the finish.		Nice balance of sweetness and bourbon. Not overly boozy but a little hot. Really good aroma and flavor--on the sweet side. A great sipper.		7/22/2011";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Duvel Belgian Tulip glass. I picked up a 6-pack for $9.99 from Canals in the Hamilton Marketplace (NJ).		Appearance: A moderately aggressive pour got me a 1/4"" beige head that reduced to a thin ring. Nice cascading lacing when I tilt my glass, but it fades quickly once brought upright. A medium brown color with a tad bit of murkiness to it. 		Smell: Sweet caramel, malts, brown sugar with a mild boozy finish. This is my first Scotch Ale so I'm not sure what to expect. So far the nose is pretty darn enticing. I also sense some dark fruit similar to an Abbey Dubbel.		Taste: Sweet caramel, along with bready malts, chocolate, and a nice warming alcohol presence. Mild bittering hops are present, but not overwhelming, in the finish. 		Mouthfeel: A creamy, buttery texture on the tongue with moderate carbonation. I know it's suppose to be a ""Wee Heavy"" but I think Founders did a very good job with making you forget it is a 8.5%'er and I would put it at a medium body style. All of the flavors blend extremely well. 		Overall: A very tasty beer but the Scotch Ale style is not my thing so I probably wouldn't seek it out again. With that said, it was a very easy drinking beer. I still want to try the Backwoods Bastard so I will revisit the style again.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appears a dark nearly black body with ruby highlights when held toward the light, deep tan head forms thick with a nice creamy texture soft carbonation forms with minimal even thin lacing with each sip. This was my favorite beer when infused with Espresso beans at last years Steel City Big Pour in the Burgh.		Aroma dark roasts bring out mild cocoa and dark roasted coffee accents but a nice creamy filled airiness is detected within each sniff. Mild metallic astringency with herbal hops finishing delicately. Almost a toasted marshmallow comes out as it warms very nice burnt caramel malts in the thick of it. 		Flavors are nice creamy dark roasted malt profile brings out layers of light coffee and milk chocolate in this one, with a running back bone of caramel malt to lighten up the roasts a bit. A very nice interpretation of a classic style slightly smokey malts to liven things up, finishes with a mild herbal hop flavor classic brew straight out of Ohio these guys are the dark beer specialists of the North. 		Mouthfeel is medium bodied slightly chewy with girth yet it still manages to slide across the palate as smooth as silk, no astringency finishes creamy sweet almost milky. Really good carbonation flow without overdoing anything a truly balanced feel to it.		Drinkability is dangerous I wish I get a whole sixer of this decent pricing for the Hoppin Frog line of beers this one should be their flagship nix their standard Hoppin' to Heaven IPA and say hello to the Silk Porter.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a hazy orange amber with a thin white head that fades fast but leaves nice rings of sea foam lace.		The smell is nice and mild with touches of banana, clove, cinnamon and nutmeg. Some citrus notes as well of orange and lemon with a nice grainy, wheat background.		The taste follows witht the grainy wheat flavor, some caramel notes, and mild green banana. Faint hints of clove, and other spice. Nutmeg notes and a hint of vanilla.		The texture is almost creamy, but grainy edged, thin and dry finished with citrus. Overall, a nicely balanced, refreshing, crisp beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - A little darker than i expected, pours golden rather than straw. minimal lacing.		S - Nose is of malt, with that clean lagery scent		T - Well balanced taste. everything is there in good proportion - a little sweetness towards the beginning that goes away rapidly, followed by malt and a hops bitterness to finish. Good representative of the the style.		M - Mouthfeel is pretty light, less carbonation than expected, but maybe that's letting the malt come out more.		D - Very drinkable, especially with spicy food. A solid pilsener.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - pours with two fingers of tan foam on top of an opaque, black body. The head settles slowly and leaves moderate lace.		S - a strongly roasty aroma with coffee and a bit of chocolate.		T - smoky coffee and some dark chocolate up front. A little bit of spice comes out in the middle with notes of chicory and licorice. Finishes with lots of coffee and moderate malt bitterness.		M - a fairly thick body, moderate carbonation, and a balanced finish.		D - nicely done, this is a bit on the thick side for a porter, but very well balanced and flavorful.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Pale gold in color with a slight haze. Pours with a smallish white head, that has little retention, but leaves decent lacing. 		S: Hoppy. Strong aroma of pine and resin. Pine foresty.		T: Low malt profile. Pine. Grapefruit. A good hop flavor with moderate bitterness and a sweet spiciness. 		M: On the lighter side of medium. With medium carbonation. A bit spicy. 		D: Very good. I liked this one a lot as this beer is all about showcasing the hop. Great hop nose and flavor with minimal malt character and moderate bitterness allows the hop to shine through, without being obnoxious. Very drinkable.";;;;;;;;;;
"I used to love this stuff... well, love is a strong word but I used to drink a lot of it. I was young and didnt know any better.	For a light beer, this is pretty good.	One downside, something I never noticed (or managed to pay attention to) when I was drinking this regularly is a soapy thing going on in the finish of the mouthfeel/flavor.	Light and watery all around but you can't expect too much for a light beer.	It's very easy to suck these down because of watery and generally inoffensive characteristics.	This has a bit more character than many other light beers out there.	Nothing worth dreaming about here, but a viable option depending upon your options.";;;;;;;;;;
"Went to Cedar Point in Sandusky, OH and made a stop at Bayshore beverage, surprised their selection was so small, but still could find something i can't find in my area.. so why not give it a shot		12oz to flare pint, pours a deep opaque black with hints of brown, creamy head fades to lacing		smells of roasty chocolate malts, coffee, heavy bourbony oak/vanilla - smells good		taste is roasty chocolate coffe, lighter weight than i expected by head / pour, sweet with a slight bitterness, bourbon stands out quite well, woody vanilla caramel, good flavors, not bad		mouthfeel is thin and of a lighter weight than i would like, all things concidered - loads of flavor, nice and drinkable, not bad!";;;;;;;;;;
"Split a bottle of this with fellow user promark420. Fittingly enough, we'll be flying to Cleveland tomorrow (catching the Falcons/Browns game).		A -- Pours dark brown with no head and not a lot of lacing on the glass.		S -- Syrupy smell with a slight hint of chocolate.		T -- It's a syrupy taste that also has hints of oatmeal and chocolate with a smoky finish.		M -- For me personally, it has the mouthfeel of a good coffee stout. A bit thick, but it works.		D -- This went down pretty easily, which is mildly alarming at 9.4 percent abv. I definitely will buy this beer again.";;;;;;;;;;
"I picked up a six pack of this last week and have just got the chance to try one tonight. I poured into a pint glass.		A- It pours a very dark black with the barest ruby hints when held to the light. It had a very small tan head that went away pretty quickly. It left faint splotchy laceing.		S- It smells great! Nice dark chocolate dominates with lots of deep roasted grains and hints of brown sugar and coffee. It also has a subtle hint of pancake syrup.		T- Sweat dark chocolate and roasted grains stand out at first with hints of caramel and molasses. Slight hint of tobacoo and syrup. It finishes with a nice slightly bitter coffee note. The alcohol has a nice warming effect that is mostley hidden. 		M- Nice thick creamy mouthfeel with farily light carbonation. It fits the style nicely!		D- All in all a very nice beer, all though a little on the sweet side. It fits its style very nicely. The alcohol warms nicely on a cold night. I will drink again. Cheers!";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a pint glass.		3.5 A: Clear orange amber color. One finger of creamy beige head with average retention and some lacing.		4.5 S: Amarillo hops through and through and what an aroma they make. Tons of flowery, citrusy orange. Subtle earthy rye spiciness. Finally, healthy portions of crystal malts.		4.0 T: Taste gives a three pronged attack. Amarillo hops are orangy and herbal, caramel sweetness from the crystal malts, and rye earthy spiciness. The flavors go together well to a certain degree, but it seems like on some sips, the rye and crystal malts clash. Anyway, this is still solid. Good amount of bitterness.		4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Reasonably creamy and smooth. Good here. Caramel and bitter aftertaste.		4.0 D: Solid beer, but something you have to be in the mood for in order to have a really enjoyable experience. That said, I might have given this a much higher score on another day, but it's hard to say for sure. Still, this is good enough anytime.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle. Appearance: Poured light amber with a thick tan head. The head had very good retention and left a good lacing. 	Smell: Aroma was a little weak in my opinion. Caramel, brown sugar and courant were the main scents. Nothing particularly interesting in the nose.	Taste: Good caramel and toffee taste with bits of courant and butterscotch in it as well. Perhaps some suggestions of chocolate in the background. 	Mouthfeel: Good malty mouthfeel with caramel and courant on the palate. There was a bitterness that was a bit strange at times. Not real bothersome though.	Drinkability: This was really easy to drink. The low ABV explains that. So easy that it went down to fast. Overall a good example of the style.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Careful pour produced 1 finger milk chocolate head. It is as black as any RIS I have ever seen. 		S: Smoked wood, vanilla, chocolate a bit of cherry. Pretty complex and as pleasant as anything I have smelled before.		T: Hoppy smokiness dominates immediately. My first smoked beer so I may be taking the smokiness for hops. It fades into a smooth chocolate where the smoke disappears into the background. I place some of the cherry in the middle and a lot in the end. 		M: Very rich and satisfying. A bit of alcohol warmth shows up after a few drinks. 		D: I personally will never be able to drink lots of beer of this style. But most people will have an easy time with this. 		I had been apprehensive about this for awhile. I don't care for Porters much. Only had 1 other Imperial Porter and it was far too sweet for me. This however has a lot of that RIS quality that I like. Most Porters are just too Meh for me. But this is very complex and not weak at all. I wish Linus Hall and the folks at Yazoo the best of luck!";;;;;;;;;;
"Enjoyed a glass of this last night at Caldera's tap house.		Pours a very dark brown color, with a thin off white head.		Aromas are of very dark semi sweet cocoa with hints of cream and coffee.		Flavors are just like the nose. Dark cocoa, semi sweet, creamy, with some brown sugar, espresso, and hints of oak. Finish is crisp, with really subtle booziness.		Mouthfeel is nice, full, smooth, and lightly carbonated.		Overall this is outstanding. This is an excellent beer that you can really taste the dark chocolate, but it still retains the flavors of a robust porter too. The balance is nice, very well done Caldera. Even my wife liked this, and she is not a fan of dark beers.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The darkest brown it can possibly be, it is basically black. There is no way to see through the glass. Very thin brown head that goes away quick.		S - The smell is nice and sweet. There is a balance between chocolate and vanilla. There is also an aroma of roasted coffee.		T - It is pretty sweet, but the chocolate is wonderful. There is some nice roasted coffee/malts in the back. I get just a touch of alcohol.		M - Nice thick feel, very creamy. Mild carbonation.		D - I love this beer and it is a great stout to drink. The ABV is pretty high, but you barely notice it. Founders is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Poured from a 33 cl bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a dark brown color with a big frothy tan head. Some light comes through with a reddish tint. Decent head retention.		Smell: Strong malty aroma with a soapy rose scent.		Taste: This beer is very earthy in character. Not very malty per se, but very spicy with several very different flavors coming through. Bark and dry grass wit ha dusty rose flovr. Also some citrus and a perfume-like orange blossom flavor. The beer is very light despite its earthy notes. It ends with a clean and light yeasty end.		Mouthfeel: Clean and refreshing on the palate. Very little aftertaste.		Drinkability: This is a very drinkable and pleasant beer. The unique flavors make it somewhat of a treat.";;;;;;;;;;
"Some houseguests came over for dinner the other night and I wasn't exactly sure what kind, if any, beer they were going to be interested in. I decided to go with a six pack of Pilsenr Urquell, just to play things safe. Turns out they loved the Smuttynose IPA I have in my kegerator right now and drank that all night long. So I have some Pilsners left over. 		Pours clean. A very clear light-amber color with frothy white head on top. The head dissipates fast, though, and leaves behind no lace. It's a decent looking beer, but nothing special. The nose is crisp and malty, like a good Czech pilsner should be. A light caramel scent and an herbal quality keep things interesting. The taste is smooth and lager-y, but with a noticeable hop kick just before it drains down the back of the throat. Nice balance. Less caramel here, but definitely more of that herbal characteristic detected in the aroma. Can't really place it, though. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, but borderline chewy... for a pilsner, that is.		This is a good beer. The Czechs know pilsners, and even though this is widely marketed all over creation now, it hasn't lost any of the qualities that made it work in the first place. I've never been a fan of the green bottle, but what can you do? Be sure to drink it fresh or on tap.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottled on date noticeable. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a nice golden color with a slight haze, nice white foamy head and nice lacing. Great aromas! Lots of funky grapefruit, pine, and resin. The flavors don't quite match the nose, but they're still great. Very sticky! There's a smooth bitterness going on.. nothing over the top. I'm picking up more grapefruit, orange, and mango. Lots of citrus blended with a touch of caramel malts. There's a nice touch of sweetness going on as well. Right amount of carbonation, very smooth. This is an extremely easy drinking IPA.		This is a great wet-hopped ale, easily one of the better ones out there. Excellent IPA from Founders, although I prefer Red's Rye PA.";;;;;;;;;;
This poured an opaque black cherry with a little tan head. It smelled like roasted coffee and dark chocolate and brown sugar, with some dry banana? Something artificial there that doesn't seem quite right. It tasted like roasted coffee with some bitter chocolate and burnt barley and brown sugar. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a nice standard porter that tasted pretty clean and nicely balanced, although somewhat boring. The scent had a strange element, but it had good body and was easy to drink. Probably not a beer I'll ever try again.;;;;;;;;;;
"Mirky,yellowy/reddish nectar-like color. 1"" very creamy white head with decent retention leaving some spotty lacing and a swirly looking coat atop the beer. Sevred from a 12oz stubby brown bottle with a twist off cap. 		Citrusy,very fruitty apricot/nectarine/peach aroma very different for an IPA had a bit of fresh dough aroma as well. Little malt aroma if any.		Taste very much like aroma very fruity peach/apricot/nectarine different from most ipa's. Tart,with a sharp tangy pleasing bitterness midway through. Nice balance leaves and fruity/citrusy taste lingering on the palate. Light feel,slightly grainy with nice tangy/tart feel.		A different ipa compaired to most,interesting,makes my want more. Becomes additive really wish i had more of it. Worth a try if you can fine it. Ordered this from Liquid Solutions. Says live beer,""live beer keep cold"" on the label shipped in the heat of the summer,wonder if it changed the taste a bit. Would love to try this beer again.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz. bottle (bottled on 5-17-10) from Pinocchio's into a snifter	Pours a copper-red with a smallish off-white head which dissaptes rapidly.	Nose is brown sugar, molasses, piney and citrus hops. Taste is citrus hops up front but lots of malt - caramel, brown sugar... then moving to a nice, dry, refreshingly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy for an IPA but not as sticky as I would have expected. Although it does get hotter as it warms (and I sip), you would not have a hint that this is 12%, so beware!";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle		appearance: hazy orange/copper, foamy white head that lingers throughout...looks tasty 		smell: very clean and floral, citrus hop explosion, tropical fruit, orange, grapefruit,underlying maltiness. very nice		taste: floral dry hops, grapefruit, tropical fruits, malty caramel underneath...not as piney as other ipa's, but plenty of citrus. delicious		mouthfeel: smooth as hell!, slightly bitter aftertaste, juicy hops		drinkability: smooth enough to drink all night		another outstanding brew from founders....american ipa is my probably my favorite style of the hour and this one did not dissapoint, worth seeking out";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Pours a clear reddish color with a small bubbly head that subsides to a frothy ring. Moderate lacing.		S: No mistakes here - this one's loaded with hops. Mostly piney and grassy aromas, but there's also some nice grapefruit aroma as well. Pleasant and complex.		T: Like the smell, a mostly vegetal hop flavor with citric notes. A big wollop of bitterness in the finish rounds out the taste. I don't really find this one to be balanced as the label describes, but then again, I can't think of too many DIPAS with 168 IBU's that are.		M: Full-bodied and heavy with light-moderate carbonation. Finishes quite dry.		D: Perhaps a bit overboard with the hops for my taste, but still a very good DIPA. A very well-hidden alcohol makes this one dangerous. Nice job, Fred on another great beer.";;;;;;;;;;
This beer was served in an Imperial Pint glass.;;Appearance: The beer pours a cloudy orange coloration. The head is a fluffy white color. The head has good retention.;;Smell: The aroma of the beer leads with orange/ lemon citrus. Oily pine tones play on the bready maltyness.;;Taste: The flavor of the beer leads with pine oilyness. This combines very well with sweet citrus. The finish of the beer brings a flash of sweetness but finishes dry.;;Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer presents with a medium body. The hops are fairly oily in a good way. The beer is an easy drinker. I would easily reccomend this beer to hop lovers.;;
"On tap at Sammy's in Belmont, NC.	Pours a very clear golden orange color with a thick white head and tons of pretty lacing. Smells of orange and tons and tons of piny and grassy hops. Tastes like Jesus, of citrus and an unrelenting blast of palate numbing hops. Just awesome. Mouthfeel is medium with a heavy carbonation. Overall, its just an awesome beer, by far the best I have tried from Founders.";;;;;;;;;;
"Served cool from a 12 oz can into a Boston Lager glass.		Pours crystal clear with a fluffy off-white head that leads loads of lacing on the glass. Nice orange light-amber color bordering on light coppery tone.		Aroma is just loaded with citrusy, tangerine hops. Not much subtlety there.		Flavor is a lot more complex. There's tangerine, pine, and floral hops. A touch of caramel and a touch of maltiness, and even a touch of grassiness. Nicely ""balanced"" (for what it is) but practically speaking, still hop-heavy.		Mouthfeel is suitably bitter, but not near the max of the style, and has a nice dry finish--refreshing compared to many heavy, sugary IPAs in its class. 		Drinkability is good, but the bitter front and dry finish might actually go better with a bit less flavor and aroma. This is a nice complement to their Pale Ale, one of my favorite beers, and I think I like this one's hop bill even better. 		Highly recommended.";;;;;;;;;;
this beer poured a jet black color with no head into a tulip. the smell is of chocolate and coffee. it smells a bit sweet. the taste seems to be mostly coffee and the complexity i thought it would gain as it warmed never really happened. i thought the mouthfeel was great on this and it was easily drinkable, but not near as complex as i expected.;;;;;;;;;;
Served from a can into a pint glass. ;;Appears orange with a touch of gold. Foamy head present. ;;Smell is underwhelming. Don't puck up too much on the hops front. ;;Taste is good. There's sone hops with a tasty malt balance. ;;Mouthfeel is creamy and full. Nice! ;;Overall a pretty hoof experience. I'd have this again.
"Just picked up some of the new batch at Lakeview Binny's. Served in my trusty Surly pint glass.		A - Three fingers of medium-dark mocha foam that dissipates very slowly and leaves some patchy lacing. Black body with the tiniest sliver of dark brown at the bottom of the glass.		S - Dark roast coffee, baker's chocolate, roasted malts, light floral hoppiness, hint of tobacco and smoke, a little bit of dark fruits and vanilla. Pretty complex - it's what a coffee stout should taste like!		T - The taste has some pretty intense coffee bitterness, with more of a dark chocolate vibe happening. It's nicely balanced by sweet dark malts, vanilla, and a hint of fruit. Not as complex as the amazing smell (the light tobacco/smoke element is gone).		M - Low carbonation, super smooth and oatmealy, with a medium-thick body that's actually a little thinner than I remembered. It's like a slightly melted milkshake. Roasty and dry finish that I really like.		D - Damn, I put down most of this one in record time. The intense roastiness and slight coffee acidity might prevent me from having more than a few bottles, but this is super drinkable stuff.		This is one of those beers that I totally take for granted. I actually like this and KBS a lot more the Canadian Breakfast Stout.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12oz bottle... 		A- Pours with little to no head. Very cloudy with much sediment. Almost a brown/amber color. 		S- Caramel is the first scent that comes across. Some dried fruits are also noticeable. I get some light peanut smells, as well. 		T- Taste much molasses and caramel malts. I also get MUCH black cherry and a lot of 'brandy-like' flavors. A slight bitter finish, but not much on the back end besides the light alcohol warmth. 		M- A medium bodied brew with very little carbonation. Dry on the palate with warming from the alcohol. 		D- Not very drinkable, definitely a slow drinker with this one, especially at the 9.8%abv. This would definitely go well on a cold night at a fire. 		Cheers!";;;;;;;;;;
"An almost entirely flat pour, light trim. A gorgeous ruby red, with orange hues, a blackened chestnut away from the light. Held to the light you can see hundreds of tiny, suspended bubbles that mingle about all parts of the beer. A heavenly aroma - complex malt blend with varying degrees of roast. Quite the arragement of malts - very impressive. Some sticky, caramel toffee notes. Some piney, green hops. Very rich and sweet. Tremendously satisfying! The body a little less presence, I find this bottle has oxidized a tad in the cellar. It's not aged, but not fresh either. No alcohol present. Really soft malt. Quite a blend. Low hop bitterness. Scotch notes hint throughout. Overall, very light bodied, little texture, under carbonated (which may only be the fault of this bottle) Finishes on a really sutty, ash like, fire place type roastness, caps out the flavours nicely. Soft, mildly complex - the drinkability is fantastic, I really enjoyed this. 	Thanks for the trade Harry!";;;;;;;;;;
"Germinator Doppelbock, on tap at CBC on my last trip to Asheville. Served in a pint glass.		Appearance: Arrives a dark coffee brown, capped by a minimal and fast fading dull white head that leaves nothing but a thin collar. Very slow and large carbonation is visible, but there's not much here that's worth of commenting on.		Aroma: Hints of char float above dark toasty malts - faint cocoa, earth, toast - and a slew of fruits, nectarines and sweet cherries dominant among them.		Taste: Tons of flavor here, and a definite step up over the aroma. Coffee and dirty, earthy toast mingle with burned caramel and a slight nuttiness. Hints of fruit - darker fruits as well as lighter notes, mostly peach-esque - shine through as well, but this one is definitely a malt-centric doppelbock.		Mouthfeel: Smooth and moderately well carbonated, with an overwll avgerage body, very even and creamy, and it works well with the malt focused flavor profile.		Drinkability: This one definitely ends strong, and really grew on me as I drank it. It was the last of the CBC beers that was on tap that night that I enjoyed, and I thought I'd be ending on a low note. I was wrong, and this beer proved just as enjoyable as every other CBC beer I had that night. I've seen this one in growlers at various locations around the state of NC, and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good doppelbock.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a nice ruby color with an off white head. Leaves some nice lacing.		A nice sweet hoppy smell, not what I expected.		I would never guess this is a doppelbock. Doesn't taste like one at all, but in a really good way. Very hoppy throughout with a nice malt backbone that comes through especially in the after taste. Very tasty, I'm going to hunt down a case of this stuff if I can.		Good mouthfeel, less body than you would expect from a doppelbock, but at this point I should not even be thinking of this as a doppelbock.		Great drinkability.";;;;;;;;;;
Big thanks to cpetrone84 and Exiled for the chance to have multiple bottles of this one that were sent to me as extras in past trades! Served from bottle into a Delerium Tremens snifter. Poured a very hazy yellow-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of massively sweet malt, good vodka, and molasses. The flavor was of sweet malt, alcohol, molasses, and sugar. It had a heavy feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew. However, the booze on this thing was quite intense even with a year of age on it. To put it lightly this thing will lay a BEATING on your liver without a doubt. The sweetness aspect with the sugar on the followthrough helps to cut through the alcohol though. Has a good aroma, but despite smelling vodka (should have been my first hint), it didn't prepare me of the alcohol flavor I was about to experience. Should be great in another year or two without doubt.;;;;;;;;;;
A - Dark caramel with golden undertone. Not much of a head with moderate retention. Relatively clear for the darkness.;;S - The scent is pretty powerful as with most smoked beers. Reminds me of smoked bacon. The smell enhances the palate and gives you an expectation that is fulfilled.;;T - Very smooth with the obvious smoke flavor which obviously fits the brewmaster's intention. Has a caramel background. Overall a nice balance of flavor behind the smoke.;;M - Thicker than most but smooth and soft for the strong flavor. A lingering coating similar to smoking a cigar. Still relatively clean.;;D - Great to sip on but not something that you want to binge. Would definitely make my weekly rotation.;;
"Nice orange color, thin head fading head.		Floral grassy nose. Faint sweetness.		Taste was a little weak. Good balance and a grassy finish. I was hoping for something a little bigger.		Mouthfeel was okay. a little light on the carbonation.		Drinability is good. Nice aftertaste.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottled Feb 2, 2010, this is quite fresh. Served cool room temp into a Duvel tulip. Pours thick very dark brown/black with a one and a half finger dense brown head that maintains a light cap and leaves some spotty lacing. 		Aroma is very very roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, some smoke, roasty toasty. Can pick up a touch of earthy hops. 		Flavor is smooth milk chocolate, dark roasted malts, coffee, some bitterness on the finish along with some lingering sweetness. 		Mouthfeel is full, velvety, and rich, medium carbonation. Thicker and richer than many other regular porters. 		This is one of the best, if not the best porter out there. Excellent.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a cloudy amber color. Thin white head for an IPA. Ok lacing.;;Aroma could use more hops. Little bit of citrus and mostly malt. Smells ok though.;;Taste is better than the aroma would suggest. Pretty decent malt taste with a bit of hop bite. Could use a bit more hop flavor.;;Mouthfeel is a bit heavier than I like but good.;;Overall a tasty IPA. There are better avaliable to me but I might pick it up every once in a while.;;
"Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a pilsener glass.		Appears a semi-hazy gold color with lively carbonation. A one inch white head forms on top and settles to a nice cap that retains well. Upon closer inspection I can see lots of suspended tiny particles. Quite a bit of lacing is left on the glass. I'd rank it slightly higher if it weren't for the particles.		Aroma is grainy and bready with a touch of sweetness to it. A mild hop presence that is vaguely spicy and herbal. 		Taste is sweet up front with more breadiness. Hops are evident, but certainly not bitter. They contribute more of a crispness to the beer and a mild herbal character. There is also a honeycomb like sweet undertone which is almost buttery that lasts from the middle into the finish before it is taken over by the hops.		Mouthfeel is medium-light. A nice crisp carbonation that is good for the style. 		While it's not my favorite example of this style, this one was quite good. However, if it's on the shelf next to Weihenstephaner Original, I'm grabbing that.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance- Wow! This beer pours like very used motor oil with a low light brown head. Good lacing and decent retention. 		Smell- Roasty malts, dark coffee and a bit creamy 		Taste- rich,thick coffee, sweet molasses, raisins, a bit of dark chocolate, some bitter hops		Mouthfeel- Thick as the aforementioned 10 w 40. 		Drinkability- High ABV and huge flavor and still pretty smooth and drinkable. But if you try to knock down a bunch of these you'll end up crocked.";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at Winking Lizard.		This is a beer I see in nearly every store that carries Founders and recently at several bars. I finally gave it a shot last night.		Nice black color, dark brown around the edges. A dark khaki colored head of maybe a half inch or less. The head didn't last and I was left with no lacing.		Smelled pretty darn good. Lots of roasted coffee and charred toast in the nose. Really faint sweetness hidden beneath all of the malty goodness.		The taste is robust with lots of heavy chocolate malt flavor. Again, I was getting some roasted coffee notes which paired well with a mild hop bitterness present in the beer.		Fairly thin bodied, what would be expected out of a porter. Super carbonated, enough that I was wishing it were toned down some.		Really drinkable. You don't notice the alcohol and it's flavorful enough to keep you coming back.		Overall nothing amazing, but a really solid porter nonetheless.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured into a pint glass.;;A - Very nice hazy orange color with some mild brown hues. there is a nice dense .5 inch head that s retained very well. Recedes and leaves some nice lacing.;;S - Sweet grapefruit and citrus hints with some pine in there. Nice grassy hop character. Bready malt.;;T - Starts with a nice bready and almost buttery malt character that is quickly overtaken by some nice citric notes with some faint pine. The grapefruit side of the hops are more prevalent in teh style of a West Coast IPA. I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. It was delicious and medium bodied with nice complex hop notes and malt back bone. ;;M - Very nice smooth and crisp at the same time. Medium body and well balanced hop and malt character.;;D - Very high. Not too overwhelming.
"12 oz received as a very cool want-list extra from Brentk56... cellared since April.... refrigerated for the last week or so.. poured into my New Belgium snifter tonight.		1"" tan head dies back slowly leaving rings of lace as I swirl.. an a bunch of splotch bubbles... Brew is fairly clear chestnut brown.		Aroma is thick caramel punctuated by sweet cigar and leather.. hops are there.. but play second or even third fiddle to the malts... 		Flavor is again thick all the way around.. caramel and sweet but not cloying maltiness... bitterness may be on the light side.. but I appreciate a good malty barleywine.. spiciness shows up as it warms.. both hops and yeast... there is a pervasive and long finish of pipe tobacco.. tastes like the way a candy shop and a good walk-in humidor would smell if they were in the same room. Flavor is huge... but reminds me much more of a very very big boned English BW... there is a distinct fruitiness as it warms.. cherry essence.. maybe a little bit of plum... smoky.. and some piney hops become more evident as I sit here and it reaches room temperature... definitely some pine in there.... but the malts tend to gobble it up until the absolute finish.		Body is fairly thick with creamy but good carbonation.. 		I am really digging the Bearded Pat.. I know that there are a couple places that I can order this... I should pick up 12 for the next few years and see how they measure out.. but for now... I am damn.. very damn happy Brent included this brew.. now I just wish I would have had a BA/BW buddy around to share it with.";;;;;;;;;;
Pilsner Urquell:  A classic.  Deep golden color, pure white head, absolutely clear.  Strong spicy aroma of hops, with faint hints of malt.  Nice malt sweetness, with a long bitter/hop aftertaste.  Great balance.  Very drinkable, and goes great with appetizers.;;;;;;;;;;
"On tap: 		Puts a Lightly hazed amber orange lager in the glass...2 finger cap, good retention and lacing. 		Aroma: Like Schlenkerla but less intense and more malty. 		Moderate body, silky mouth feel. 		Moderate Bamberg-styled smoky malt blast at the front but well balanced with sweet Munich amber malts and noble hops, birch wood, earthy....lightly dry finish is smoke-malty but clean. 		A very decent rendition of the Bamberg style rauchbier...lacks Sclenkerla's intensity but is far better for drinkability. Rich in flavor, good quencher or with a grilled Bratwurst.";;;;;;;;;;
"pours a brown amber color with an off white, almost khaki colored frothy head.	as soon as i removed the cap, it was like opening the lid of a smoker. this smell of the beer is like the bark of slow smoked pork shoulder, that or some quality jerky. the smoked grain just dominated the aroma, and its an exceptional smell.	the smokiness is in the taste too, but differently. it tastes great. i've had only one other smoked beer before, but it was a smoked porter, and this beer has much much more smokey character to it, which is what i was hoping for.	this mouthfeel is very nice.	overall, i feel like this beer was a brand new experience for me. i loved it.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Off white head with decent retention. Crystal clear crimson liquid with amber highlights.	S: Slight bourbon increases as it warms	T: Bourbon. A mellow scotch. It stops short of being boozy thankfully. Some chocolate and vanilla. Tasty! Best as it's warmer.	M: Some heat. Round. Smooth	D: Mmmm! Strong, but I want another and would buy a 22 oz. or a 6-pack maybe (if it came as such, a 4-pack if in that).";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle served in an oversized wineglass.		pours a luscious, borderline black tone with a finger, finger and half of a tan/mocha head; average retention, although some nice walls of lacing are evident.		robust, aromatic nose greets me way before i lean in for my first whiff. bold notes of coffee interplay with a strong chocolate presence, followed by roasted malt. one of those literally mouth-watering aromas.		taste follows the nose, replete with rich coffee and bittersweet chocolate flavors. here is where i pick up on some oatmeal, although it's subdued. slightly bitter finish. to be honest, i was prepared to be disappointed after all the hype that fueled the reputation of the FBS, but this is pretty damn delicious.		full, velvety mouthfeel; moderately carbed. very, very drinkable for an imperial stout.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured strongly into a pint glass		A - pitch black with minimal dark khaki head, not too much lacing. Great color and thickness, but i would have liked to see more head		S - amazing...woody bourbon, hints of dark chocolate and coffee, dark roasted malts		T - very similar to the smell, only intensified. bourbon, coffee, chocolate, slight hint of vanilla, mild alcohol taste		M - thick, smooth and viscous, mild carbonation, feels like every inch of your mouth is being coated by the liquid		D - a very drinkable double/imperial stout. The alcohol presence is there, but balanced well. The beer is thick and heavy, but for the style it is pretty easily drinkable.		Overall, great beer...I can't wait to try this again and hopefully buy more of it next time.";;;;;;;;;;
"Hoppin' Frog Mean Manalishi	22oz. brown bomber		Poured into a snifter. It pours a cloudy amber with a nice white head, with light retention rate, and eventually leads to light lacing. Aromas are of citrus, pine, yeast, strong/high alpha hops, mild sweetness. Initial taste is of iced tea, followed by toasted malts, and caramel. This isn't what I expected for a 168 IBU Double IPA, but it is enjoyable. Mouthfeel is smooth and mellow. Not as hoppy as I expected. A very dangerous DIPA based on its smoothness, and especially at 8.2% ad in a bomber.";;;;;;;;;;
"I normally don't seek out pilsners, because it seems like most that I try are substandard, flavorless affairs. They're easy to drink because they're lacking in flavor. I'm rarely disappointed by the CBC so I wanted to give theirs a try.		Golden Slumbers, like its name, pours a lightly cloudy, golden color. It's topped by a compact, bright white head that fades to a persistent film leaving patches of lace. Like most pils, the aroma is fairly subtle with grassy and herbal hop notes, as well as a bit of peppery hops.		Clean, malt flavors upfront, with only a mild sweetness running throughout the beer. Peppery and herbal flavors appear in the center with an accompanying hop bitterness in the finish. Clean, simple, but flavorful. Light-bodied and vigorously carbonated with a crisp, mildly dry finish.		This is what I like in a pils, a nice amount of flavor with a nice hop presence in the finish.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a clear, deep burnt copper color, small half inch of thick white head that stays around forever. Muted, almost nonexistent aroma- some light notes of pine and faint toasted caramel. Flavor starts with sharp, earthy bitterness. Following the nose, notes of pine resin; some fresh cut marigolds and other floral notes, dry semi-sweet toasted malts. Malt shows some nutty notes as well. Palate is light and clean, with nothing lingering on the aftertaste. Decent beer.";;;;;;;;;;
This one pours a viscous, chocolaty black with a very light dark khaki head that dissipates very quickly. It smells very sweet and reminds me a lot of syrup and molasses. It is also moderately heavy on the bourbon and smells well roasted, in a sugary fashion. The taste is very good. It has a good, roasted malty sweetness to it. The bourbon really isn't apparent at all, or the alcohol. It drinks very, very smoothly and is a little thicker in body. It's very drinkable considering it's bourbon barrel aged and 8.5%. I don't normally like BBC but this one was pretty good.;;;;;;;;;;
"S - Grey Label bottle, no purple except on the 4 pack holdster. Limited Edition printed on top of body label. According to BA notes, this means the beer I am drinking is from 2004 or earlier which is certainly a pleasant surprise considering I almost soiled myself with joy when I saw it sitting top shelf.		A - BLACK. I hope that my coffin is this black inside when I die, if so I will never wake up and even if I do I wont be able to get out because it is so damn black. You know with other Imperial stouts how you can kind of see a little light get through around the edges, well with this there is just black. Head pours to about an inch and 1/2 then to a tight bubble blanket of light brown tightly joined foam. Jiminy Flip Flappin Christmas this stuff is like syrup when it pours, extraordinary is the only word to describe this.		S - Chocolate hits first and hard, then follows through with a very nicely balanced roastiness and dark fruity vapors, I think its cherry and . Caramel and creaminess also make their way through too. A delicate hit of alcohol spices the nostrils up a bit. A sweet note comes through along with the caramel and chocolate and lingrs through the whole quaff. A seriously complex beer, such a perfect example of art in a bottle.		T - Fruitiness hits accompanied by chocolate and coffee. Creamy and roasty go hand in hand, the whole sip just blends so well together, one sip seems like 20. You just get to the whole taste over and over again in a single drink. A warming character hits you in your chest quite gently and pleasant. Little touch of bitter at the end to finish it until the next drink, Wow.		M - Just covers your whole mouth from tongue to tooth. Not slick or unpleasant at all, it holds on only as long as it needs to and then some just to tickle your mouth that much more. Not overwhelming at all. Perfect, period.		D - If I could have this beer in my fridge all the time, I would be a spoiled little bastard. This beer is a perfect Imp. Stout. When I say perfect I really mean it. My first overall 5.";;;;;;;;;;
Aroma: Spicy aroma from hops. Some sulfur. Light bready notes.;;Appearance: Pours thick long lasting chunky white head. Light gold color. Very clear. Minimal lacing.;;Flavor: Soft well rounded palate. Spice not as prominent as in aroma. Medium-high bitterness. Pilsner malt dominats. Slightly grainy Dry in finish.;;Mouthfeel: Medium high carbonation. Medium overall mouthfeel. Some alcohol in finish.;;Overall: Not as crisp as I expected but still an excellent well rounded beer. The softness of this beer really jumped out and surprised me right away. I've never had a beer with that character. This beer really lives up to the hype.;;
"2011 Vintage. Picked this bottle up at the Whole Foods on P St NW in DC. Served in a Founders tulip. Reviewed from my tasting sheet.		Pours a bright light purple color that is quite similar to a light grape juice. Really nice head with a slight pinkish hue. Spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings loads of raspberry to the level of Barq's Raspberry Cream Soda. Not much depth, but I don't really care, especially once it gets into the flavor. There is some slight yeastiness on the backend of the flavor, but for the most part this is just a raspberry assault that is absolutely beautiful. Some light earthiness, especially in the feel. Lightly tart and fairly sweet, though not too much. Really outstanding beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"I got a bottle of this stout at Sunset Grill in Allston, MA. It comes at a high price, but definitely a beer that is worth the cost. If anyone could tell me where to I can pick up Founders beers in a liquour store in the Boston area, it would highly appreciated since I haven't found one that carries them yet. 		On to the beer, this is one of my favorite beers. I like beers thick and dark, that's what you get with this one. When it is poured out of the bottle, it has little to no head and looks like you may be about to drink molasses. When tasting, you feel strong hits of chocolate and coffee, as you do with many of these types of beers, but this one comes off with just the right amount. This beer is thick and doesn't go down like water, so you'll be able to enjoy it longer. 		I guess the best way to put it is like this; if you are a fan of imperial stouts or porters, you are going to love this beer. Like I said, it is going to set you back a few dollars, but it's worth the cost for such a high quality beer.";;;;;;;;;;
This brew pours a reddish color with a massive fluffy white head. The aroma is even more massive than the head. Smoked meat, and jerky. Spicy too. At first the taste is slightly shocking, because it isn't as in your face as the aroma is. But, after a couple sip, it really grows on you. It is smokey with some malty untertones. The mouthfeel is somewhere between medium and thin bodied with nice carbonation. Overll, this is a wonderful beer for a lazy fall afternoon.;;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at Capone's.		Pours a clear golden color with a single-finger white head and some nice sticky lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward a bit of straw and grain along with a strong thrust of floral hops. Lots of nobility in this one. Some herbal characteristics as well, though mostly floral. The flavor is a really nice split between light straw-like grain and a robust bouquet of Noble hops. Really, really beautifully done. Light and crisp with a moderate-to-heavy bitterness (for the style) in the finish. Really excellent. What an example of what this style could be. Very, very well done, sirs.";;;;;;;;;;
22oz bottle from Ale Yeah! in Decatur. Pours a dark orange with a somewhat short head. Redolant of spices in the nose. Nice cinammon, ginger, and lesser nutmeg aromas. Slightly sweet in the mouth, with bubblegum to start, followed by more spice- particularly ginger, with some cinnamon and nutmege in equal parts, and a finish that has more maltiness. Quite nice for the winter. Smooth, slightly sweet, and a bit nutty on the finish. I enjoyed this.;;;;;;;;;;
"What a RIS looks like. Black, oily, thick and viscous. A tan head instantly fades into a splotch of tan bubbles and a surrounding ring around the neck of the snifter.		Full of chocolate and black fruits in the nose. Vanilla, toasty oak, and very light bourbon. A slight must and effervescence of blueberry. Roasted malts as well.		Well balanced and very nice!! The barrel aging added a soft and roundness to the mouthefeel and really helps the drinkability compared to regular BORIS. Bourbon doesn't show overly so, slightly in the finish. Big chocolate, caramel, vanilla, toasty oak, black currant, hints of blueberry. Burnt milk chocolate covered caramel. Would love to drink this daily.";;;;;;;;;;
Expecting a gimmick, I was pleasantly surprised with this very good beer. Auburn/copper in colour, with a decent one finger head that lasted. Whisps of lace stick to the glass. Bit of toffee, fruit, malts, earth, grass and caramel in the nose. A rather odd blend that smells pretty damn good. Taste, hmm... Delicious. Lightly sweetened with malts, toffee and fruit, mingling with this down to earth bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and buttery. However, this is quite the exceptional pale ale and one I shall be buying again.;;;;;;;;;;
"I'm reviewing this one so I can add another state to my profile. And it's a pretty good beer. Yazoo is a hidden gem down in TN.		Opaque black with about a one finger french vanilla head. Slowly settles to a foamy ring along the glass. When I lift the glass, there are ruby highlights at the bottom around the edge. 		The aroma is light but still has a good amount of complexity. A touch of molasses is in the background, along with some chocolate. The rye adds a dry graininess.		The rye sets up the base with a little bit of a sour tinge. There are some hops in there as well that compliment it well with a bit of bitterness. The hops are balanced with a little bit of sweet chocolate. The roasted malts come though as well, and come out almost like roasted black coffee. Rather full bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. The chocolate and coffee hang on well after each sip.		A very good porter, and I'm not sure I've ever had one with rye. A good stand up beer, well made, well rounded, and definitely worth a six-pack at least. Recommended.";;;;;;;;;;
"Wow, this beer is good. 		The 12 oz. bottles that I have are going to be a very good addition to my fridge. Just a great experience, considering I cannot get this on the west. 		The appearance is really nice for a Stout, the only reason that I did not give it a perfect five is because it was not thick consistency wise. It poured dark brown, and held up to the light nothing comes through, but doesn't look like motor oil. Poured a great three finger head that had a caramel-brown color. 		The smell is great, all I smell is overwhelming coffee with an incredibly bitter cocoa. 		The taste is so crazy. It tastes like chocolate coffee, there is not doubt in that. It also has a really light mouthfeel, I cannot tell if it is the carbonation bouncing on my tongue or someother ingredient, maybe the yeast. I kind of wonder what this would taste like warm. Probably awesome. 		The mouthfeel is really trippy because it almost seems ""light"" or really bounces on the palate like an IPA or overhop beer would. I am really enjoying it, would buy more if I could. I am going to have one when I wake up tomorrow morning. 		J";;;;;;;;;;
"Appears a transparent copper with a small, beige head that quickly fades out into a mild cap and hearty, velvet collar. Spotty streaks of lacing are left around the glass. Tiny amounts of CO2 bubbles slowly rise to the top.	Smell is of hop blasts with consisting notes of floral, herbal, tea leaves, pine sap, grapefruit, dry grapenuts, and caramel malt.	Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a doughy, fruity yeastiness really taking control of the flavor and making it more English Ale like with notes of herbal tea and sugar.	Mouthfeel is medium bodied, bitter from the yeast and hop selection that carries mostly notes of herbs that collapse on the middle of the tongue in a dry fashion after starting off with a caramel sweetness.";;;;;;;;;;
"Purchased as a single from Picadilly in Champaign. No freshness dating or born on date. Again, interesting and eye-catching labeling from Founder's. Yes, they make good beer, but they do their best to make sure you try it.		Pours a muted red with brown highlights. Pretty two fingered tan head. Eventually dissipates to super sticky ring with excellent retention. 		Nose full of citrusy hops mixed with a bit of spice and caramel malts. 	Mmm, the tropical fruit hop laden mixture is creamy smooth. Spicy mix in the beginning and middle. Mid to full flavored, finishing spicy, sweet, and bitter. 	Very drinkable. This stuff could get me in trouble.";;;;;;;;;;
"16.9 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. 		Pours a very deep blackish mahogany. One and a half finger head quickly dissipates into a thin coating that gradually disappears as I drink.		Aroma is very sweet with notes of raisins, figs, caramel, brown sugar, and chocolate. 		Flavors of figs, brown sugar, raisins, and a little chocolate and coffee at the end. 		Very malty beer with a creamy medium-full mouthfull. Finishes fairly dry and leaves a bit of an alcoholic warming sensation. 		Overall, a great beer that I would certainly drink again.";;;;;;;;;;
"A-Oil can black with a quarter inch brownish head that disappeared with a small white cap.		S-Pleasant. Smokey sweet fruit aroma		T-smooth dark malt, tangy bitterness on the tongue, moderate to strong smoky flavor on the finish.		M-ample full bodied but not cloying		D-the alcohol is very well hidden. The smokiness took a little getting used to but I could drink several of these. Very well done.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle poured into a Redoak globe style glass. Massive thanks to mulder1010 for shipping this back from his recent trip to the States.		Nice silky looking pour, jet black in appearance with a tan coloured head of foam that builds up after the pour and sat at half a finger in height and settles as film pretty quickly.		Amazing ever-changing aroma, starts off which cereal and oat with even a touch of milk which made me pretty well beside myself. Coffee then comes through and chocolate is the last to make an appearance. 		Taste is mainly coffee upfront with chocolate working well with it later on to balance it out well. So a bit of bite early from the coffee and the smoothness which follows is a real treat.		Booze is very well hidden in this, lovely velvety mouthfeel at the finish, while a bit of spark earlier helps ensure that this is no one-trick pony in this regard.		Overall an incredible beer, huge thanks for mulder1010 for sourcing and shipping this! Everything you could expect and more.";;;;;;;;;;
(From notes) Poured a vivid orange gold with a thin film of tight white head. Traditional IPA aromas that skew more to the gentle floral/honey side of the spectrum.;;Moderate carbonation and a full mouthfeel. Was very pleasantly surprised by the balance of flavors going on -- floral hops and pineapple up front followed by mild honey/caramel sweetness and a slightly tart grapefruit bitterness on the finish. Hint of alcohol warmth rounded this one out -- would love to try this again!;;;;;;;;
"A - I've been cellaring this brew since October of 2008. Tonight is the night. It has a perfectly black body topped by a thick, foamy, dark tan head that starts out at two plus inches and fades ever-so-gently. I can't wait to try it.		S - Dark anise and subtle chocolate.		T - Again the anise comes through but in this case it is a bit potent. There is a revealing of the alcohol content but not in an overwhelming manner. There are bitter plums here as well.		M - The soft, smooth, relaxing texture of this porter is a pleasure. There is slight hint of abrasion, but only enough to add to the brew's character.		 ~ This is not a brew for the meek. If you're interested in trying an interesting and complex brew I suggest you give this one a try.";;;;;;;;;;
"Reviewed from notes for tasting on 6/9/2011. 2011 Batch		A- Golden, sparkling, clear, and good carbonation. I can't believe how light this beer is. Very misleading appearance once you take the first sip, but it is a beautiful brew. I'm not sure how they get all that hop and alcohol in such a light brew. 		S- Grapefruit and alcohol come through in the nose. Smells as an IIPA should		T- Citrusy sweetness with the faintest taste of malt up front with crushing bitterness at the end. The bitterness lingers long after the drink goes down. alcohol, though noticeable in the smell, is imperceptible in the taste. 		M- Crisp, clean, and refreshing. Lighter bodied that some in the same class. Very smooth drinking beer.		O- This is one of the best value priced IIPA's out there, imo. It has great flavor and really hits the spot no matter what you are craving. Drink it cold on a hot day, or room temp on a cool day. I like this beer so much that I am continuing my quest in cloning it homebrew style.";;;;;;;;;;
"Dark for a pilsner with a very nice, foamy head.		Smells like a very malty german pils. Strong on the grains with just a hint of white pepper in the back. 		Tastes grainy upfront, grainy in the back, too, only with a little bit of the aforementioned pepper and a quite pleasant hop that leaves a very nice, dry aftertaste. 		The crisp body and medium carbonation lead to a clean, very drinkable beer.";;;;;;;;;;
Vintage 9/19/02. The body is black but shows brown highlights at the base of the glass. It's capped by a foamy tan head that drops shortly but keeps a creamy collar. Unfortunately, it leaves little lace (probably in part due to a high level of alcohol). The nose is roasty with a touch of peat, dark fruit and a dark, acidic malt that upon further investigation reveals some minor caramel notes. Its medium body is accentuated by its fine, tiny bubbled natural carbonation that leaves it smooth and creamy across the palate. It's rich, mouth-coating malt displays caramel/toffee (even a thin note of chocolate), dark fruit (raisins, black berries) and a soft roastiness not unlike that of French roast coffee. A low pH from the dark malt leaves it slightly acidic, and the low level bitterness balances just enough to keep the malt from becoming cloying. Alcohol runs through the center of the flavor, adding rather than detracting, by helping to cut the sweetness and thinning the residual malt in the finish. Some lingering fruit and a touch of piney/grassy hop flavor add to it's charm. Rich, complex, and satisfying. Definitely distinct in the Scotch ale category.;;;;;;;;;;
"Growler shared by Ding - thanks!		Pours one shade away from black with a half-finger tan head. The head recees into a wispy layer on top leaving decent lacing.		Smells of smooth roasted malts with hints of chocolate and citrus hops. 		Tastes similar to how it smells. Roasted and chocolate malt flavors up front are joined midway through the sip by solid amounts of citrus hop flavors and milder hits of pine hop flavors. Ending is mildly bitter, leaving a dark chocolate aftertaste.		Mouthfeel is good. It has a solid thickness with moderate carbonation.		Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could polish off a growler myself.		Overall I thought this was more of a Double Stout than a DIPA, but we don't need to get into semantics and either way it was good. Worth a shot.";;;;;;;;;;
"This is a Brandy Barrel Aged D/IIPA.		Served into brandy snifter.		Served with 1/2 finger of white head. Color is a clear golden orange.		Aroma: Very sweet brandy, oak, and vanilla. Fresh floral hops. Bright citrus kick.		Taste: Very fresh floral hops. This IIPA has a huge fruit citrus taste. Grapefruit, pineapple, lemon citrus. Oak and warm brandy flavors. Top of the line IIPA. Very fresh with a nice brandy addition.		Mouthfeel: Bitter and smooth but warm. Full bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Ends a bit sticky.		Overall, this is a solid -bal aged iipa. Normally -bal aged/oak aged ipas are awful because the hops are faded but this was very fresh. Reminded me a bit of Devil Dancer. Very drinkable and I love the addition of the brandy -bal aging.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours pitch black with a dense tan head that leaves sheets of lacing.		Aroma is slightly sweet. Dark grain, chocolate, and coffee really stand out along with bourbon alcohol heat. 		Taste is initially rich chocolate and coffee. Then a sublime combination off vanilla and maple, along with a pleasant oak quality. Tobacco and brown sugar really rounds the flavor out. Finishes with bourbon heat that lingers that really complements the the chocolate and oaky vanilla notes.		Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy and smooth. 		A rich and flavorful stout. Very interesting, but not overpowering in intensity. Instead there is layers of subtle flavor notes that peak through, especially as it warms and the bourbon asserts a stronger presence. Very nice.";;;;;;;;;;
"Beer pours with a nice golden color, with a decent head and good carbonation. The aroma not distinct as it had a grainy smell.	The taste is crisp and refreshing with a medium body and dry finish. Beer is very drinkable and a good session beer.		I understand there have been some changes to the brewing process. Too bad they messed with the original.";;;;;;;;;;
"A very interesting beer, I mussay. Pours a dark brown tone with a little white head that fizzes away with much ease. The body is contundently opaque and has no carbonation.		The smell is strong and clearly marks a smoked feeling that is present in the beer itself. A little old smelling as well, hoppy and wheaty.		But the taste is shocking. Unexpected for me at any level for me, the smoked meat-like taste, not a bad one at all and worth repeating, is unlike any other beer ive ever tried and it pleases me to have been introduced into this new rauchbier style. The mouthfeel is thick but nice et all. The drinkability is good as long as your budget allows this rare specimen here in Paris.";;;;;;;;;;
"Lucky to obtain a bottle of this one! Poured into a Duvel tulip. Deep, black, motor oil body; thick. Two-finger head that is a little darker than mocha. The head dissipates fairly quickly, but leaves a little lacing.		Rich aroma. The maple is definitely present and is the primary difference from KBS. But, the sweet chocolate aroma dominates, with hints of bourbon and coffee.		The flavor is also very rich, sweet but blended extremely well with the many tastes that are present: chocolate, bourbon, maple, coffee, roasted malt. I also get a light hint of hops on the back side as it warms.		Thick mouthfeel, but surprisingly drinkable with all the flavor and the abv. I get very little alcohol. Another superb stout from the kingdom of excellent stouts - Founders.";;;;;;;;;;
Deep brown with amber highlites-a good sticky while minimal head that is accompanied by very ample lace. Strong in the aroma department with black coffee followed by a burst of hop-some sweet malt faintly chimes in. Big and rich in the mouth with a creamy viscous texture. Flavors run deep-caramel, dark chocolate, fruitcake, black licorice, and plenty of twangy hop to keep it interesting. The finish continues long and deep-the only way to stop the delightful lingering flavor would be to get out some grub. I can see this standing up to something rich and meaty-perhaps a dry aged hanger steak accompanied by some fries, and a side of super fresh, crispy vegies of choice. Or maybe a beef stew with plenty of potato, pea and carrot!? A great choice for a Winter Warmer!;;;;;;;;;;
Bottle via trade with kryptic. Coffee dominates the aroma. Not roasted or roasting) but spent grounds and cold press. There's some bitter chocolate and darkly roasted malt as well. Pours as deep, dark brown... almost black with a fairly long lasting reddish brown head. Lots of sticky golden/brown oily legs down the glass after a gentle swirl. The chocolate and coffee are more balanced on the palate with the chocolate hitting you first and the coffee on the backside of the palate. There's an odd salty component that I can't quite put my finger on. Alcohol is expertly hidden. Fairly full bodied and creamy. Finishes with a lasting bitterness.;;;;;;;;;;
"Presentation: 16.9 fl oz bottle with no freshness date, brewed According to the Reinheitsgebot 1516 on the label.		Appearance: Tawny reddish hue with a thin lacing after an ample froth. Clarity is good and retention is at least stable.		Smell: Intense but not overwhelming smoky aroma, fresh charred wood with a light maltiness are that make-up of the nose.		Taste: Moderate body, clean and crisp. Slap of the wheaty twang plus a faint clove hits the same time as a wall of soft smokiness blankets the palate. Lightly woody, soft smoke and a ghost like char flavour add subtle complexities. Maltiness is a great base with a touch of sweetness and fresh grain. Long faded smoky after taste that land semi-dry.		Notes: A simple yet deep smoked brew, quite drinkable and pairs best with lighter dishes like apple wood smoke chicken or a mildly smoked pork shoulder laced with BBQ sauce.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours black in color with a brown head. Aroma consists of sweet milk chocolate & powdered cocoa, molasses, grain, roasted barley and expresso coffee. Thick, chewy mouthfeel. Flavors abound with those of dark roasted coffee, molasses and roasted malt. Frech roast coffee and expresso flavors treat the tongue. Some hop bitterness emerges toward the back.		For a stout and coffee lover this is a must have beer. It's a little heavy overall and on the alchohol, but so be it. This is one that's meant to truly be savored. It's THAT good.";;;;;;;;;;
"On-tap at the Church Key - love their twitter updates, always keeping me informed on their brews. In any case, I've been looking for this one for ever, so was very excited to find it in my area. Pour was pitch black with no highlights, a small finger of tan head that left solid lacing on my glass. Nose is a little milder than expected - surprisingly fruity, chocolate and roasted malt. Nice, but nothing compared with the monstrous flavor that comes through. Huge chocolate and roasted malt up front. Then the maple syrup shows up subtly, adding a sort of unique spicy vanilla flavor. Really big, delicious flavor. Body is thick and creamy, full, with smooth carbonation that works perfectly. Overall, this beer was near perfect for me. Exceptional taste and drinkability, all kinds of complexity. Would unquestionably have this again if I ever had the opportunity. 		Church Key/$9/10 oz";;;;;;;;;;
"Finally, Devil Dancer on tap at Capones in Norristown. Nice an fresh too! Poured into a snifter glass. 		A: A clear dark orange and almost light brown color with a minimal slight white head. No glass lacing.		S: Wow, just popping with earthy piney hops. Some slight citrus on the nose and a deep sweet bready caramel malt. This is a hop bomb waiting to happen.		T: Hops assault the tongue immediately. Huge hop flavors of pine, earth, a bit of floral tones and a bit of citrus. The bitterness jumps in right away. The huge caramel malt tries to subdue the hops but they have no part in this. The massive bitter hops dominate the end and finish with a punching blow to the mouth. Wow, this beer if freaking incredible from tap when fresh. Bitterness pounds the mouth long after the beer is gone. Wow, just wow.		M: Full, massive, prickly, sweet, bitter. Did I say bitter? Yes! Alcohol is very noticeable but not overly intrusive. Crazy good.		D: For 12%? Insanely good. Get this straight though, this is a beer to be enjoyed over a good period of time, not a beer to pound down.		Overall I can't believe the difference in this beer from tap (fresh) to bottle. The tap version just pops so much more with flavor and raw hops bitterness. The beer is crazy good and I have become even a bigger fan of it. I am still shaking my head as to how good this was. If you like it from bottle, I beg of you to get it on tap. Incredible. Mindblowing.		I bow to Founders once again.";;;;;;;;;;
Aquired this brew in a trade with mcallister. Thanks for sending me some great beer! Served at cellar temperature into a pint glass. Poured a very deep oily black color that no light could pass through. About two good fingers of tight, thick, bubbly dark brown head formed. Head had pretty good retention. Smell: Wonderful aromas of strong roasted coffee beans, sweet milk chocolate, notes of toffee and caramel rose from the glass. Awesome nose on this one. Taste: Tons of flavor here. Coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, and some spicey black licorice. All balanced out just about perfectly. Delicious. Mouthfeel was full and thick, with little carbonation. Pretty creamy and complex. I could drink this all day long. Great offering from Hoppin' Frog.;;;;;;;;;;
"A: Deep brown with a nice fluffy tan head. 2-fingers to start, slowly receding. Perfect.		S: Nice roasted malt with some slight hops.		T: Lots of bitter chocolate and some coffee backing in this stout. The roasted malt tastes great and goes down smooth. As it sits in the mouth, it creams up, and after swallowing a little more bitterness comes out along with some great fresh hop flavor.		M: Creamy, medium-heavy bodied, good carbonation, barely astringent.		D: Very drinkable. It's heavy, but it's great.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle poured into Surly pint glass.		Pours a dark orange with a nice foamy head.		Smell- Citrus such as orange and lemon as well as carmel malt in the background		Taste- Similar to smell with Grapefruit, orange, lemon and pineapple upfront followed by carmel malt.		Mouthfeel- A Nice amount of carbonation and medium bodied IPA		Overall- Another solid beer from Founders. Not a mind-blowing brew, but a well balanced IPA you can easily drink more than one of.";;;;;;;;;;
Pretty similar to the regular offering, plus bourbon, oak and vanilla. Pours a thick black color with a smallish dark brown head. Aromas of bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark chocolate covered espresso beans. On the palate, a little thinner than the regular version, with a good amount of bourbon/oak flavor. Good, but nothing remarkable.;;;;;;;;;;
"a: initial flourish of carbonation quickly recedes to only a thin string around the glass, deep amber-garnet in color		s: rich toffee and caramel malts suggest date, plum, and raisin, estery banana bread, cigar box, decidedly malt centric with only a mildly spicy hop aroma, very nice aroma that carries its lopsided profile just fine		m: low, delicate carbonation carried on a viscous but not overly heavy body		t: rich toffee malts with sugary dates, dried tobacco, toasted bread after the swallow, dries slightly in the finish with a mild hop presence		d: no problem		single picked up at Whole Foods, Reston, VA";;;;;;;;;;
12oz bottle poured into snifter... ;;Dark brown w/ fizzy head that doesn't stick around long;;Coffee aroma with some vanilla/oak...Tastes of old coffee and little bourbon.. some chocolate in ther too;;NO lacing and I thought I got a whiff of pancakes in there....thin mouthfeel.;;Decent beer....I could knock down a few for sure.;;
A nice dark red/amber color with about 1.5 finger head of off-white creamy head. The head stuck around for about 3/4 of the brew and left some nice lace.;;The smell was pretty tame a little woody and a little fruity.;;The taste was a decent mix of malt and hops but I think the hops won out in the end. The aftertaste is very dry and a bit nutty. The low level carbonation makes this a easy beer to put down and one sip naturally leads you to another. If it wasn't for the price barrier this would be in my usual list.;;;;;;
"On tap at Haymarket		A- cloudy dark orange. White head that fades quickly but lacing coats the glass		S- sweet malts, oranges, and grapefruit		T- sweet malts, lots of orange with some grapefruit. Nice citrus hop bitterness.		M- medium body, very creamy and smooth		O- one of the better offerings I have had here. Would have again.";;;;;;;;;;
It has a dark bronze and amber body. The head and lace are full, rocky and tan. The aroma is sweet but there is some yeast spice and little floral accents. It reminds me of a pale ale flavor a bit bitter, grapefruit like but has a sweet melon finish. The mouthfeel is medium. The carbonation had a lot of staying power.;;;;;;;;;;
"A- Light orange, beautifully transparent, 3/4"" lacing head		S- Very floral and citrusy, not as overpowering as most IPA's, perfectly balanced		T- I love this Beer. It's perfectly balanced, citrusy hops and smooth finish		M- Medium-bodied, the perfect mouth feel, not over bitter, the perfect amount of hops were used		D- Not as easy to drink like most session beers, but not as bitter as most IPA's		This is one of my favorite anytime beers. I used to pick up a case every week when it was $25. I prefer this over Sierra Nevada plus it's local. Will try to pick up a keg of it soon for the new kegerator.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from one of two cellared bottles at near cellar temperature to a half-pint glass.		A: Glugs from the bottle a rich, oily near-black. A fizzy lavender-brown head - yes, I said lavender - crests at about half a finger and dissipates fairly quickly; I'll attribute this to a warmer serving temperature(?). Held to light, this is virtually black, with only a sliver of ruddy amber hugging the edges. 		S: Ho hum, just another awesome-smelling RIS. This one is big on the sweeter malts (thank you, oatmeal) with ample doses of vanilla, molasses, and chocolate-covered cherries. Only a trace of the medicinal bittering and a souring oxidation. Not quite as rich and complex as I'd hoped for; coffee, where are you?		T: Oh, very nice. Begins a little sweet: slightly smoky, tangy barbecued flavor. But ashy charcoal, tanned leather, and deeply-burnt grain quickly dispel any notions that this one will skimp on the bitterness. A full-on infusion of raw, ground coffee, splashed with drops of pure vanilla extract and juicy citrus hopping follows. Wow, this one builds and builds until, after several minutes, the taste buds beg for mercy. 'Only' 60 IBU's? Seems alot more bitter than that... 		M: Smooth, velvety, flowing rich and full across the tongue and then grabbing hold. As thick as this one looked going into the glass, it was almost as thick in the mouth. This one developed slowly but surely, a thinner and more viscous mouthfeel at first, then layering warmth with each sip. Long-, long-, lo-o-o-n-g-lasting bitterness - the deepest and richest coffee roast I've encountered in a while.		D: Something to sip and savor - one of my new favorite RISs. A rich and complex ale worthy of high praise, one I'm very glad to have tried and will look forward to enjoying again. Very highly recommended. Thank you to jpm30 for sending a while ago...";;;;;;;;;;
"I received this via BIF Across America from Jay23, thanks.	Definitely an unfiltered beer here. Big beautiful head and a murky amber color.	It smells like Centennial hops, that's pretty much all I can smell. The flavor is really hoppy also, the initial sensation is of grapefruit and then the aftertaste is very piney. There is a residual bitterness that makes its presence known in between sips.	The body is big and chewy and you can tell it is very viscous just from swirling it in the glass, there is a ton of lacing.	I definitely enjoyed this and would certainly pick more up if given the opportunity.";;;;;;;;;;
"This was a big time want of mine and was graciously provided back about this time last year in the Fight Club: Project Mayhem BIF... Czoch75 devastated my wants list... I shared this with the usual suspects over the weekend.... Thanks doesn't say enough.... Clint, you are a Rock Star!!		Deep amber.. very clear... sorta thin yellowish tan head... still nice lacing... pour looks viscous.		Nose shows thick caramel and a bit of unidentifiable spice and some background cherry.		Flavor is complex.... a bit of raisin and some figgy qualities... some mild yeasty phenols remind me slightly of white pepper and minor clove... but the proof is in the great malt profile... yummy ... Eric kept thinking this was ""wood aged""? I don't think so, I was just amazed at all the flavor packed into the bottle.		Body was medium/full with a lighter than expected carbonation that lended well to the mouthfeel.		I was able to pick out the ""Belgian"" yeast qualities a bit, but overall, this was a very nice BW... I honestly believe it could still handle another year or two pretty readily.		Thanks again Clint for the beatdown... It was a good hurt ... Now when are we gonna do it again? :-)		4/4/4.5/4.5/4";;;;;;;;;;
"poured a farily dark, medium brown with a fair tan head.	lacing was minimal	smelled a bit roasty, with chocolate malt and some breadiness.	taste was mild, a slight roasty but very smooth. true to style in my opinion.	finished clean, with a lingering feel of hops on the palate.	mouthfeel was pretty smooth and full.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a light head that mostly dies but leaves some lacing.		Smells of sweet vanilla, oak and bourbon. Very nice.		Taste is definitely overwhelming oak and bourbon characteristics. Unfortunately, the complexities of the beer are kind of lost against the barrel aging of this beer. I'd be curios to try a non-BA version of this. Regardless, this has a lot going for it.		Mouthfeel and drinkability are noting too special.";;;;;;;;;;
From the first bottling run. Much thanks to Deuane for bringing a few of these back from OH for me. Out of a 22 ounce bomber bottle and into my tulip. The stout appears a nearly pitch black color with a healthy two fingers of creamy tan foam. Nose and flavors consist of deep roasted grains, both dark and bittersweet chocolates at varying degrees of intensity, raisins, prunes, a good amount of sweetness, almost too much at times. I recall reading that this particular batch only spent a few (3-4?) months in the barrels and it shows. Bourbon notes are mild, but certainly present. This one is quite viscous with medium carbonation. The bubbles help to cut through the richness. This is, without a doubt, a sipper for sure. Glad I got into it while it's still chilly out. Thanks again D!;;;;;;;;;;
"My first review ever but this beer was so good I had to say something.		Poured the color of chocolate tar. Used a pilsner glass and the head started thinly. So I poured directly at the bottom and got a thick creamy head which I allowed to settle. The 8.3 was so well hidden by the complex smooth mouth and taste that I ""almost"" missed the alcohol. Over 30 minutes, the outstanding balance shifted from chocolate to chocolate tinged coffee. All the while the oatmeal background made the transition as sooth as silk with a constant mouth throughout. Absolutely loved the head laces on the glass when it was empty.		If you enjoy this type beer don't miss it. Simply among, if not the best of its type I've ever had.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from bomber into tulip glass.		A: Ink black, thick as oil, with a 1-finger rich creamy dark chocolate milk colored head that disappears quickly, leaving a thin film and a ring that hugs the glass. Small, spotty lacing. 		S: Rich whiskey-soaked, vanilla-infused dark chocolate truffles with a splash of espresso and drizzled in a thick sugar-glazed stone fruit reduction. Alcohol heat as well. If only there was a dessert that existed in the form of how this beer smells.		T: Bourbon, vanilla, oak, rich chocolate, a shot of espresso, and some sticky dark fruits. Alcohol. One helluva beer. This would be incredible with a year or two of age on it to let the alcohol mellow out a bit and the flavors meld and mature, but it's quite delicious now as well. I'll have to pick up another bottle to age!		M: Rich and creamy, but it doesn't stick quite as much as you'd expect a giant barrel-aged imperial oatmeal stout to. Well-carbonated for a big RIS - tingles a bit on the tongue. Plenty of warmth from the alcohol. Leaves the classic RIS sticky lips syndrome. A little chalky.		O: An outstanding barrel-aged stout. The bourbon and barrel presence is very up-front but the intensity is more reserved compared to most bourbon barrel-aged stouts (Goose Island Bourbon County stout comes to mind) - the underlying stout shines through spectacularly. Currently second only to KBS in my opinion so far in my experience, though a somewhat distant second :) KBS, especially the 2011 vintage, is a much more refined beer, but this one put a big smile on my face.";;;;;;;;;;
"pours an enchanting mahogany color, with a billowy off white head and very good lacing. The aroma is exactly like biltong (a smoked meat I used to eat in south africa, I think its actually wildebeast) with a shade of sweet malt as well. The tase is also like smoked meat, but much more complex. Theres a nice malty element that mingles so well with the smokiness. Theres also some detectable hops. 		The mouthfeel is very smooth in this full bodied beer. The finish is of subtle smoked meat, which is actually really good. Who would have thought that a lager could be made to taste so full flavored? Such an interesting beer, and a refreshing change from the regular malt/hop ales. Ill get it again for sure. It goes great with beef jerky, which is what I ate with it.";;;;;;;;;;
"Enjoyed with my brother-in-law while in Michigan this summer.		Appearance - Pours a slightly hazy, darker golden color into a pint glass. About a finger of white head is achieved that dissipates at a moderate pace leaving decent lacing.		Smell - Hops, spices, slight bitter citrus notes, and a malty/caramel aroma.		Taste - First and foremost, sweet malts and caramel. This is a very malt forward beer which I was not expecting. Granted, there are definite hop, pine, and bitter citrus flavors, however, it is just too damn malty for me.		Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, nice balance of carbonation, finishes a bit bitter/dry.		Drinkability - Ehh, for the ABV yes, but when I had Founders Centennial and Two Hearted in the refrigerator, I most defiantly went to grab those over this. Will not get this in the future.";;;;;;;;;;
"My buddy bought a 6-pk at Wegman's for our beer tasting night knowing how much we both enjoy IPA's...WOW!		A - Slightly hazy, amber color. Poured into a pint glass and was greeted with a nice, frothy head.		S - Very nice...the first thing that hits you is the citrus smell along with a nice sweetness aroma.		T - Again, outstanding. I'm a huge DFH fan and I have to say this ranks at least as high as their IPA 60 in my book. Great hoppiness and caramel taste. Nicely balanced.		M - Again, nicely done. Not overly carbonated but enough that it gives you a little bite.		D - In my book, an outstanding IPA. My buddy and I each finished two during our tasting and we both agreed that this is a great IPA. If it hadn't been that we had other beers to try, we would have continued to finish up the 6-pk. It's really that good. This is a beer I could easily see becoming a favorite. 		Highly recommend. Cheers!";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottled on 7/14/10.		Poured into a snifter.		Translucent, dark-brown body. Tons of mini bubbles in this barleywine. There's a nice thin and foamy tan head that slowly recedes into a cap. Dotted lacing up around the glass as well. On the nose is a thorough malt toastiness with hints of honey. There's actually barley characteristics to this beer, which really engulfs the nose. If there were hop aromas in this, the time passed since the bottling date really shows. No pine/citrus aromas detectable.		Begins with a sticky hop bitterness that immediately transitions into the malt/barley breadiness, alongside hints of dark fruits like figs and plums. Also, there's a noticeable caramel sweetness throughout the brew. Apparently, the 12% ABV was palpable for many before, but it's completely absent for me. Very smooth and flavorful. If you've got a single bottle of Nemesis 2010 but was apprehensive to open because of the booziness, I'd say it's safe to open to drink right now. It's drinking really great. Overall, the balance of bitter and sweet are on point with the alcohol being held at bay.		Medium-bodied- smooth and silky. Completely opposite of its carbonated appearance for sure. Drinks like a nice liqueur. I was a bit skeptical on paying $5.99 for a single 12 oz., but I find that it was worth it. If you've got a four-pack, drink one now and continue to age the rest. I'm sure this will be drinking very beautifully in the near future.";;;;;;;;;;
The overall appearance of this brew is an amber/pink. This is what you would expect of a drink based on cherries. It is a good session drink. However, as it warms up, the aftertaste and mouth feel is degraded by the sourness of the brew. In my opinion fruit flavored beers are either hit or miss. But, I would recommend this beer.;;;;;;;;;;
The beer is a very, very dark red. There is a little bit of a tan head. Some lacing down the glass. There is a rich aroma of chocolate and roasted malt. Very similar tastes to the aroma. It is more along the lines of a Dry Stout as opposed to an Imperial (as they claim on their web-site), but very good none the less.;;;;;;;;;;
"It is a great injustice that the word ""pilsner"" has been sullied by certain macro-brews. Urquell is a real pilsner.		The color is a lovely, clear 24k gold; a snow white head appears and quickly dissipates.		Full bouquet- hops, butter, pine sap, a bit of sulphur, and something faintly flowery, perhaps lavender.		This beer has a bracing bitterness that holds steadily into the finish. The flavors reflect the aroma, with the butter and pine sap predominating. There is a spiciness that reminds me of fresh arugula, and the fine effervescence keeps it refreshing.		This is one of the more food-friendly beers I can think of. It is not too heavy nor too light, and it possesses the ability to meld with other flavors and not dominate. It can be quite interesting and satisfying on its own, too. Good French wines can also do that.";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at Capone's on 5/23/09. Served in a shaker pint.		A - Deep, dark coffee brown body with thick, one-finger burnt mocha head that retained fantastically and laced up extremely well.		S - Fresh ground coffee aroma with bittersweet chocolate notes. Some sweet caramel and toffee notes emerge eventually, as well as some subtle earthy hop notes. Simple yet effective, but one of the best coffee stout aromas ever.		T - Wonderful blend of fresh coffee, semi-sweet chocolate and subtle earthy hop notes that gain momentum as the liquid warmed up a bit. Alcohol is virtually undetectable.		M - Thick and luscious body with a smooth, creamy texture and subtle carbonation. Pretty assertive bitter finish with a touch of residual sweetness on the palate. 		S - Possibly the best coffee stout out there. I can't imagine anything topping this phenominal beer. Breakfast Stout is definitely my benchmark for the style.";;;;;;;;;;
"The pour only gives a 1/2 inch of solid tan head, fine with a few large bubbles. Quickly recedes to a variable skim and leaves plenty of lace on the glass. The beer itself is a clear coppery amber.		Aroma is full of grapefruit and tangerine from plenty of American hops. Malt is right up there with the hops, prominently throwing out caramel and just a bit of rye spiciness. Esters are low and alcohol makes itself known, but is not at all boozy or distracting. Overall aroma is very inviting, suggests sweet juicy deliciousness. 		Rye steps right up in the flavor and provides a complimentary bitterness that seamlessly melds with the already massive hop bitterness. Citric aspects of the hops are less prominent in the flavor and the malt provides a complex of toast and caramel. Finishes dry with lingering rye. Hops gradually saturate the tongue as any good IPA should.		Somewhat slick in the mouth, the carbonation fluffs it up a bit and gives an overall impression of creaminess. The rye bites a little but there is no astingence. This is obviously a pretty big, complex and bitter beer and as such can only be so drinkable. Founders has made the best of it and this is a beer which is very inviting if a little overwhelming. Another awesome beer from Founders. A real treat.";;;;;;;;;;
"http://foodbeertravel.wordpress.com/2009/04/03/hoppin-frog-barrel-aged-boris/		Pours a rich deep black color with a 1.5cm light mocha head which rapidly turns into a ring around the top of the beer.		The nostrils are quickly filled with whisky aromas and a little must. This is also accompanied by the nice roasted aromas familiar to BORIS drinkers. A reasonably well balanced profile - not too dominated by the whiskey, but definitely boozy.		Similar on the tongue - some whisky but not at all dominating. A nice alcohol warmth, maybe just a bit too much in the finish. Nice, smooth, roasted flavors - some chocolate, more than I remember in the normal BORIS and just a hint of vanilla in the end. The vanilla and whisky play nicely together in the long finish.		Regular BORIS has the most incredible smooth palate and this follows suit. So silky smooth from the oatmeal. Definitely an interest beer for this alone.		This is a complete sipper. Plenty drinkable, but the alcohol is hitting me a bit too hot as I get through the beer. Also, you've got to drink it slow in order to get the vanilla and whiskey on the finish, which is the best part of the beer for me. Not a problem.		A worthy beer with plenty of its own unique character. By no means my favorite BA RIS, but again - it's in its own category almost. I appreciate the balance and relative subtlety of the whiskey. An excellent beer. Not enough barrel character to let this age for an extended period, I don't think.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle poured into pint glass		Appearance: Coal black with a dark head that shifts to lacing.		Smell: Dark chocolate, dark sweet malts, coffee, bit of a burnt character. 		Taste: Smooth thick black malts, cream, whiskey, oak, and milk. Bitterness hovers of the tasting, but does not overwhelm the other flavors. Ends smooth with a backlash from the alcohol. 		Drinkability: I hate the limited availability of this beer. Goes down smooth and warms the soul.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to vinyljunkie for this. The bottle says ""Red's Rye P.A."" & the abv is listed as 6.6 percent, but I think this is just the most up-to-date version of Red's Rye. 		Pours a hazy, reddish deep copper with a 1-finger sunflower yellow head. Moderate lacing. 		The smell is immediately piney & grapefruity hops, followed by some sweet malty aromas. The taste is sour from the rye & grapefruit, along with some spiciness but no sweet malts in the flavor to speak of. Mouthfeel is smooth, thicker than I expected. 		This is a very drinkable beer. It's full-flavored, and its sour & spicy flavors go really well with peppery food.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance - WOW one of the darkest and viscous beers i have ever seen. To call this motor oil is an understatement. Nice chocolate fluffy head.		Smell - Awesome bitter dark chocolate, roasted malts, hints of vanilla and coffee		Taste - Chocolate, big time. Right up front you get hit with the bitterness which leaves room for the roasted malts and subtle notes of coffee and vanilla to come afterwards. What i like the best is the lingering flavor of melted dark chocolate in your mouth from this.		Mouthfeel - Awesome, coats the mouth and leaves an amazing taste for you to long for more.		Overall - Another fucking amazing Founders stout.";;;;;;;;;;
"Enjoyed this IPA with William Pang (Queens, NY).		This one poured a very hazy orange-gold color, with pretty thin, bubbly head and minimal lacing.		The smell is almost exclusively citrusy grapefruit hop bitterness. There is a faint but noticeable bread-malt smell somewhere in there, but it is overpowered by the hops.		The taste is very interesting. Much of the flavor is of bread, with hints of the citrus/grapefruit hops. Much of the end-taste is the bread.		Medium bodied, but very fluid. Lots of biting hop bitterness and not much carbonation in the mouth.		Good drinkability. Not too heavy, not a ton of alcohol, but a little hoppy to drink extensively.";;;;;;;;;;
"Beer in Can &#8800; Meh		After year's of corporate programming by Bud, Miller, and Coors, I have come to associate beer in cans as being ""meh."" Even when I see craft brews in cans I can't help but think ""meh beer."" But as I sit here sipping a Caldera IPA I am having a cognitive dissonance moment. This beer comes in a can AND it tastes GOOD. Whoa.		Mind = Blown. To review ...		Poured from a 12oz can into a Firestone Walker shaker pint glass.		A: Pours a deep honey color with a good two finger head that sticks around quite awhile before dissipating into a thin layer on top.		S: Smells of citrusy hop goodness.		T: My tongue is braced for hops but wait, what is that? Is that malt? Yes, yes it is! There's a nice malt backbone running through this thing that finished with a good does of citrusy hops. Nicely balanced.		M: A good medium body with just the right amount of carbonation. Bitter goodness lingers on the palate.		D: In one word, very. The balance between the malt and hops is just right.		Overall, I give Caldera IPA a noms and a hat tip for being in a can. :)";;;;;;;;;;
"1 pt. 09 oz. bottle purchased for $4.29 on 6-24-07 at Whole Foods Portland. Contrary to what's listed here on the site, my bottle informs me that this beer contains 5.1 abv. Recipe change? 		Pours a very dark reddish hue. Looks black until you hold it up to the light. Solid 2 inch off-white head leaves free form lacing while making a hasty exit. The aroma is almost exclusively of smoked meats. Like jerky and smoked salmon. More powerful than I had anticipated. But I like it. The taste is the same. Very smoky, and all I can think about is how much I love smoked salmon. This beer brings back memories that have nothing to do with beer. I like that. There is some definite hop bitterness in the middle, and I don't get any sweetness until the very end. Very interesting brew. Love the smoke, but there is something in the aftertaste that I wish would just leave me alone. Something in there just doesn't belong, imo. There is also a slight abrasiveness on the tongue. But this is still a very good beer, and I'd definitely purchase it again if my smoke-tooth starts harassing me again. Can't help but wonder what a touch of this could do for a nice homemade bbq sauce. Or maybe a marinade. Overall, I'm impressed.";;;;;;;;;;
dark amber with a one finger head that doesnt leave a whole lot of lacing. The smell is very sweet caramel and grain. The taste is the same with a hop bitterness. decent mouthfeel and drinkablilty. A pretty standard ESB, not amazing but still pretty solid and easy drinking. Wouldnt buy this regularly but from time to time when im in the mood I would.;;;;;;;;;;
I enjoyed this one, make it a regular. Golden dawn in the glass, the frothy white head exhuded some lovely perfumy hops. With a medium mouthfeel, the beer was easy to drink. Some grainyness peaks out but thankfully it's rather low, and this drinker was rewarded with some crispness, some spiceness, and a lovely perfumy finish. I liked this one.;;;;;;;;;;
"Fellow Beer advocate (Thanks Skuter) brought this to a recent tasting. Review is from notes. 		Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Bruery Tulip glass. 		The beer pours a shiny copper orange, with a golden amber hue, and a thin head that dissipated quickly, leaving a bubble ring that retained throughout. Good amount of lacing. 		Very complex aroma. Caramel is the initial note, followed by oranges. Another smell shows off the notes of vanilla, bourbon, oak, as well as some toast with maple & brown sugar. 		The beer is pretty intense tasting, but mirrors pretty much everything from the nose. No mistaking the maple bourbon vanilla taste on the draw, followed by layers of caramel malt, toast, and brown sugar. This is a sweet beer if you couldn't tell. 		Mouth feel was full, oily, sticky, and lightly carbonated. 		Overall, the age did this beer a lot of justice. Mellowed out some of the sweetness, and any hops faded to just balancing to let the malt profile shine through. Aging also masked the alcohol a bit, and layered the flavors together. Great beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"poured into a St. Bernardus chalice 		a: looks like opaque cranberry juice, a true rose color.		s: wow, raspberries! in my face, yum.		t: this is delicious, light carbonation ushers in a smooth and pleasant raspberry flavor, slightly tart, a little too sweet. There is a hint of malt in there somewhere midway through which prevents it from being a soda rather than a quality brew that it is.		m: light, crisp, and smooth all at once.		d: could drink this all night, though due to it's sweetness its more of a desert beer. A good one to get the ladyfriend who ""hates beer"" to try and thats a good thing.		cant wait to pick it up again.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Dark, near black mahogany in color. The faintest ruby glow when held up to light. Thick, foamy dark brown head with incredbile retention and lacing. Just a beautiful beer all around.		S - Strong aroma of roasted malt, coffee, and alcohol. Surprisingly boozy in the nose. Hints of bittersweet chocolate as well.		T - Faint espresso taste initially and quickly sweetens with notes of chcolate and rasins. A strong, warming alcohol presence throughout the beer. 		M/D - Full bodied and very creamy smooth. Somewhat viscous in the feel as well. A very easy sipping big stout.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: clear golden yellow in color with a 1"" head. Some spotty lacing developed.		Smell: grass and a bit of corn are light and barely detectable by the nose. 		Taste: mild malt profile, soft grass tones, corn, hint of green grape sweetness, and some very mild bitterness. More malt sweetness in this than the typical BMC beer.		Mouthfeel: crisp throughout. Aftertaste is clean. Light in body.		Drinkability: very easy to drink this beer but it is quite mild on the flavor front. A bit better than the usual macro selections and it went pretty well with the spanish food we were eating.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured very dark opaque amber in the glass with a very creamy tan head of sticky lacing.	Aroma is more light coffee than anything else to me.	Mouthfeel is creamy smooth. Sweet malts, dark brown sugar, cream and coffee, vanilla, toffee, then definite alcohol.	The alcohol makes it's presence known immediately and after a couple of nice swallows of this beer, you reallize it has turned into a sipper to be enjoyed over a long time.";;;;;;;;;;
Bottled, received in trade. This is a great single IPA. Pours a nice cantalope type color and the aroma is jumping. The flavor is big, really big for a single. Citrus with tad of malt and nice lightly creamy texture. Dang, I wish Founders had distribution out here, this is good! Got to try their Devil Dancer triple soon!;;;;;;;;;;
Wow! This brew is a must try! Great job, Founders! Poured a very dark brown with a slight reddish tone. Thin, off white head, but very thick and strong. Long lasting, excellent lacing. Not much carbonation. Smelled of strong, roasted, toasted, luscious malt. I loved the smell. Despite the heavy, roasted malt, this is a very smooth, creamy, dreamy brew. Extremely smooth. I can't express that enough. Full bodied, but still light on the tongue and throat. Starts out a little bitter, but finishes smooth and rich with a strong tasting, roasted malt aftertaste that makes you yearn for more and also my pipe (legal tobacco). Warm, rich, relaxing feeling .Would make a great, crisp autumn or winter brew. Extremely drinkable, even with the 8.3% abv. Beers like this are so enjoyable and are what great beer is about. Cheers and enjoy.;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a viscous black with the same glass coating qualities as East End Toaster and Dark Lord. Not much head but a small tan crown. There are some highlights around the glass.		Smell is a very sweet chocolate scent with some hints of coffee. 		Taste is a very creamy chocolate/coffee concoction. Tasty, very similar to FFF's moloko. Surprising considering the higher ABV in this one. I couldn't put this one down as fast because it is a bit thicker in the mouth, but the carbonation is nice and low.		It's between this and Blackout Stout for my new favorite readily available brew. That may be a Gala Apples to Fuji Apples comparison, but you get the point. Try it!";;;;;;;;;;
"Dark blond to orange in color, looking somewhat unclear from the yeast, with a head that is small and not that long-lasting.		Aroma is very sweet and malty, in the sense of caramel and fruit candy. A hoppy herbal presence is noticeable to, as is a trace of yeast. Kind of a dough-like or cookie-like smell, that is slightly pungent in its sweetness. 		Initially, the flavour is less sweet and a bit more sour than the nose. Next, a bitter and roasted moment takes over. The beer finishes slowly and dry and results in a hoppy after-taste, which is still quite sour. A simple taste altogether, but not necessarily lacking. 		Soft carbonation and a fairly light body.		An honest and rather simple beer, but definitely enjoyable.";;;;;;;;;;
"500 mL bottle into an Imperial Pint,		A: Pours a red-brown with a finger of white foam, some lace.		S: Classic British Bitter, caramel and toast, minerals, sulfur.		T: A little more on the hoppier side than most British bitters I've had. Notes of metal and definite minerality. Malt brings flavours of toast and a mild brown sugar.		M: Little too metallic/coppery at times. Medium-bodied, very smooth.		D: A real nice pub ale, it's nice to see another classic British ale here in the US.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a growler into a Cigar City snifter.		It pours a brilliantly clear chestnut brown with some ruby highlights. Bubbles rise to the surface as the carbonation is released but no real head forms. After about 10 seconds the beer looks pretty lifeless in the glass.		The nose is distinctly sweet brandy but not overpowering or boozy as any other brandy barrel beer I've had; it's more subtle and inviting. That's really all I'm picking up but it's really nice.		The taste is really interesting. Much like the nose the brandy is front and center but still restrained in terms of overwhelming the palette. I'm guessing this didn't spend too much time in the barrel. It's sweet with some caramel notes but for the strength it isn't too sweet and with barely an alcohol note. I really enjoyed this beer.		The mouthfeel is my only problem with this beer, it's a bit thin and watery for my liking. The carbonation is on the low side but I'm alright with that due to the style. Drinkability is good for the strength, barely detectable alcohol at 12%. I could easily drink a few snifters of this.";;;;;;;;;;
"slightly hazy peach-amber gold. bright white head that drops quick, but leaves a nice dense lace.		smells earthy, hoppy, but mostly just hoppy.. kinda reminds me of composting branches, but in a good way. wet hop.		tastes of a good balance - nice clean sweet malts on front that balance but don't distract from the last 3/4 - wet hop, more hop, ending with some orangey-hop and hoppy spiciness. very clearly wet hopped, and very clearly very good.		couldn't ask for a better mouthfeel for the style.. nice and thick, but not enough to be distracting. enough carbonation for a good feel and slight spritz, but not overwhelming.		just a touch cloying for drinkability in the strict sense, but i'd be happy to take me time for more of these.";;;;;;;;;;
"Murky brown and ominous in my snifter. Strong aromas of bourbon and oak greet my nose right away. Caramelized booze, sweet malts too.		First sip instantly reminds me this is a scotch. Bourbon and oak charge forward quickly, bringing with them a caramel-y, boozy complexion. Big spike of auxiliary flavors in the middle before the dry finish.		Dark fruit and malts are the centerpiece here, so I was concerned that the boldness of the ancillary barrel flavors would overwhelm things. Fortunately, we're talking about a Founders beer, and they'd never do such a thing.		Medium body, good amount of carbonation. Would love a creamier version, but not sure if it's stylistically possible. Bourbon-aged beers aren't really my thing so drinkability suffers, but objectively it's quite drinkable.		Seriously, the Founders brewmasters are rock stars.";;;;;;;;;;
This beer pours a cloudy orange color with a thin head but it's retention was great. Smell was sweet and malty with a hoppy citrusy edge. The taste was sweet, malty balanced with piney hops, endless aftertaste of grassy and citrusy hops. There was a little too much grapefruit flavor in this beer. A little on the malty side for an IPA but still an excellent beer. Medium body with reasonable carbonation. A very refreshing and drinkable beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"16 bucks for retail, 18 to consume in the bar...a tall order and I think my friend for splitting this one. 		Served room temp and I highly recommend letting this one breath a bit. 		Dark as night pour, this seems a bit thicker than the regular boris, but the lighting and glassware wasn't up to a proper comparison. 		A strong complex roasted coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and bourbon nose.		The taste is much the same. No flavor really takes over, this is amazingly well blended and sinfully delightful. Hops at the finish give this one a lot of dark fruit flavors but the bitter roast never lets it turn overly sweet or fruity. Of course the chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and oak flavors are all very present and solid. 		Very good body here. Just enough carbonation survived the barrel aging. Somewhat thick and chewy.		I'm not sure what else to say. A very very good beer. Is it on par with some of the world's top barrel aged imperial stouts? Well, my score might end up close, but close in this world is a HUGE difference. Get the price down or somewhat add that extra umph and we'll talk again.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Deep black, with a large tan head that subsides in about a minute, leaving behind some staggered lacing.		S: Very rich, showing a great range of smoke and malt aromas, from burnt wood to rye toast to smoked bacon. Like inhaling a campfire, and I mean that in the best way possible.		T: Initial stout-like roasted/chocolate malt profile becomes progressively smokier, with a faint hint of the characteristic smoked meat flavor also being present. Though relatively bitter in the beginning, the malty sweetness comes out as the smoke fades away. Ends on a lightly smoky, somewhat sweet note that lingers around faintly till the next sip.		M: Medium to slightly heavy body with a very mild carbonation. Relatively smooth, albeit slightly slick finish.		O: Delicious. Much more complex than its Weizen brother, with a less assertive barbecue character and more of a noticeable malt presence. Really a perfect beer for this time of year. Thanks a lot to Brandon/pixieskid for bringing this back for me from Bamberg!";;;;;;;;;;
"I know this is supposed to be over the top intense raspberry and they nailed doing that.		Beautiful ruby red with a big creamy white cap, slightly overcarbonated, but slow fading rings of lace.		Pure raspberries with tart funk and hints of vanilla.		Tart front, sweet berry middle with a twang and some funk.		Nice, sweet, dessert beer to share.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: 11.2 oz bottle, small head, no lacing, light straw color, very nervous since called OK Beer. Wondering if this is a generic beer in Poland. 		S: Very sweat smelling, had to make sure it was a beer, and not a malt beverage only.		T/M: Served ice cold, had light body. not much carbonation, very smoth, surprised its not a light beer.		D: Enjoyable throughout, can't taste the alcohol at all, wife enjoyed it as well.";;;;;;;;;;
"A- IT begins with a big head, but after several minutes the head goes completely away. It has a dark clear color		S- The smell is very detailed. The only things that you smell is like a bonfire smell and a sausage smell. When smelling you smell immediately a sausage that's combined with a fire. 		T- The tastes excatly like it smells, It starts with a cooking over a firethat smooth watery taste then goes onto like tasting some meat		M- The mouthfeel is good, it's very smooth and the carbonation goes with the smooth feeling		D- I would have this if i'm in the mood to have a beer like this, but if not, then I wouldn't have it much then";;;;;;;;;;
"A: This beer pours a beautiful, pristine clear lighter copper color with a one finger of sudsy white head. Head recedes moderatly, and leaves nice susy spotty lacing on the glass		S: Nose is sharp with grapefruit citrus hops, piney grassy hops and a touch of the ganga... just saying...		T: Taste is a strong piney, grassy (ganga) up front. touch of honey and the slightest bready flavoring in the middle that makes this beer belnd so well, finish has a touch of floral hop bite that finishes the beer on an amazingly blended note.		M: Lighter side of medium body, mild carbonation, nice slick, oily feel on the tongue.		D: Oh this one you can sit with for a long time. Great taste, great feel, not filling, and is blended well.";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap @ Founders Brewing Company on 4/23/09. 8 oz pour served in a snifter. 		Pours black as an oil slick with a 1/2 finger of frothy burnt mocha colored head that spreads out across the surface. This just flares up beautifully when swirled, leaving a rich cascade of foam and brown oily residues back. Awesome! The delicious smelling stickiness of the maple syrup is the first thing that sticks in the nose but I'm also quite surprised by how much of the fresh smelling coffee and chocolate character of the regular Breakfast Stout is coming through as well. The mix of these two elements just smells fantastic! Digging at bit deeper in the nose, I'm also picking up some light barrel notes of wood and vanilla underneath, that give the nose even a touch more depth. 		The taste quite frankly, is delicious. Crunchy roasted coffee character and a deep undercurrent of chewy chocolate malts, wrapped up in that same slickly sweet (and a touch boozy) taste of maple syrup notes. Really nice balance here with the flavors just intermingling effortlessly. Finishes very sweet with notes of syrup and chocolate just COATING the palate at times. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a huge mouth filling nature that is both creamy and slick at the same time and a feel that just slathers the mouth with flavors. Overall this just flows so easily in the mouth, with the ABV being dangerously hidden. Fantastic. 		Wow. Now this is a Breakfast Stout! Not only do you get coffee but now you also get maple syrup covered chocolate chip pancakes! Seriously, this stuff was just damn tasty, easy as hell to drink for the size, and honestly, I think that I prefer this to the KBS. More please!";;;;;;;;;;
"I pour this Oatmeal-Imperial Stout tonight into a small Thomas Hardy's Ale snifter, just because...and then I realize it's too small and doesn't do the head justice, and pour it into a wider mouthed Belgian chalice. 		Solid black, with a roasty brown head, oatmea meets cocoa powder.		Big, fat, wide and out loud aroma. bitter hops, molasses, chocolate, a trickle of anise...rich and decadent, potent and luxurious, edging into whiskey-ish flavors.		Drinkin' it...there we go, the vastness, the slick, viscous feel, with smooth, roasty oatmeal riding under it...terribly full-flavored, full-bodied, though not as thick as I like an Imperial Stout. Fine as it is, though. Goodness, it's good. 		A well-balanced, multi-layered, drinkable RIS. Tasty. This does a body good on a cold December night. Alcohol doesn't intrude on the enjoyment. 	Gets sharp at times, bright fruit flavor flashes in...but remains a solid Imperial Stout. Delicious stuff. 		Much thanks to BuckeyeNation for providing!";;;;;;;;;;
"22oz bottle poured into a Duvel glass.		A: Jet black. Opaque, no light gets through this bad boy. Descent tan head that dissipates down into a thin ring around the glass. No real lacing to be found. I'd assume with an oatmeal stout, imperial or not, that I would get more head and lacing. 		S: Pretty much what I find to be a standard RIS smell. Dark chocolate, some burnt sugar, dark fruit, but a pleasant oat smell once it warms up. Nothing to complain about here. Almost like an oatmeal cookie, a chocolate raisin oatmeal cookie. 		T: Reminds me of kahlua. Dark chocolate, coffee, and some booze. I'd love to say I taste some oat in there but I'm getting too much booze. Wasn't there when it was cold, but now that it has warmed up I'm getting more booze. 		M: Medium body, fairly viscous. Coats the tongue well. 		D: This drinks very well for an Imperial Stout. Goes down smooth and has lots of good flavors. 		Not my favorite but there is nothing bad about this beer really. I bought this while I was out of state and probably would save my money or buy something else if given the chance again. Not bad but doesn't stand out to me. Good beer but not great. Rather have a Stone IRS any day.";;;;;;;;;;
"i picked a sixer of this guy up at jungle jim's recently along with some imperial stout. this pours black as hell and smells awesome. the mouthfeel is awesome. it is thick as hell and you can feel it expand as soon as you taste it, but it goes down silky smooth. i think this is my new favorite porter. i just need to get some more...		it goes great with Slayer and cold weather";;;;;;;;;;
"(A) Pours a dark honey color with decent, dark orange. Blood orange with red toward to the top. Small head that leaves some lacing.		(S) Grapefruit, pine, citrus rind. Hops. Sweetness.		(T) Has a decent load of hops, but not overly bitter. I know centennial is more of a lower bitter hop. Pretty sweet and malty. It's got a decent foundation of malts that brings in some of the sweeter notes. The grapefruit flavors from the hops are actually also present in the taste. There's a small hint of honey.		(M) Oily but full. Decent body to this beer (medium) but its filling. It's got some weight to it.		(O) Founders makes quality beers. Period. Their lineup is top notch and this beer falls in line to a great ranking of well made beers. Not overly hoppy but not really sweet. Greatly balanced brew.";;;;;;;;;;
"Notes are recent.		This brew is very close to black with red-brown highlights shining through. The tan head that develops is thick and dense, retaining itself well and leaving sticky patches of lacing.	Roasted malts are first on the nose with a boozy, sugary, alcohol sweetness seeiming a little bit fusel and very slightly on the lighter side of the style.	This is a sweet, boozy beer with all kinds of dark fruits, toffee, and chocolate mxing together to give a rum candy sort of flavor with a strong malt backbone. It's almost like dipping a hearty bread into a chocolate rum dip. Hops contribute in moderation for balance, lingering behind all the way through. I can dig this.	The body is on the lighter side of medium and, for all the sweetness, this beer's semi-dryness is dryer than I'd expect. A light alcohol kick finishes out every sip.";;;;;;;;;;
pours out a very hazy and foggy amer-orange colour with a inch thich bone white head. lots of chunky lacing. very interesting nose....fruits and spice...mint and malts. smells wonderful! upon tasting....the first thing to strike the drinker is it's sessionability. flavourful and light bodied...the taste profile is of bready maltiness and yeasty fruitiness, all balanced very nicely. the hopping comes off to me as minty....quite appropriate in the mix. body is again medium to light, with a mineral twang no doubt from the water used. finishes balanced with a lingering metallic singe. quite drinkable and tasty. a fine english ale.;;;;;;;;;;
"Toffee covered wood, wood soaked in whiskey, whiskey aged on oak. Citrus and sharp, summer fruits zest atop the sticky, chewy malt foundation. Aromas of pine and peel. Outstanding balance with the hops jumping in front; just what an IPA should be. Clingy oil that turns to juice, with a particle lace. Their absolutely right, never finishes bitter; at least no bitter than hop heads care for. One of the best IPAs I have had in some time.";;;;;;;;;;
"Picked up a bottle at Cest le Vin. Pours like hot tar into an imperial pint glass.  in head quickly dissipates to a thin film. The film nevers quite goes away, sticking with the beer as long as it lasts, clinging beautifully rich and brown to the sides of the glass. Seems to be almost no carbonation.		Tastes wonderfully nutty, then dark chocolate and burnt coffee flavors creep up on you, before a warming alcohol and bitter coffee finish takes you home. Somewhere in there you also get sideswiped by dark, vinous fruits.		Smells like alcohol, cherries, and charcoal.		Mouth feel is pure velvet but perhaps a bit undercarbonated. A bit too bitter for my tastes too.		Drinkability. I couldnt down more than one or maybe two of these in a sitting, iots too bitter and the alcohol shows through a bit too much, however, this beer leaves me quite happy and I would certainly enjoy another tomorrow, and the next day, and the next";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Extremely dark, almost black in the glass, but some light makes it into the corner of the glass. A very small tan head sits at the surface until the end, leaving a nice lace on the glass for an imperial stout. Looks great, but I've seen some that look much more intimidating. Impressive overall.		S - Sweetness in the form of vanilla and maple syrup, notes of coffee and chocolate, and of course I get a good bit of bourbon. Nowhere near what I smell with KBS, which is a good thing for me, but the alcohol is alive in the aroma here. Extremely pleasant overall.		T - I get a strong maple coffee flavor up front, mixed with some chocolate and fairly notable bourbon flavor (again, nothing close to the bourbon in KBS, so I'm excited for the rest of this one). This is a pretty darn sweet brew, but that didn't stop me from having multiple glasses. I guess I should expect a lot of sweetness in a BS. I preferred this one as it warmed since it was initially served a bit too cold. The flavors really explode and blend nicely to create possibly the best stout I've tasted to date. This brew was somewhat warming, but that doesn't surprise me at all. Taste is off the charts, overall.		M - Not as thick and chewy as I would have guessed (that's a plus), almost thin for an imperial stout, but very smooth. I feel like the carbonation is spot on... There isn't too much at all, which is how I like my heavy stouts.		D - Well I had no issue downing 30 oz. of this delicious beer during happy hour so I'd say it's a heck of a drinkable beer for what it is. You wouldn't want to slam them all night or else you'd probably get sick, and you wallet would be empty (rightfully so). It's a beer that you'll rarely have a chance to try. If you see this on tap, pick up a glass, and don't be hesitant to order another. By the way, I DEFINITELY prefer this to KBS. Much more pleasant and I don't get the liquor and heat that I got from KBS.";;;;;;;;;;
"A friend brought an O'Fallon sampler pack from St. Louis... very nice of her, time to give this one a try! I poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.		The beer is a nice looking hazy amber color, but very little head at all and no retention on what was there. So, mixed bag on the looks.		There's a much stronger smell than I expected, malty caramel dominates but an earthy spiciness comes through too. 		The taste is a little weaker than the smell, but I'm also picking up some hoppiness I missed on the nose. The other flavors are all present too with the rye earthiness coming more to the front than the amber malts. More complex than expected, and really a nice beer.		It's a little thin, but not enough to really take away much from the beer, just not anything to add.		I had an unfiltered wheat from O'Fallon first and found it a little boring. This one is the opposite, very interesting and I'll definitely be looking forward to the second bottle!";;;;;;;;;;
"Bomber enjoyed in a Sierra Nevada Imperial pint glass		A = pours a jet black with a dark brown, two finger head which quickly dissipates leaving minimal lacing		S = smoky malt, chocolate, roasted coffee, nothing overpowering, a near perfect blend of aroma		T = again, smokey malt, chocolate, coffee little bitterness with a little hint of alcohol in the end, 		M = as smooth as silk, thick, only a little carbonation, and not too much burn from the alcohol at 10.5 this can sneak up on you 		D = overall this is phenomenal. A bit bigger and bolder than the BORIS, this is one of my top two or three Russian Imperial Stouts.";;;;;;;;;;
Seems like there is peach on the nose? Nuts on the end. It's smoky on the end for sure, like roasted leaves. A real earthy brew that you can tell is definitely a craft brew. You can tell care has been made with this one. Definitely worth trying. Very well crafted.;;;;;;;;;;
Pours a moderately dark orange amber with a nice single finger head that melts to a pretty sticky lacing.;Aromas are toasted malt and citrus hops.;Taste is a good balance between the sweet toasted amber malts and citrus malts. This beer has warmed somewhat and the flavors have really melted together...there is no fight between sweet and bitter here...nice blending.;;;;;;;;
Pours up with a nice two finger head that lingers and lingers if you let it sit you can see where the larger pockets of air break and leave indentions in the head. An amazing lace clings to the glass from top to bottom. The smell is nice, bright hops, foreward malts, and a nice grapefruity citrus aroma. The taste is also very nice, fruity up front, orange and lemon zest. Some piney notes in the middle, very nice, and a sweet herbal hop kick in the end...even the exhaust is bitter....nice. The mouthfeel was initially, I felt, too water but on second taste it is quite creamy if not a bit undercarbonated. Damn drinkable, and at over 7% abv, maybe a bit dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;
"Okay, this is my first review. Let me start by saying, first, thanks for reading. Second, you need to go find this beer. There's a reason I haven't reviewed a beer yet. I haven't discovered one so unique to bother. Seriously though, I'm not sophisticated enough to differentiate the subtle nuances between the many different styles and many different brewers. I've been a cheap beer drinker all my life until the past few months. You'll never witness me ripping on a 30pack of Red Dog, but recently, my tastes have become a bit more refined. I hesitate say but now it's more about the quality than the quantity. I bought six random (local/Michigan) beers tonight. There were porters and trippels but I saved this particular bottle 'til last. I always pick one that I believe will stand out as my final beer. This was it. However, I had to take a trip BACK to the beer store for more of this TONIGHT. 		I didn't note the pour, color, bouquet or head. What I did note was the terrific initial taste and the pleasureably sweet subsequent aftertaste. Aftertaste is usually a bad word, but with this beer it is the dessert. Reviews compare this beer to Founder's Dirty Bastard but I taste no similarities. For a heavy HEAVY (10.2%) beer, this is a delightfully pleasant and refreshing brew that far surpasses all expectations.";;;;;;;;;;
"2007 rate.		22 oz. bottle. Pours deep brown with a nice caramel head. Great lacing with thousands of tiny bubbles clinging to the glass. Rich aroma of some kind of good coffee and bitter chocolate. An almost vinous note also, which I really love in a big stout. Flavor is heavy, some hops up front, dark fruits, that vinous touch, and creamy and lush in the finish. Very impressive, especially because this is not my favorite style by any stretch. The bottle becomes a little bit heavy and burdensome after time.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into my Duvel tulip at 58 degrees. 		This one is pitch black with a light cocoa colored head. The nose is huge with fresh coffee and dark chocolate. Tons of espresso and rich gooey chocolate on the palate. A hit of hops at the end. Really long finish. The body is big, but not huge. Very smooth, very creamy. Really delicous. I could see trying this for breakfast at some point, too. Will intend on picking up a 4-pack each year - great stuff!";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass	Picked up a 4 pack. I liked this more than I'd thought. I'm not a coffee drinker and yet this coffee beer really tasted good to me. I'll be getting this again, my new favorite coffee stout. 	Look is black with a small brown head.	Smell is yup coffee and sweet chocolate.	Taste is wow complex. There is a lot going on here I get coffee, roasted malts, bitter chocolate, creamy milk chocolate, some dark fruit maybe, and some bitterness just to round things off. A great balance of a lot of flavors.	Feel is creamy and thick.	Drink I could sit and drink this all night long. There are a lot of flavors and yet I didn't get overwhelmed by them.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a clear burned orange with a creamy head that dies somewhat quickly and little to no lacing. Smells like a hop bomb with strong citrus, rind and a tiny bit of floral. Blows away your taste buds with hops and a bite of citrus. The balance isnt as great as it could be but this sure is tasty, especially if you are a hop head. Finishes wonderfully dry and bitter but doesnt linger too long on the tongue. Carbonation is perfect. A very drinkable and delicious IPA....and from a can no less.;;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz. bottle into a tulip...thanks to atsprings for bringing this my way.		This pour surprised me, after having just drank a Founder's Red Rye a few weeks back, I was certainly not expecting such a jet black, opaque beer. The head is generous, fluffy, tan, and well retained. Excellent lacing on the way, too. 		The aroma reveals a biscuity malt backbone with notes of brown sugar, foresty hops, and toffee. The taste blasts off with a huge roast coffee malt note, acrid as hell and lingering for what seems like an eternity. Some smoother milk chocolate and hops blend into the background. Lovin' it. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and viscous, with (again) a huge bitter java bite to the finish. This beer is good, if not very good, but it's a bit much to be able to stomach more than one per setting. Nevertheless, it's one I'll be looking forward to trying again soon.";;;;;;;;;;
"500 ml bottle received from LuckySevens82 and BIF33 - Team Spring.		From the bottle this pours a very dark and clear brown beer with a thick lasting light brown head.		Smell is sweet and fruity with a hint of smoke. Sweetness is malt with a trace of brown sugar and chocolate. Fruit scents are raisin fig and plums. There is a bit of spice in the scent to, mostly ginger, chocolate and pepper.		Taste is sweet and chocolate and smoke with noticeable coffee bitterness in the end. Noticeable trace of acidity in the flavor. Very much a chocolate and coffee flavored beer but there is some fruitiness and cake flavors to this too.		Mouthfeel is milkshake.		A completely enjoyable beer is about all you really have to say about this one. It is very highly rated for good reason. The only reason you might not like this one is that is on the sweet side, if you hate sweeter beers then this probably isn't something you will like.";;;;;;;;;;
"Brown 500ml bottle.		Poured into a Gordon's thistle glass (twice).		Looks a picture, clear, dark terracota with a fine slightly off-white head.		Aroma is sweet and Christmas pudding smelling, caramel and cinnamon come to mind.		Tastes of hops and malted biscuits, fairly bitter, but the fruitiness in the aroma tempers the flavour to produce a very good beer.		The mixture of flavours stay in the mouth, 4.9% isn't heavy, the mouthfeel reflects that.		All in all, a very good beer. I had three pints of this beer with my Christmas dinner in 2006, I don't choose any old beer to have on that day!";;;;;;;;;;
"On nitro-tap at the Founders Brewing Company on 4/23/09. Served in a pint glass. 		Pours a deep, clear cranberry color with a finger of tight pinkish white head that barely budges, just absolutely lathering the sides of the glass with lacing. The aroma is just as advertised, fruity pomegranate with a bit of floral hops and sweetness behind it. Not overly assertive but still pleasant and rich in the nose. 		The taste is similar but a little more forceful this time. Tart pomegranate juice takes center stage, but there is also a nice candied sweetness behind it and a touch of bitterness in the back that gives the profile some extra presence. Finishes lightly tart and sweet. Nice. The mouthfeel overall feels medium bodied but there is smooth and silky nature to this from the nitro that just moves this effortlessly across the palate. Very nice drinkability here. 		Founders has a history of producing great tasting fruit beers and this one continues the trend. The use of the pomegranates in this imparted a crisp tartness and serving it on nitro just kicked the quaffable nature of this into a new gear. Plus it's name is a tribute to Prince. Hey, maybe if Rbus ever comes back, they can rename it Raspberry Beret!";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a deep purple sort of like a red wine color with a one finger pinkish purple head. The head recedes to skim and leaves gobs of lacing up and down the glass. The aroma has the scent of raspberries with a hint of grassiness. The taste starts out with a sweet raspberry taste and then midway through switches to a raspberry tartiness with a hint of booze. The beer was very sweet in nature. The mouthfeel was cabonated and silky. Overall an excellent beer very good taste look and aroma. A very easy drink despite decent abv.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from tap at Capones in Norristown into a tulip glass.		A: A jet black color with no light showing through. Minimal head on the tap pour and minimal glass lacing.		S: Coffee, dark coffee with chocolate and roasty flavors. Some mild sweetness.		T: More of the nose. Dark coffee flavors, sometimes tasting almost burnt, or burnt chars of wood. A nice creamy chocolate flavor stands up next to the coffee with roasted flavors. A bit of sweet fruits, maybe dark cherries with some sweetness. A bit of hops at the finish leads to a creamy but slightly bitter finish. Very nice.		M: Creamy smooth with a bit of alcohol detected. 		D: Good, they go down easily for the abv. Still, you can't pound these all ngiht, but one or two is perfect.		Overall another great beer from Founders. This is not up to par with KBS, but what other stout really is? Not many. Still, this is a great drinkable coffee oatmeal stout that was very enjoyable on tap. Would drink anytime I see it.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Sudsy single finger head with little retention adn scant lacing. Apple cider red with little visible carbonation.		S: Nice hop nose, not itngling but more remiscent of the traditional British style bitter (less the alcohol content)		T: Smooth balance of fruit and floral hops with accents of grass and grain. Malty understatements.		M/D: Smooth and crisp with no residue or film left hegind. Chewy mouthfeel with a creaminess that gets greater as the drink continues.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours dark chocolate brown with a tan fine tan head that lasts quite a while leaving some good lacing. Aroma is predominantly chocolate malts, roast malts and a hint of coffee. Flavour is very good with the aromas coming in to the flavour mix along with some toffee sweetness and some slight graininess of the roasted malts coming through. What impresses me most is that the body is rich and full for a 4.% ABV beer, normally there would be a hole in the palate range but this is spot on, no wateriness or thinness at all. Finally the finish is quite long a pleasant, mainly coffee with a touch of prune in there.;;;;;;;;;;
"Black. Light brown head, not too compact.	At the smell lightly toasted malt, pleasant, points of green hop.	Full and intense taste, dry, watery.	A good toasted maltiness, some cocoa, pleasant to drink.	A good toasted in the afrtaste, a good cooca, even if very short.	After a little warming, some coffee.";;;;;;;;;;
Bottle (courtesy of Hogtownharry): Poured a deep hazy amber color ale with a huge slightly off white foamy head with excellent retention. Aroma of citrus hops is clearly detectable but nice semi-sweet malt presence provides good balance. Taste is also quite strong on citrus hops with nice malt base. Body is above average and I really enjoyed the low filtration level.;;;;;;;;;;
"had both as a 12 oz bottle in a pint glass and on tap in a snifter		it pours an amber color with red highlights. seems very hoppy with stong aftertaste. the bitterness hits just at the end of the sip. the alcohol is warming. thick and syrupy, but it still goes down smooth.";;;;;;;;;;
"A-Pours a hazy honey-amber w/light, fizzy head. Label has illustration of ants pillaging a picnic basket. 	S-Apricot, floral notes, pleasantly sweet. Spice, pepper, faint clove and banana.	T-Banana, apricot, light malt, faint hop bitterness, finish is of faint grapefruit zest and wheat. 	M-Light-to-medium-bodied, light carbonation, and a warm, boozy texture.	D-Had this on tap as well, and it was labeled as an ""imperial saison."" This is a saison a little on steroids, and ABV seems a little higher than normal...not that there's anything wrong with that.";;;;;;;;;;
"Very very black color. Had a wonderful charred bourbon aftertaste that i really liked after the third sip. Once again like the darklord I taste a very dark chocolate like a 72% or higher of coco. I did prefer this beer over the Darklord.	 This is also another beer that i think only one bottle would be my fill since it is so heavy, but i savored it and drank it slow. I wonder what bourbon barrel it was in to get that taste. Maybe a makers mark or a pappy van winkel if we are lucky.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours as dark as any stout i have seen with 1 1/2 fingers of head that quickly works down to a ring around the glass. The smell is of paper and coffee grounds with hints of bourbon, and some dark malts. The flavor is more subdued then i would expect staring with the roasted malts with some vanilla, and working through to the oak chips and a lingering bourbon finish. Good mouthfeel for a stout, and the drinkability it also rather good. I was expecting something a bit more over the top, seeing as this was not anything to extreme, but rather enjoyable.;;;;;;;;;;
Pours a reddish orange with just the slightest head. Still, a pretty beer. Smells of cherry pie filling with a hint of spice, and a tad of maltiness. The taste is of sour cherries, sweet malt, spicy cinnamon, and a hint of almond, probably from cherry pits. Perhaps a little too sweet, but I like the sour cherry flavor, which seems real, not at all artificial tasting. Slightly spicy and relatively crisp in the mouth. Pleasant.;;;;;;;;;;
"note: I had this side by side with the Founders Centennial IPA, so my review may be skewed (I favor the IPA over the Rye PA).		A: Similar to the founders Centennial, with an avg. head. Amber in color with minor lacing.		S: More hop presence than expected. Toasty malts with intense citrus and grapefruit aroma. No yeast smell, very crisp.		T: Does not taste as hoppy as it smells. Rye is not to prominent. Very well balanced with perfect carbonation.		0verall: Easy to drink, very sessionable beer. For the money, I'd stick with the Founders Centennial.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle from Dyan. Thanks!		Burnished gold in the glass with a moderate haze. The first pour leaves me with a small frothy white cap, which in time recedes to a thick collar. It's a hearty looking ale.		Grapefruit is strong on the nose; flesh, peel and zest. There's a touch of orange to it as well, hints of pine, whispers of candy sweetness.		Flavors of grapefruit and pine fill the mouth upon first sip, and they're chased by a light malty sweetness, a touch of solventy alcohol and ultimately a sharp resiny bitterness. It's not an entirely dry beer, even in the finish, though it's not sweet either. Medium in body, it has a pleasant lightness to it for the hefty alcohol content. This is very good, not quite in the upper-eschelon of DIPAs, but highly enjoyable all the same.";;;;;;;;;;
"(A) Pours a hazy yellowish orange. More orange onward the bottom of the glass. Decent small bubbled head that leaves lacing and thins to a covering on the top of the beer.		(S) Sweet malts, residual sugars, and hops make the aroma of this brew. Not overly hoppy in the nose, but the hop presence is there wrapped in sweetness. Some slight citrus and floral notes.		(T) Sweet citrus and hops are the bulk of the taste. Has some light malts and some lemon and orange peel.		(M) Ends with a nice bitter feel. Medium body. Oily but full.		(O) One thing I really like about this beer is it's a pretty straight forward brew. There's not a lot of complexity and it's a solid DIPA. You want a good hoppy beer but with the balance of a great malt foundation, this is a really good beer to reach for.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Dark blend of black and brown....with a very light lacing hugging the glass...head quickly disappeared.		S: Hard to get hints of anything... [could be my slight cold...or not..]		T: malty, nutty, pleasant after taste... 		M: carbonation is present. not a lot to the body. Easy to drink.... 		may add more as it warms.. definitely worth a pick up. Probably one of the better O'Fallon's I've tried.";;;;;;;;;;
"From bottle to Bruges hybrid glass on 2/8/11	I should note that this is my 25th review		A: Molasses in a glass. It's viscous and coats the interior of the glass like few other beers I've seen. A semi-forceful pour offers a 3+ finger head that dissipates without leaving signifigant lacing. It actually looks like a frothy chocolate milkshake.		S: Thie initial nose immediately reminds me of Founders Breakfast Stout - roasty coffee and German chocolate. Upon further investigation, I am able to detect minut traces of alcohol, but more then anything I smell freshly baked ginger snaps right out of the oven.		T: Robust and unsweetened dark chocolate punch me in the mouth. Imagine falling down a dark hole with no floor in sight. That is what this beer is: massive amounts of complex malt melding ever so perfectly with charcoal smoke and alcohol.		M: Your wife ever force feed you one of those Slim Fast shakes? Yeah - this beer is kinda like that. Velvety thick and rich with luxurious carbonation. You could have one of these bad boys for lunch and walk away content.		O: Just an awesome, complex and rewarding brew. I really wish this Imperial Stout got as much recognition, distribution and push as their Breakfast Stout, as this may be the unsung hero of their lineup. One of the better RIS's I've had.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Jet Black, large mocha colored head, reduced quickly. Average lacing. This is the darkest porter I have seen.		S: Roasted caramel, dark chocolate, espresso malted milk balls.		T: Dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans. Great balanced bitterness at the end.		M: Average carbonation, again, the bitterness at the end is phenomenal. Great body.		D: Is this a porter or a stout? Best porter, and most balanced, i've ever had, PERIOD.";;;;;;;;;;
"2009 12oz. bottle served into a Gulden Draak tulip		Pours burnt orange/copper with a one-finger sized porcelain-white head. The beer laces well, with sudsy patterns. Attractive and well-executed.		The nose opens with a grenade blast of hops. Devil Dancer doesn't really smell floral like many heavily hopped beers do. The hop bouquet is more resiny and oily. This beer smells bitter, if that makes any sense. Its almost as if I'm experiencing the strength of a normal IPA's hop flavors on the tongue... only I'm experiencing that level of strength purely through my nose. This beer was also less boozy than I expected, but the alcohol is present nonetheless.		The word ""hopbomb"" doesn't do Devil Dancer justice. Not quite. This beer is sublimely hoppy. Mango and pineapple are strong initially -- the fruit digs a hole into the center of my tongue, deposits a bomb in said hole, and then explodes it. After the first few sips you get used to it and the resiny hop flavors start to take over. This is a bitter, oily, gooey tasting hop experience. Its like lapping up the distilled juice of a blended-together garden. Eventually, as the beer warms, the generous malt bill asserts itself. It features a light kind of sweetness... its candy in nature (bubblegum?) but is not cloying or cringe-inducing, ever. The more the beer opens up, the more I am reminded of American Barleywine flavors. This is like a Sierra Nevada Bigfoot hopped up on HGH (Hop Growth Hormone, obv.) in many respects. It should be noted that this beer is not boozy tasting, but each swallow carries along with it some alcohol fusels that go straight to your nose. Considering that this beer was dry-hopped for a brain-pretzeling 26 consecutive days, I am surprised that the aftertaste is not harsher than it is. The lingering aftertaste is pleasantly like some kind of hop vapor -- flavorful but light. 		Devil Dancer is pretty thick in the mouth. The carbonation might be less than desired; the feel gets pretty syrupy at times. But it is never unpleasantly thick, and it sort of contributes to the beer's uniqueness. Drinkability is tough to score. The beer is disappearing really quickly despite its strong flavors and 12% ABV. At the same time, both of those factors make for a beer that you aren't going to want to have multiples of in one night (not often, anyway). 		Founders Devil Dancer is insane. Twenty-six consecutive days of dry-hopping? Devilish indeed were the people who conceived of this beer. I'll be interested to see what cellaring will do to this beer; to see how good of an American Barelywine this beer will turn out to be. You can't go wrong with drinking Devil Dancer when its in its fresh, young, ""Triple IPA"" stage, either. $20 is certainly a lot for only a 4-pack of 12oz. bottles, but Devil Dancer is absolutely worth trying once. If you're like me then once won't be nearly enough.";;;;;;;;;;
"Vintage date of 11/3/03 on the label. Pours a bright amber color with a medium white head, lots of carbonation. Aroma is bright and fruity, light hops and caramel sweetness. More alcohol elements apparent as it warms.		Taste is more of the same: Fruity sweetness, faint tang of hops and a light-roasted malt. Hints of oranges, banana and mango with just the lightest dryness in the finish. As it warms, the fruit character yields to a nice rounded maltiness. Barely a trace of alcohol in the taste.		Second pour was murky with the rest of the lees. Taste was altered slightly, more bready, yeasty, fruity highlights more subdued. Almost a different beer altogether. Had to knock off points on the appearance for that.		Mouthfeel is medium with a soft oily nature but very smooth. Lots of carbonation keeps it lively, never heavy on the palate with just a bit of acidic bite. Thanks to meathookjones for sharing this one.";;;;;;;;;;
"A- Comes in a cool bottle with a hop vine design at the bottom of the neck. I poured this into my mug fairly hard and the head didn't disappoint! It is thick, creamy, a tad off white and the retention is marvelous! The color is a mainly clear orange hued amber. The lacing is very sticky and clings very well to the side of my mug. One of the best looking beers that I've come across!		S- The aroma is a well balanced one. I can smell the sweet, smooth malts, followed by the typical fruit esters that should be found in an English Pale Ale and just a slight nuttiness. There is a fresh, leafy hop bitterness detectable on the finish as well.		T- Very nice flavors of malt, that are exceptionally smooth, with the floral/fruity notes give this a bit of a kick. There is some mild mineral astringency mixed in before the hops do their job on the sides of my palate.		M- The carbonation is very mild in this medium bodied brew. It is buttery smooth and gives my palate a very good coating, going from sweet to herbal to bitter. Very good!		D- This is my favorite category of beer and wish this is how our standard beers were made. I would love this one to be available on tap where I am. It's lower alcohol level makes this one easy to enjoy as a session beer and would go well with salty fried pub food! I will definitely buy this beer again! Just short of Fuller's London Pride but a strong second!";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at brewery tasting room, Richland, WA, 5.19.11.		Deep gold body, multiple streams of small bubbles rising to surface. Half finger white head, some lacing retained. Taste is grapefruit pith (!) big pine resin notes leading to a quite bitter finish, re Simcoe, Cascade, Citra hop profile. Nose mirrors taste, hard to pick up much malt. Medium mouthfeel, little effervescence. Nicely done.";;;;;;;;;;
"Wow!	One of the best looking beers I've ever seen. Dark chestnut colored with some georgous red hues. Looks like the color of a fine piece of furnature. Creamy almond colored head that rises to 2"" and falls and holds at 1/4"". Lot's of thick sticky lacing clings to the glass.	For all that's happening with the appearance there is little going on in the aroma. Big whiff of roasted malts. It's certainly not bad, but I was expecting more.	To me the aroma should be a prelude to the taste. In this particular beer the aroma is like test driving a Chevorlet Cavalier to buy a Corvette. This beer taste amazing! Lot's of roasted malts. Peat. Nutty. Raisins. Whole wheat toast. Mildly fruity. It's kind of like the alcohol gives it the fruity flavor and an ever so slight bite at the end. This beer makes me crave malts like I usually crave hops.	The mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and CREAMY!	Despite the huge flavors and high abv I could easily session this beer and I would probably pay for it later...but it wouldn't matter, b/c this beer is that good!!	I received this in a trade and whoever traded it to me. THANK YOU!!! Wanna trade for a sixer?";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: clear golden yellow in color with a 1"" head that lasts a bit. Some light lacing paints the glass.		Smell: bits of floral bitterness is detectable.		Taste: caramel, nice balancing bitterness with some soft grapefruit citrus tones. Basic mild IPA here that is not in your face.		Mouthfeel: lightly crisp throughout. A bit of dryness arrives at the finish. Medium bodied. Short aftertaste as the flavors linger softly in the mouth.		Drinkability: easy to quaff IPA. One of those beers you get in a plastic cup to walk around town with.";;;;;;;;;;
A - Dark reddish brown. Huge head that stays for a while. ;S - I could smell the hops and malt while its sitting two feet away from me. Smells like sweet mandarin oranges and tangerine. ;T - Wow. This tastes like tangerine and rye. This is really flavorful. I love this beer. I feel like I'm drinking a spicy orangina with bitterness and yeast. ;M - Medium;D - very drinkable.;;;;;;
"Look: the beer pours a reddish-brown color with a nice light-brown head. 	Smell: Heavy roasted malts, licorice, toffee	Taste: Roasted malts, toffee, medicinal, some light licorice. Aftertaste is sweet, dry and aromatic	Mouthfeel: Medium body, soft carbonation. 	Overall: Nice brew";;;;;;;;;;
"6.5% ABV per the label. 		Pours a crystal clear dark brown with a 2 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thin clumps and streaks of lace cling to the glass on the drink down. Smell is all about the smoke but in a more subtle was than the Marzen: smoked meat, smoked cheese, campfire, etc. I am getting a slight whiff of malt if I search for it. Taste is also of the aforementioned smoked items with a nice sweet malt that supports everything. The smoke flavors aren't as powerful in the aftertaste compared to the Marzen, leaving more of a sweet and subtle roast flavor. This beer has a nice mouthfeel with a solid body and a crisp amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a very good rauchbier and hands down my favorite of the Schlenkerla beers I have tried thus far.";;;;;;;;;;
"Big thanks to Skye1024! 		I'm not sure of the vintage, but I am sure this bottle has held up just fine. Smell is big grains, heavily roasted malt, candi sugar, definitely getting some chocolate too. There is also still some hop presence here, surprisingly.		Taste opens up into smoked and roasted malts, then sort of rolls into molasses, piney hop bite, and lingering peppery rye. Very grainy and nutty. Carbonation is quite high. Despite so many ""dark"" flavors, I think a lower amount of carbonation would weigh this baby down. 		Quite enjoyable, but its hard to put a finger on whats really going on here. I guess the only style that can sum this up is the generic term ""rye beer"". Its an excellent one for sure.";;;;;;;;;;
"Golden yellow, with a nice fluffy white head that leaves some great lacing. Filmy after a while, which is a shame. Otherwise very nice looking.		Light grain organics on the nose, with a pleasant grassy freshness. Even a light hint of smooth sweetness, perhaps vanilla, which is odd, but not unpleasant. Not huge, but not bad.		Pretty tame palate, with some fluctuating hops bitterness that never reaches a crescendo. Some malty grain notes, but not huge. The end is a little yeasty which leaves a gritty finish in the mouth. Otherwise, it's a decent, if uninteresting flavour profile.		Hey, it's a drinkable beer. I just wonder if this is simply a ""plonk some branding on the beer"" beer. Relatively light, and while not terrible exciting, it goes down well enough.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Nice white, foamy head with steady retention and good lacing		S: A combination of lemon/citrus and an eathy hay quality; pleasant but quite subtle		T: A smoky meatiness is most prevalent and that blends nicely with the earthy guality and subtle citrus from the hops		F: Very even balanced		D: A great beer for grilling; this is a nice, slightly smokey lager";;;;;;;;;;
"A_Pitch black with a thick dark brown head that quickly dissipates. Thick lacing.		S_Smells roasty with chocolate,espresso,and alcohol.		T_Roasted malt and dark fruits up front. Bitter dark chocolate and espresso round it out. Very tasty. Alcohol very well hidden with a gentle warming effect.		M_Very thick and very,very cream. Usually dont get too worked up about mouthfeel but this is great.		D_Buy a case.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle in to my favorite Stone Ruination pint glass.		Pours bitch black that cannot be seen through even when it is held directly up to a light source. No head to speak of, just a thin dark brown lacing at the top.		Very strong coffee beans up front. I would even say that it smells more along the lines of espresso beans. Dark chocolate, and alcohol phenols stand out significantly as well. I can detect breaded malts of course the bourbon barreled aroma in the undertone. Doesn't stand out as much as I thought it would, but it is still a great smelling brew.		The taste falls right in line with the nose. Pungent coffee bean flavors will attack the pallet right away. Dark chocolate, vanilla, and breaded malts come through as well. The bourbon bourbon barrel flavor makes the alcohol phenols stand out almost as significantly as the coffee bean flavors. 		Mouthfeel is full-bodied, smooth and complex. There's a lot going on with this beer, enough so that I couldn't completely figure it out.		An excellent offering by Founders. I was expecting this beer to be highly overrated, but I feel that it lives up to the hype.";;;;;;;;;;
"Looks good, strong head, a little lighter colored head then expected, khaki.		Can smell the oatmeal, pleasent, doesn't smell hot, a light coffee note that is quality, malts on the roasty end of the spectrum.		great balance of the sweet and roasted flavors here, at least in my opinion, which tends to go more roasty then most people do i find. There is just a hint of harsh flavors from the roasty notes and carbination and alcohol, but for me it's very appealing, in the same way a cup of black coffee or well done steak is, just a light brash note that adds complexity and depth. Semi-sweet baking chocolate has a similar impression with me.		 The Oatmeal adds nicely to the flavor and to the mouthfeel where it does most of it's work, but while this comes off a bit thinner....i'll say 4/10 overall for the style...the carbination is up and the oatmeal kick in to keep it an enjoyable pallette experience.";;;;;;;;;;
"On-tap 1/27/2010 at Track 84 in Warwick, RI, served in a tulip glass.		A: The beer is a light reddish brown color, with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.		S: The aroma is mostly of smoked meat and caramelized malts with a faint touch of hops.		T: The taste is very smoky as you would expect with a strong meaty flavor that isn't overdone. Then a mild caramel sweetness comes in with a mild but complementary hops presence. The malt character is hearty and the smokiness tones down a bit allowing everything to balance more after it sits for a few minutes. The after-taste is slightly smoky and slightly sweet.		M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.		D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, yet another nice smoked beer from this brewer to drink for a while.";;;;;;;;;;
A- Appearance poured a nice amber with a full white head that fell quickly leaving lacing down the glass.;;S- Amarillo hops citrus ;;T- Wonderful balance of hops and belgian malt exceptional taste;;M- Smooth and crisp very clean finish of hops and citrus.;;D- Could have more than one or two of these.;;
"A: A very cloudy orange pour. Decent white head with just a hint of orange in it. Retention is so-so and almost no lacing.		S: Very subtle smell. Just a touch of pumpkin and nutmeg. Not much else that I can discern.		T: Nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice. Maybe just a hint of pumpkin. Sweet at the start and in the middle and just a brief hit of some earthy bitterness in the aftertaste. Pumpkin spice flavor is very long lasting, sticks to your mouth. All flavors are pretty mild as this is a low ABV beer.		M: Very thin but not watery at least. All smells and flavors are pretty mild. A good departure from the high ABV pumpkin monsters (Pumking for example). 		O: Interesting take on a pumpkin ale. Once of the mildest I've ever had, it's almost hard to discern the flavors sometimes. Wish it was a little stronger but it accomplishes what it came to do. Well balanced spices with the pumpkin and nothing is too dominating.";;;;;;;;;;
"appearance: dark red complexion and looked liked a cherry fruit beer as expected		smell: tart cherries		taste: low bitterness, sublt sour and nice cherry flavor. A well done cherry beer. No tmuch of a sour as expected though.		mouthfeel: light bodied		drinkability: well done fruit beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Sampled in November		A-Black,opaque appearance with a tan head. Good head retention. 		S-Initial coffee aroma followed by some roast malt. I picked up a hint of vanilla. No hop aroma.		T-Initially malty sweet, with a big up-front java flavor. Malt backbone comes through along with moderate bitterness. No hop flavor.		M-Medium body with low-med carbonation. Minimal warming.		D-Great beer and smooth...A bit too much coffee for my taste, but still a good drinker...";;;;;;;;;;
"I'm always amazed whenever I go to my local small-town supermarket and find this beer getting shelf space. My local market only carries about 15-20 brands of beer, macros included, but it's a lucky stroke for me that the buyer is knowledgeable enough to give this fine beer it's props, even in the Texas boonies.		This beer bills itself as the daddy of all pilsners, and the research says that it's pretty much a true statement. Although I'm not impressed with their website, it does provide some rudimentary historical background on how the beer was developed. 		The beer itself is wonderful. It indeed has all of the traditional characteristics that define a great pilsner beer. It pours crisp and clean, leaving a wealth of head that sticks to the glass all the way down. It has a good, hoppy aroma with no trace of bitterness. It has a fresh taste, smooth and relaxed. Like most pilsners, it doesn't have a ton of mouthpresence, but that's entirely consistent with the style. It finishes well, although a bit dry for my tastes. This particular bottle left with me with a slightly bitter aftertaste, but I don't know how long this sixpack was on the shelf, so I might chalk that up to age.		I'm not sold that this is the greatest pilsner on Earth, but it is one helluva good beer. It's one of the classic beers for it's type, and I recommend that you grab one if you haven't tried it before. Lay a couple of these down with some marinated chicken or some nice pork chops. Your guests will thank you.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from the bottle into my large Dogfish head snifter, fresh as can be, patiently reserved in line for a simple four pack to be consumed and reviewed. This is my milestone, and my 300th review on Beer Advocate. Much thanks to the brothers. Onward...		Off the visible pour it is borderline motor oil black out of the bottle but not quite... Head is very solid and cocoa light brown I would say with a good solid retention. After falling for LOTS of time (having consumed two of these in one sitting) it maintains a collar that will not go away. The body is my personal favorite walnut brown, but just wants to hint... I mean just hint at black midnight. Based on all that... she looks great. Decent lacing giving up to leopardy like spotting. 		Bouquet is jarring for this style and a big surprise considering the abv in front. DRY husky grain, faint dried out wood, not a wood smell that I could pinpoint (regardless that they come from American oak bourbon barrels). The sense is something tannic is coming even though you DO NOT smell tannins. It strangely (dare I say it) feels like fresh cut timber or assembled oak furniture. Very dense and full of body. Some simple cheap store bought coffee also. Extremely unique smelling and balance.. really nice. When I smell these aromas, they feel like I am tasting and drinking this beverage as it is. Cellar like smell with a dampness that isn't ruined, musty, no not BAD.. just down there.... DANK DANK DANK!!!! Chocolate milk bent on the nose. No sense of heat or big booze coming for this large ABV.		Taste is well, stealing something from the vocabulary.. exceptional when factoring the mouthfeel. Almost silky but SOoooo... easy palatable and borderline wet in feel. Big milk chocolate front but not turning into a sweet chocolate bomb. Sweetness hints, faint standard coffee, but extremely balanced profile. Slight tannins in the mouth pushing forward and puckering, it is dry I will give it that but tolerable. What is not here for me on taste just for the record is tobacco and fruit. Vanilla for me personally .... creeps up unknowingly then takes over. It's not apparent at first but then makes it's presence known latter while drinking. This is not a beer that feels particularly like whiskey either. It's not bourbon feeling at all (I have a bias being a bourbon drinker) but that is a good thing this is truly a great beer, and the highly masked abv boozy quality that you would think came from this is completely hidden. This should be considered beer forward and not whiskey. The chocolate and vanilla mix gets into almost ice cream territory, with much fun. This could pass easily as a dessert beer for sure but works also on its own.. So stupidly easy drinking, creamy, almost dark chocolate, balanced soft tannins, woody, FROTHY, too much to desire.		Overall some serious intense craft and quality while drinking this. This is magic right here, and some great feel. Just for the record the high abv on this is dangerous cause I feel like I could just pound these back like no tomorrow. Part of that stupid drinkability, besides all this sophistication and time put into it, is that it feels like a kids morning chocolate breakfast drink, such as Carnation Instant Breakfast drink. Does this beer taste like bourbon... NO. Emphatically no giving way to a good magic that is masking the alcohol.. It is just a great tasting beer and very unique and done superbly.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Pours a clear copper color with a bubbly ecru head that retains well and leaves a few shards of lacing		Smell: Grainy malt aroma that is slightly nutty with a dash of butter		Taste: Immediately strikes the tongue with a fruity (plums and berries) and nutty malt taste; shortly thereafter, the grainy malt flavors that were in the aroma appear as well; after the swallow, the RIngwood yeast imparts its characteristic touch of diacetyl; the finish was sour and a touch rough but the earthy English hops added a nice touch		Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation; slightly slick from the diacetyl		Drinkability: Complex and interesting and, while it would not rank among my favorites, it is unusual enough to seek out; congrats to the brewery for creating this singular sipper		Thanks, palma, for the opportunity";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at Capone's on 4/17/10. 		A - Jet black with the slightest hint of deep burgundy around the bottom edges and a slim yet creamy burnt mocha head that reduced to a delicate web of lacing.		S - Complex RIS nose, though not as overwhelming on the coffee or chocolate, which is typical of the style. Instead, the olfactory is greeted with licorice and molasses notes, oatmeal, leather and earthy hop notes. A waft of alcohol also pushes its way through.		T - Neither coffee nor chocolate really stand out in the flavor, either. However, there is a hint of tangy dark fruit, sweet tobacco and licorice notes, and a subtle alcohol presence. Finishes with a hint of earthy hops and semi-sweet chocolate, which add a nice dose of bitterness to the mix.		M - Full-bodied with a smooth, oily yet chewy texture. Plenty of alcohol warmth on the palate, although it doesn't overwhelm at all. finishes with moderate hop bitterness on the palate. 		D - B.O.R.I.S. is definitely one of the best of its kind in America, no doubt about it. Goes down quite easily for being an almost 10% monster! However, I will say that I enjoyed this slightly more from the bottle than on tap, although I never reviewed the bottle version. I'll have to get on that... pronto!";;;;;;;;;;
"Gambrinus, ABV: 5.0%.	500 ml bottle, 15.90 SEK at Systembolaget.		I had this beer once about a year ago. At the time I loved Czech Pilseners and I thought this was one of the best I've ever had. Let's see if it's as good as I remember!		A: It pours golden (with hints of copper), with a thick, white, foamy head. Lovely.		S: The aroma is malty with notes of butterscotch, bread and citrus. It doesn't smell like hay and brewery in the same way as an Urquell, but my feeling is definitely Czech.		T: Soft, very balanced, tastes of toffee and bread. Medium bitterness (and a body to match), nothing is extreme here, just pleasant. A very elegant, and robust lager.		M: Real smooth. Filling, yet it's very drinkable, and a somewhat dry finish.		O: I sure have widened my beer taste over the year, but a great Czech Pils is never wrong. This is still one of my favourites - it doesn't get much better for this kind of money. I'll drink this on its own, or with meats, sausages, or a sturdy sandwich.";;;;;;;;;;
"16.9 oz brown bottle with the foil on the neck and a nice label. Clear freshness dating wich is always nice to see. 		The beer pours a very dark brown with a tan head.		The nose is of roasted malt, smoke and bit of chocolate. 		The initial taste is of roasted malts and coffee. The beer also has a bit of dark bread taste to it. A bit of earthiness emerges later. Apple flavor immerges even later. Lots going on for lager! Only downside is a bit of sourness that creeps in and it seems out of place. 		The mouth is decent and the carbonation is a bit subdued which works well with this beer. Easy enough beer to drink, interesting enough to be seasonable and would be good to pair with some sharp cheeses. 		This is much better than the other beer (the Pilsner) I had from this brewery. $1.09 from Sals in Elmhurst, IL.";;;;;;;;;;
"Brewed with Pale, Munich, and Belgian Aromatic malts; Centennial, Cascade, and Spaltz hops.	OG=1.048, ABV=4.7%, 22 IBU.		Drank on tap at Pikes BC in Seattle, WA.		Slightly hazy orange brew forms a thin white head with OK retention and lacing. Aroma is very crisp and fresh with citric hops and well-balanced amount of malts. Taste is much the same...fresh, bright citric hops, smooth malts, a lingering honey-like sweetness and assertively fruity. The finish is smooth with caramel notes and an even bitterness throughout. Real nicely done, easy to drink. Clean, crisp wet mouthfeel with a medium-light body.";;;;;;;;;;
"Served on tap at Growlers in Gaithersburg, MD. Beer is black to dark brown. The head is small brown bubbles that form at the edge of the glass, leaving minimal lacing on the sides of the vessel. Cannot tell the carbonation due to the opaque color of the beer, it looks good.		Aroma is dominated by roast, no a lot of hop character despite the description of the beer.		Flavor is nice. Some sweetness, roast in the back of the mouth, finishes completely. Mouthfeel is medium body and drinkability is high. I would order this beer again. The description of the beer from the brewer, 		""A very dark, almost black, top fermented brew made with highly roasted chocolate and black malts. This stout is full bodied and lightly hopped.""		I didn't get much in the way of hop character and I would classify this as medium bodied, but overall a good beer and a decent stout. Good job.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Pours a hazy light brown with a finger of quickly dissipating off white head.		S - Aroma is mostly grain (wheat primarily), a faint bit of coriander and pepper. Overall pretty nice.		T - Taste is quite nice. Yeast, wheat, a bit of citrus and some spice. A really bright tasting Belgian ale.		M - Good mouthfeel, light and crisp.		D - This is a lighter tasting, very refreshing beer; highly drinkable. Enjoyed this more than I expected to.";;;;;;;;;;
"A huge thanks to JohnQVegas for hooking me up with a number of these. Going to put a couple down, but just have to tear into one now. 		Off a medium pour a bubbly tan head grows to two-fingers, and perfectly fills the SA specialty glass. As the bubbles pop furious the froth fades and leaves some random curly spines of lace behind. Jet black in color with no light penetration, although some slight ruby hues are barely discernible at the very edge. 		Aroma involves a good mix of sweet and smoky notes with black licorice, cherry wood, a slight earthy mustiness, some cotton candy and a distant hoppiness which all evolve into a near perfect mix.		Oh so smooth and pleasant on the palate like liquid candy at first, then some more sublime smokiness, some big malts, black coffee, and some nuanced bitterness which infuses itself at random points. A slight alcohol heat lingers in the throat, and it goes down almost a true medium, but just a little extra weight pulls it toward the full-bodied end of the spectrum. Creamy and not too filling either, as I could have a couple and move onto an IPA or something and not feel too weighted down.		As always with beers of such high ratings you initially wonder if they're a bit over-hyped. I can honestly say this one is an A+, and is the best Imperial Porter I've every tried. From the first smell to the last taste, what a wonderful experience. Future Best of BA we have here folks.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz. bottle poured a black cherry with a small tan head that leaves a few specks of lace around the glass.		 Smell - like sweet fruit and candy.	 Taste - very malty, mild bitterness with a bit of yeast and alcohol in the finish.	 Feel - medium bodied with some alcohol dryness.	 Drinkability - pretty easy to drink by itself or with a meal but not one I would drink more than a couple of.";;;;;;;;;;
"A delightfully hoppy rye beer, both in aroma and taste. Brilliant reddish amber - in a good way - with pleasant levels of head and carbonation.		Aroma has tropical fruits with resin highlights, while the flavours balance hops against a stiff caramelized rye & malt backbone. The alcohol is dangerously hidden, with little to no burn - just a delightfully bitter finish.		An excellent beer!";;;;;;;;;;
"Served from a bottle into a 20 ounce wine gobblet.		Appearance: This has a very nice pale off amber coloration with loads of particles suspended in the beer. The head is an inch and a half of white foamy goodness. Looks great as the lace plays on the side of the glass.		Smell: A combination of floral, grassy, citrusy goodness.		Taste: A very strong taste of hops and yeasty goodness on the intial taste. The finish is citrus and breadyness.		Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a very drinkable smooth pale ale. Not alot of carbonation to be had. I think I will pour myself another.";;;;;;;;;;
Pint Glass;;Poured a nice thick head and gradually declined. Smells quite strong as far as alchohol content. Bit of a robust barley in it. Tastes like butterscotch flavors. But wow is this beer a kick. It's a nice strong scotch ale thats light on the stomach but a smack in the face. Yeah thats right you're drunk. Very nice scotch I find it to be right up there with warped speed scotch ale.;;;;;;;;
"Custom six pack. Bottling date: 4/25/11.		A & S: very strong aroma; hoppy [(1st) most prominent], caramel, sweet malts, buttery bread (2nd). Up to mid knuckle in frothy light tan colored head. The beer is a good/natural maple syrup color. Good dissipation rate on the head and the lacing clings to the glass very well.		T & M: Moderately complex beer, with a wide range of differences in taste during different times in the sip. At first there is this nice bready taste, a bit spicy, with this sweet malty background to the beer. Then there is a pleasant switch to a finish that is quite bitter, citrus hoppy, and a bit of mint. Medium bodied, and shape carbonation. Very drinkable		O: I thought this beer was pretty awesome for its style. I was suprised that I rated it this high, but I can't find any reason not to. Overall better then Bells Rye beer Golden Rye I think, and even though I havent had Sky High Rye from Arcadia I cant see myself liking that more then this.";;;;;;;;;;
Nice slightly murky amber color. Very appealing foamy head with lots of sticky lacing left behind.;;Aroma is a blend of fruity hops with a slight belgian yeast scent.;;Taste is excellent - leans more towards the IPA side with the bitter & fruity hops dominating the palate.;;Easy to drink and nicely carbonated - I would definitely drink this again.;;;;
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Thanks to thabigmp for this one.		A: Darker orange with a slight red tint. Half finger slightly off white head with OK retention and decent lacing.		S: Mainly citrus and pine hops, with neither dominating. Good caramel malt backbone. Has some slight grassy/earthy/rye notes.		T: Nice caramel upfront. Piney, citrusy hops in the middle with slight earthy notes and a touch of rye. The rye really comes through in the end and aftertaste. Not real bitter or spicy. Well balanced all the way through.		M: Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Not real crisp or dry or refreshing.		O: Im not a big rye fan but this is a pretty good one. What else would I expect from founders? Drinkable and good but I wouldnt buy it for my tastes.";;;;;;;;;;
"appearance - Black in color, small head here. 		smell - Malt, chocolate, and bourbon. 		taste - Coffee, chocolate, malt, some bourbon present. Cocco		mouthfeel - Medium body. 		drinkability - Decent beer, was a nice sipper I should say. Would try again .";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle poured into Founders pint glass.		A - Dark brown black with a small tan head.		S - Sweet dark roasted malt with some coffee and milk chocolate notes.		T - Strong roasted malt flavor at first, followed by a slight chocolate bitterness. The flavor is quite satisfying, although not very complex. Leaves a lingering roasted malt coffee taste on the tongue.		M - Smooth and creamy. Medium-full body with low carbonation.		D - Delicious and filling. Nice roasted malt flavors. This beer is highly drinkable and well balanced for a porter.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz. bottled poured into pint glass.		A: Very nice brownish color, not too light. Some floaters. A moderate head with nice lacing.		S: Some of the usual hop notes, citrus, pine, etc. A few breadlike and yeast notes come through.		T: Extremely well balanced. A nice progression of flavors from hop oils and pine up front to solid maltiness in the middle to moderate bitterness at the end. No flavors stand out because everything is melded together so well.		M: Nice body, appropriate level of carbonation and just the right amount of puckering from the bitterness.		D: If I ever found this on tap somewhere I could see drinking my fair share of these.		An all around excellent American IPA. There are some that I like a little better, but Founder's Centennial is a great beer. I am glad this beer will now be available in NJ, I will definitely be buying more of it.";;;;;;;;;;
"This is such a uniquely delicious beer. I've not had many rye beers and have also not been terribly impressed with blended style beers but this is great. 		It pours a golden red with good head that hung around for a little bit, and was back with a few quick swirls. The aroma is a powerful kick of citrus and grapefruit, can't say enough about the aroma that carries through the whole pint. The bitter component is very well balanced with the body of the beer, great finish a little spice to add to the powerful aroma. 		This beer is well worth checking out especially if you typically gravitate to hoppy brews.";;;;;;;;;;
"22oz poured into Glass		A- Black as night, slight tan head but barely anything at all, with a bit of lacing		S- First smell is chocolate with coffee malts, lots of dry roast smell in this		T- Almost same as smell, dark roasted malts with slight coffee oatmeal, little sweetness and bitterness, nothing to overbearing.		M-full body, low carbonation, silky smooth		T- Great beer, not like other imperial stouts, definitely will be having this again.";;;;;;;;;;
"Got the last two four packs at JR liquor in Stevens Point tonight. I have been reading about this beer and needed to try it. The color is a dark amber with hop cone in it. The hop cone is a nice touch and was even small enough to emerge from the bottle into the glass. Nice. There was a three finger head that slowly receeded to a cap on the beer. Lots of lacing as well. 		The smell was good, very descriptive of the taste which was very good. A little sweet but not as syrupy as some DIPAs. I liked that. The mouthfeel was great with a little alcohol burn. I the drinkability was also good, however, I feel like this could get me hammered! All in all a great beer.";;;;;;;;;;
This one ocmes off the tap a hazy peach color with no head. The nise is a nice pungent citrus and pine hop that smells really nice. The taste is full of nice cirtus and pine hop balances with a touch of caramel sweetness. The feel was moderate at best, so a bit thin, but expected. The beer is overall well crafted and easily drinkable. I really like it.;;;;;;;;;;
"Received during our summer beer exchange at work... This was my pick so let's get to reviewing!		Appearance: Pours into a tulip with a beautiful rich mahogany ruby color and about 2 fingers of tan head that recedes way too quickly. It definitely sounds carbonated from two feet away, and the color of this beer is frickin' fantastic!		Smell: This beer smells delicious. Right off the bat, I pick up notes of raisins, grapes, cherries, oats, and a bit of biscuity malts and a wee bit of peat as well. There are some caramel and vanilla notes as well, but as you'll notice from my first three scents, this is a very sweet smelling brew. Not cloyingly so, but it smells like a scotch ale should and that gets good marks in my book.		Taste: This is beer provides for a very interesting mlange of flavors. Definitely picking up the sweeter notes from the cherries and raisins. Can get a lot more of the biscuit and toasted malts that were in the nose. And I also get a little bit more of the peat that I picked up at the beginning. It's not enough to make me think of any comparisons to Scottish whiskeys, but it's enough that I can see the influence.		Mouthfeel: A past reviewer described this beer as chewy, and I can't think of a more apt descriptor than that. The first few sips almost coat the tongue, and invite the imbiber to gnaw on the different flavors offered up therein. The aftertaste is almost as good if not better than the start because of how smoothly this brew makes its way down to your stomach. It's like molasses syrup that just begs you to take another sip.		Drinkability: The higher ABV of this brew is certainly present, but this is more than made up for by the overall mouthfeel and drinkability of this concoction. Founders has done a remarkable job capturing the Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy style, and I will most assuredly be drinking more of this from time to time.";;;;;;;;;;
"Reviewed with Speedwayjim.		Appearance: Jet black with 1 finger of chocolate colored head, motor oil thick, the head dissipates rather quickly. 		Smell: Roasted dark chocolate and coffee.		Taste: Opens with a rich dark chocolate and roasted coffee. Strong malt backbone as the two flavors revolve around as the bourbon shows it face at the finish with a breif hint of licorice and vanilla.		Mouthfeel: Medium Bodied, medium carbonation and smooth throughout.		Drinkability: I would definitely have this again and I would definitely recommend this to those who enjoy the Breakfast stout but better, maltier and richer in flavor.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to DarthKostrizer for letting get a piece of this amazing treat. 	Pitch black. Rich, oily, glass coating viscosity. Amazing foamy light brown head with the best retention I've ever seen on a beer. It lasts pretty much forever if you move the glass which inevitable. 		Very nice nose full of chocolate brownie, light coffe and maple syrup. 		Flavor is stupid good. Amazing balance, very easy to drink. Lovely smoky-maple, rich but not overly sweet chocolate brownie or more like a flourless chocolate cake and nice balanced coffee notes make up the flavor characteristics. 		The mouthfeel has a wonderful velvetty and creamy viscosity that's coats the palate perfectly. Full bodied with low carbonation. 		Overall it's one beer that absolutely lives up to the hype. A very well made stout I'd love to get some more of. Can't wait to try it again.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a moderate brown with small creamy head.		The smell contains dominant notes of whiskey. I wish I knew more about whiskey so maybe I could identify the barrels they used. The taste is extremely smoky, and the whiskey taste is very strong. This beer has some intense flavors. This beer reminds of drinking whiskey and smoking a cigar. Pretty pleasant sensations. Extremley smoky.		We'll see if this taste gets old or not, but overall this is a very interesting beer.";;;;;;;;;;
Very nice looking stout. Thick black color with a creamy dark tan head. The nose has some rich fruity malts, chocolate and sweet oats. The taste is a bit more complex. Lots of big sweet flavors with a good helping of subtle hops. Full body goes down well. A nice stout from Stoudt's.;;;;;;;;;;
Picked up a single at Abe's Cold Beer for $3 a couple months back. Poured pitch black with a tall light brown head. Man, this is pretty bitter. It's also a little more drinkable, which I also like from the big stouts. The beer tastes like extra thick dark chocolate cake, like flourless cake. There's a also a slightly tangy citrus bitterness, that while you can feel, struggles to overcome the massive dark malts on your tongue. Overall a fine RIS and certainly worth my three buck.;;;;;;;;;;
"I am floored by this beer every time I have it. Big flavor, unique mouthfeel ... great stuff.		Reddish brown color with the body carrying a fine haze. Excellent head retention.		The aroma gives you what you would expect - hops and rye ... they unite beautifully to make a nice piny/floral scent that hints at spiciness (as in rye spiciness, not nutmeg spiciness).		Huge bitterness on the tongue and pleasant dryness in the back of the throat. Taking big sips of this beer is quite a sensation. The spiciness might even make my send signals to my brain of the sourness of a pickle or mustard. I certainly wouldn't call this beer sour, but it makes you dream of the salty/sour elements of a Reuben sandwich.		It is an awesome hop-bomb that I could drink all day, any time of the year.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Mahogany with a deep, burnt orange hue. Active carbonation. Loose tan head with fair retention. Collar throughout. No lace.		Smell: Booming, massive, amazing aroma of wood smoke and cured meat. Thick, sweet, slightly tangy malt comes to the fore as the smoke clears. If everything smelled like this, the world would be a better place.		Taste/Mouthfeel: In a word, fantastic. The mouthfeel is pretty light, but still manages to be a bit chewy. Starts with a sweet mouthful of malt, with perhaps a hint of unsweetened chocolate. This, not surprisingly, is soon overtaken by a dee-licious flavor of smoked meat and fragrant, sweet wood smoke. Finish intermingles flavors into a mouthwatering mouthful of Carolina honey-smoked ribmeat. Slight bitterness lingers.		Drinkability: Perfect--if you're in the mood for a smoky flavor. Probably a bit much as a session, but light, huge flavor, great mouthfeel and so, so satisfying. A meal and a drink beside a nice fire--in a glass.		Note: I also sampled their marzen. While slightly lighter and a bit less sweet overall, the two taste so similar I saw no reason to review it. Either will do nicely.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance:		 My Glencairn tasting glass was a perfect fit for this job. I pulled the cap off this heavy ale and was greeted with a slight wisp of carbonation gasses. On the pour I went slowly and was left with a thin creamy head. When I hold my glass up to the light there is an array of deep brown and ruby-plum like colors that are pristine and clear. On the viscosity check I gave a generous swirl and noticed a healthy amount of legs sliding down my glass walls ever so slowly.		Aroma:		Wow, this is a huge punch in the face from the bourbon barrel. Initially all I can get is a huge amount of booze and oak from the barrel but as I let this warm up a little bit a load of caramel soaked raisins and burnt brown sugar are pushing through. I am having a hard time trying to pull out any Belgian notes but hey, the barrel is strong on the nose in this one. In the back end some fig flavors are rounding it out and even a slight pipe tobacco aroma.		Taste:		I have to admit this is one of the most interesting variations I have ever had for the style, but I like it! Right off the start there is a huge kick from the bourbon but it is so much more complex than that. Vanilla, plums, figs, and bready malt is huge in the base. Smooth and warming on the palate and is reminding me of banana foster with some toasted marshmallow. I can see how some people might find this to be a little too sweet for their palate but this is right up my alley on this cold night. In the finish, a hint of bubblegum is poking through which is definitely a component of that Belgian yeast.		Drinkability:		Overall this was one killer barley wine! The only thing Im a little upset about is that this was my only bottle. This is a true sipping ale, and I must admit Im glad that I lit a fire right before I started this one because they seem to go hand in hand on a cold snowy night like tonight. If you come across this one or have the opportunity to trade for it by all means go for it, because not only is it a limited release, it is fantastic for the style. Well until next time.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Doesn't reveal anything different from many other wheat beers, hazy gold body, several inches of head after a carefree pour into appropriate glassware.		Smell: Peaches. Very impressive, but still a little fake smelling, the wheat is also present, in the background. Like a summer fruit beer should.		Taste: A nice balance between the this beers two parents, peach and wheat. The peach is not overdone, yet not subtle, easily drinkable. The wheat provides a nice graininess. I like it a lot, if only it weren't 50 degrees in April here.		Mouthfeel: Very smooth, carbonation reveals itelf only on the swallow. not bad.		Drinkability: I may have to get a 6 pack and save it for when it is 95 degrees and 95% humidity outside.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Pours an amber-brown iced-tea color with hazy appearance and a creamy one finger tan head that quickly dissipates with scant lacing. 	S: Malt overload with sweetness of caramel	T: Sweet malt with caramel, hint of chocolate and dark fruit. Alcohol presence lends a nice warmth. Ever so slight bitter finish as it warms.	M: Chewy medium-full bodied with mild carbonation.	O: Very enjoyable beer that is packed full of flavor. Will definitely drink again.";;;;;;;;;;
"At Pizzeria Paradiso yesterday.		As with all incarnations of the Breakfast Stout, this one's a stunner. Jet black, large creamy head that lasts for what seems to be an eternity, leaving tons of lace. On the nose, it's gorgeous, with a ton of chocolate and coffee. Not too sweet, and the coffee character is fantastic. On the palate, it opens up with a ton of chocolate and coffee, with the chocolate being more prominent than out of the bottle. The combination is just delectable. Some oatmeal flavor is present, adding to the wholesomeness of this beer. Medium bodied with an excellent finish with espresso and dark chocolate characteristics, it's awesome. The nitro-pour is a little disappointing, though - the first few sips are incredibly creamy, but as I wait for the beer to warm up, it turns to being a little flat and just a little watery. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed my glass, and I wasn't leaving immediately, I'd have had another.";;;;;;;;;;
"Strong looking dark beer with nice lasting white head, black opaque and formidable looking.		Malty smell of roasted barley and rye, and nice smooth anticipating smell		Taste has a strong malt start, hops minimal, rye finish makes it very dry. Malt front gives it coffee, toffee and some chocolate overtones, seems somewhere between and ale and a dark lager, excellent balance. Finish is clean and lingering with dry aftertones.		Mouthfeel is smooth, easy, very drinkable, no noticable alcohol. A black session beer for sure.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a beutiful golden yellow color, with a fluffy white head that blossoms above the top of my brewery stein. Nice retention and lacing as well. The aroma opens bready, and finishes with a flowery hop character. The flavor explodes on the tounge a perfectly subtle balance of hops and malt, with an incredible stoney finsh. This is exactly what beer this color should taste like. Perfect after a long hot day and exactly what beer this color should taste like. With a nice creamy finish and delicous aftertaste I could drink this all night.;;;;;;;;;;
"Sampled at the 2010 Stout tasting in a Orval Chalice.		22oz bottle.		Mahogany black with a very light brown head, nose has a ton of oatmeal and malt.		Taste is very good (way better than the Dark Lord I just had)., It's rich and smoother and very mellow. It's super easy to drink for such a big RIS. It's light on the sweetness and really sharp. Awesome beer that's very well balanced.";;;;;;;;;;
"A--This one pours with as much head as you want, and probably more. I must have had a little too much force behind mine because there was a fluffy white head up 3/4 of the glass. And it takes forever to recede, had to wait a bit just to pour the rest of the 12 oz's. Golden yellow with carbonation bubbles racing quickly to the top. Tons of lacing.		S--Subtle mix of citrus and earthy hops with some banana and clove mixed in.		T--I don't know...this one just kind of tastes empty. It is not unpleasant by any means, but it is almost as if I'm drinking an air bubble. Gonna let this warm up for a few minutes....okay, now things are getting petter. Clean hop taste with almost no bitterness to follow. Pretty good, awesome with a pizza.		M--Nothing of note...maybe a little carbonation sting on the throat but pretty much par for the style		D--Great for a session, the hop burps come quickly and are just as tasty as the beer. Could put back the 4 pack of this very easily. This might be a great introduction to craft beer, but not something I would pursue.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured to a two fingered head with big bubbles in the center of the glass. IPA itself was a almost yellow with brownish hints. Head was offwhite in color. Lots of lacing. Left some nice rings with every swallow. As soon as I opened the bottle I could smell grapefruit. Very citrusy smelling. Also some alcohol smell. Pine was also evident. Smelled great. Tasted citrusy, also strong pine. Had a nice bitter aftertaste. Aftertaste hung around your mouth for a while. Felt a little thick in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. After three swallows, I could feel the effect of the alcohol. My stomach got warm. It felt like I had a shot of booze. Ill buy these again. I just think you would have to be very carefull. It tastes so good you just want to guzzle it. Good brew at one at a time.;;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle shared by the other Matt recently. This beer was a huge, huge surprise. Beer is yellow and hazy with a big white head that leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Beer is heavily carbonated.		Aroma is bready and sweet, smells like a nice light tripel.		Beer is light in body, approaching medium. Lots of carbonation on the mouth. The lead off flavor is the Belgian pale malt character, it's not sweet but the mark of the beer is present here. The midpalate is mostly fruits and some esters along with a stronger yeast character. Once we realized the ABV on this beer, my respect went up considerably. This is a highly drinkable nearly 11% beer. The alcohol is completely masked by the fragile complexity of the beer. It would be quite easy to make this beer be too hot. I would drink it again.";;;;;;;;;;
Very dark in colour, approaching opaque with a deep ruby tinge. The smell was a mixture of very sweet pale malts and the stronger, richer, darker malts. There was also a subtle fruitiness. The taste was also defined by the mixture of malts, a sweetness imparted by the paler malts mixed with a slight roastiness/bitterness from the darker malts. Full bodied and full flavoured, this beer reminds me most of Black Sheep Riggwelter. If you like one you should like the other.;;;;;;;;;;
"Apperance: A pale/ golden yellow body with a thick, creamy white head.		Smell: Slight floral hops with a nice amount of bread smell followed by grains and malty sweetness.		Taste/Mouthfeel: An extremely clean taste. A distinct, but not overpowering, hop flavor followed by a perfect malty sweetness. One of my favorite beers. The mouthful was light and clean.		Drinkability: One of the most drinkable beers I've had. The smooth, clean taste without the overpowering hops make it easy to finish a few.		Overall: One of my favorite beers. The malty sweetness and smell are the highlights of the beer. Wish it was on tap around me.";;;;;;;;;;
This was an amazing beer. Might be my favorit of all time. It had a dark rich color with a slight smokey smell along with hints of cofee.;;Don't remember a head to mention on this beer. The nice smooth tast with a nice back ground aspects of oak from the wisky barles and maple syrup.;;The most mentionable thing about this beer is the residule sugar left coating the glass after done drinking it.;;This beer is well worth the trip to Grand Rapids.;;;;
This pours jet black with a dark brown head, probably the darkest head I've seen, that has varied for me between two fingers and almost nothing. It leaves a bit of lacing, especially if the head starts out big. On the nose it's a huge hit of bitter chocolate, sweet malts, and some espresso underneath. In the mouth it's a huge, thick body, tons of bittersweet chocolate, some hop and chocolate bitterness at the back of the tongue, some prickly carbonation that lingers forever and ever, amen. It starts out quite sweet but finishes nice and bitter, maybe just a touch of pleasant heat, totally fantastic. It's thick and huge, more of an end-of-session or with-dinner beer for me, but plenty good. One of my favorites, rivaling FBS in my book. I'd love to do a side by side.;;;;;;;;;;
"Big, brown German style bottle, capped. Pours out a hay-brown with a smaller size white head. Smell is light but Hefe like. Malt and some citrus smells come through. Not much carbonation but enough to maintain the head.		Taste is well, exactly what I thought, and I mean that in a good way. Banana, citrus, malt and some grass notes come through. I also pick up something bread-like as well. Light in body but not in taste. 		A little sweeter than I like. My personal preference is a drier style ending. Again, I nit pick. I feel this is well made and very easy drinking. Do pick this up and enjoy this summer.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz. bottle poured into my DFH signature glass. Received in a trade from idrinkgas. Thanks man!		A- Pitch black with thin wisps of tan head. Considering its such a small head, it has decent retention and lacing, leaving a rim of foam around the top of the beer.		S- Wow, incredibly complex aromas. Coffee, chocolate, bitter roasted malts, boozy bourbon notes, some creamy vanilla. Very nice.		T- Again, wow. Starts boozy with recognizable bourbon flavors with some oakiness and vanilla. Finishes with some bitter coffee and chocolate notes and a warming alcohol. 		M- Rich and creamy without being too syrupy. Would've liked a tad more carbonation, but this is near spot on.		D- Well, considering this tastes almost as much of whiskey as it does of beer, and has the ABV to prove it, you'd think it would be low. Well, it isn't. This stuff is phenomenal, and although it is a sipper, I can sip this pretty quickly.		One of the most hyped beers I've had the opportunity to try, and this doesn't disappoint. Nearly perfect on every level.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to krisandajt for this trade offering.		Pure black in color with some nice creamy foam which is dark tan in color.		Cream, chocolate and oats fill the nose. Mouth watering.		Tons of malt, nice hop bite as well. Chocolate, some cream and cola as well. Solid, well rounded flavor.		Silky smooth full body. There is some prickly carbonation though too. Dry finish.		Drinks phenomenally. Great all around RIS. Recommended.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours out a medium golden color with a nice amount of carbonation that stays with you for a little bit. Smell consisted of some nice malt tones and some spicy hops, then some buttery tones show up from the ringwood yeast. Taste was alright actually. Some slighty bitter malts show up in the beginning and then ends with some spicy hops. Finished somewhat the same was the taste. The mouthfeel was more on the light side I would say, but on a summer day, this would fit the bill for sure. A good beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"Very deep, very dark polished wood chesnut with a huge and retentive brownish reddish head.		Smells of light fruit, caramel malt, and a little bit of roast Schwarzy grain. Pretty tame.		Tastes very much like it smells. The fruit is big. Not the fruit of a spoiled beer, but still very ripe and not at all tart or juicy. This moves into a sharp peng of caramel in the middle that quickly gives way to burnt, dark grain that gives off a very schwarzy finish. The hops are light and spicy and linger for ages.		Picked up a 4 pack of 16.9 ozers for less than seven bucks. I'd say I got my money's worth. Maybe not quite what I was expecting from a beer from Okocim, but worthwhile.";;;;;;;;;;
"Big thanks to BrewCzar for pointing me in this direction with my ISO: Under the Radar brews, and even more thanks for sending one my way.		This pours nearly black with brown/ruby highlights when held up to the light. The head is fizzy at first, like a cola, but dies down into a resilient full crown. Very nice lacing.		Smell is very light in the whiskey note, which is nice to not have it beat you in the face every time. Smoke, tobacco, some light chocolate, and vanilla, but that may be a product of the whiskey.		Taste is very very good, just the right amount of whiskey. When I have a barrel aged beer, I like when the barrel flavor compliments, not overtakes the characteristics of the base beer, and in this case, you have an already good base with O'Fallon smoke, with some just a little more than subtle hints of whiskey. This is really great, and goes down so easy.		Mouth is thin to medium, which is unfortunate because I think a little more body could have elevated this into the stratosphere. It works and I can't really deduct points because it is to style, but my thoughts none the less.		Wow, this is excellent. Very rarely will I trade for a beer more than once, but this may be the exception. Thanks again BrewCzar, if your other offerings are anywhere near this one, you and I may have some more business to take care of.";;;;;;;;;;
"Into the pint glass you go...alright, here we go:		A - Super dark, if not black then really darn close. Nice head, not over-bearing...looks good		S - Chocolate and malt...nice		T - Phenomenal - Chocolate, coffee, vanilla - tastes really good		M - thick and creamy - perfect		D - A couple would be nice, then you're done		Overall fantastic brew...";;;;;;;;;;
Its apperance is kind of thick for an IPA. It had a great hop aroma smell and this beer has a great taste. What a beer. Full flavored with hops and it hits you quick. I could have drank a few more of them but i didn't have time. I like this beer a lot and it's slowly moving up my list of top double IPA's. I would definitly try this one if your a hop head like me.;;;;;;;;;;
"Serving from a 12 oz. bottle.		A vigorous pour produces a small tan colored head, but that is to be expected for this style. The head disappears almost immediately, but also to be expected. Color is almost an opaque dark ginger brown .. very dark. Nose is incredible with many mixed fruit aspects, including plums and apricots. Very sweet smelling, with some hint of the alcohol in the nose. First sip is like tasting ambrosia; wonderful fruit maltiness, with a hint of piney hops. The flavor is HUGE, and the alcohol presence is notable. The finish is sweet to the last drop, with no lingering after taste. Mouth feel is so full its almost 'chewy'. This is a perfect Winter Warmer, dessert beer, or excellent finish to a session.		Well done, Founders!	Prost!";;;;;;;;;;
"The always dangerous Breakfast Stout. Had a plenty, reviewed a nary. Finally I get around to it.		Beautiful black body, tan/mocha head two fingers high, sticky lacing. Totally opaque.		Nutty, burnt sugars, coffee aroma. Really pounds you with a earthy woodsiness, and the smoke from a dead ember. Just awesome.		Flavor is so heavily smoky, and thick with oily nuts, like brazil nuts and walnut. Bitter finish, but not overly done, in fact it is so balanced it may be the most sneakily flavorful stout I've ever had.		Sticky, viscous oily feel, thick and slick. Very heavy. And did I mention sticky? The one sticky shortcoming to this beer.		One of the finest stouts around. Period. Highly drinkable due to it not racking you over the head with a sack full of quarters and bitterness. The flavor, while substantial, is balanced and even. A masterful work.";;;;;;;;;;
"100th review!	Picked up a sixer on my visit to St. Louis over Easter holiday 2007. 		12 oz. bottle into a pint glass produces a golden, hazy orange brew with an ample amount of off-white head that leaves thick lacing. Aroma? Pot. What's next? No but seriously, this thing reeks of the stickiest of the icky, along with some caramel malts, citrus, and spice. Very good so far.		Taste doesn't disappoint, but isn't as fantastic as the appearance/aroma. Some earthy notes paired with big hops, grapefruit, and bread. Mouthfeel is good; well carbonated and crisp with a decent hoppy finish to let you know shit is in effect. 	Definitely drinkable, appealing, and tasty. Get ahold of this one if you can.";;;;;;;;;;
Stouts double ops;;S not overly strong sweet pineapple / grapefruit peel / some pine smells;;A light amber clean looking mild hop haze fluffy head disappears into a light white coating over the beer;;T bitter at the front grapefruit peel citrus ends extremely dry not a malt to be found hop burps occured a pleasant experience alcohol not intruding on this dipa kinda one sided or simple still good;;M thin very gulpable good drinker slow or fast;;D Great very thin and hoppy a good beer
"Shared this with a friend last night. Poured into snifter type glass to maximize nose.		A- poured slightly warmed, really nice black as night with a minimal size coffee colored head		S- Wow!! Amazing!! One of the best smelling stouts I've ever had..roasty, chocolate, sweet oaky vanilla...coffee!		T- Double Amazing...chocolate, coffee, vanilla, bourbon notes, slightly bitter finish, alcohol warms nicely after swallowing...wonderful!		M- heavier stout that feels great with lighter carbonation.		This is probably one of the best stouts i've ever had..a great sipper!! Only problem with this beer is it's availability, but well worth the price tag!!!";;;;;;;;;;
"Did a side-by-side comparison to the regular BORIS and I enjoyed the Royale hands down.		A: Single fingered cocoa brown soapy head that displayed little retention and only some lacing atop this black bodied brew.		S: Sweeter than the regular. Was able to detect molasses and loads of milk chocolate, but was happy to notice the earthy undertones were still present.		T: Not only is the beer a bit sweeter than the original, but the whiskey flavors added a new dimension to the brew. I also found the added vanilla was great and truly lifted this to one of my favorite RIS.		M: Heavy, slight burn from the booze, well carbonated.		O: Not perfect, but very tasty.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Poured a jet black with huge carbonation and rich brown head, much carbonation		S: Milk, booze, roasted malts and cocoa		T: It looked so good I did not want to drink it but damn it, i did. Immediate milk sweetness, creme and booze sting with roasted malts, tad cocoa and even hints of an oat 		M: Rich, nice feel and a booze sting		D: Very good representation in my book.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - very dark, opaque. tan coffee roasted head. Very stout like. I like it.		S - Not overwhelming tho obviously there. sweet, but not syrupy sweet. Chocolate, roasted coffee. Smells like you want to spend Sunday morning in bed.		T - much like the smell. coffee, chocolate, that oatmeal stout thing. so very good not overpowering in any way. 		M - smooth, not too much carbonation. Not a huge aftertaste and so you need and want to keep sipping more.		D - so easy to drink. i may need to find more. I had high expectations for this beer which scared me but this beer did not let me down. very good brew and highly recommended. This is going to be good any time of the day. This is just not a breakfast beer! This is the beer I've been looking for this season";;;;;;;;;;
Deuce to frosty tulip. Looks excellent. Deep in color and low in carbonation. Bouquet is equally as good. Hops and citrus. Taste is hoptastic. If you're a hophead, you'll love this beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and high abv is pleasantly noticeable. Overall, an excellent beer, but at $15.99+tax for a deuce, it's a special occasions brew.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into my New Holland Pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy reddish brown with a light tan head of two fingers. Head drops, leaving a wisp of foam and some lacing.		Aromas of pink grapefruit hops, spicy caramel malt background.		Flavors of spicy rye malt with an overbite of firm bitterness from citric hops, emphasis on pink grapefruit and grapefruit zest. finish is long with bitter grapefruit lingering.		Mouthfeel is medium with a mouthcoating hop bitterness and a good level of carbonation.		Overall a fantastic brew. Hops overwhelm the rye component a little, but overall a good match.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - pours a caramel color without much of a head		S - the nose consists of stick caramel malts, vanilla, and bourbon all mixed together nicely		T - Loads of caramel malts up front. Up next is a nice pop of vanilla from the barrel aged treatment. Whiskey rounds out the palate with more vanilla and some charred oak. These flavors are all very well integrated into the beer and form a really nice tasting beer.		M - full bodied, a little sticky and somewhat dry on the finish		D - awesome barleywine here. The whiskey is really well integrated into the profile and makes for a very enjoyable brew. Recommended if you can get your hands one some, one of the better barleywines I have ever tried.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured into a weizen glass (all I had) with a great golden straw coloring and a white head. Laced minimally down the glass. Some toastiness in the aroma along with the hops. Similar taste to the aroma with the straw flavors being more prominent. Feel was slightly oliy with a light body. Great drinking session beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a deep, dark brown out of 12oz bottle with a twisty. Three-finger tan head is glorious--great retention, slightly receding into a topography of foamy, creamy pockets. 		The rye, some other grain, toasty malt, a hint of hops, and black cherry comprise the nose. The flavor also contains these components, with dry hops and grain really asserting themselves, followed by a sweeter, smoky, black cherry finish.		The mouth is medium-bodied with great carbonation. It is fairly complex, being slightly sweet and creamy, yet also dry at the same time. It is quite drinkable. Very good overall.";;;;;;;;;;
"the taproom was BUZZING when i went in around 5.00 p.m. today, i had to fight to request the growler (didn't already have one to be filled). this gave me time, however, to pick up a couple regional publications on the counter.		anyway, i rushed home, cut a camembert round and poured a little less than a pint's worth. it's a pretty pour, rich milk chocolate brown turning lighter towards the top. good head retention, some lacing.		chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, malted grain on the nose. nothing else i can find but it's nice.		taste is smooth and definitely mild. chocolate, roasted nuts, a little biscuit and grain contribute to a slight but pleasant bitter finish.		a little thin on the mouth, especially away from the head. carbonation is decent but this is an area of the beer that could be improved upon.		drinkability is super! obviously, with 3% ABV this is a strong session candidate that is not too filling, but could be a ""meal in itself.""		kudos yazoo for your quick start and solid offerings!";;;;;;;;;;
The first experience of this beer was when I poured it into the glass was the light beigh foam that dissapated quickly. The color was of a light honey. Mouthfeel - light and flavorful. Taste - light wheaty and hoppy with a light and friuty aroma. This would be Belgium's answer to American mainstream ales.;;;;;;;;;;
"A rather assertive hop attack that is surprisingly drinkable around a not so assertive body, and a nicely integrated alcohol level.		Presentation: 22 oz brown capped bottle. Label pivoting around the image of a standing/hopping frog holding a jar of beer. On a first distant look the label is forgivable, and given its sad craftsmanship it deserves some kudos for that. But if one pays any kind of minimal attention this is another terribly design label with at least 4 different fonts in an awful array with even worse blending and color effects. It's so ugly that it is almost cute. Luckily not all craft brewers take this care with their branding... Side paragraphs offer a general description of the brew, and intent. Lacks any bottling or freshness date (Although for whatever is worth this bottle was taken right of the case as it was distributed today to DC). Notes Alc. by Vol. (8.2%), IBUs (168), FG (26), and OG (84). Served in a tulip glass. 		A - Deep amber pour, remotely hazy if at all, nice creamy head with good retention, a nice surface memory and lacing.		S - Richly hoppy... It sure is not shy, but it is not an extremely assertive brew. Grapefruit, pineapple, citrus, with malty caramel. Nice and cogent.		T - Firmly hoppy with an initial flavor that only bursts with a rich bitterness as it hits the end of the palate. Hold by a nice and subtle malty sweetness, the citrus and pineapple touches prevail with a persistent presence. 		M - Mouthfeel is medium even medium-light at points, with adequate carbonation. For such a supposedly hoppy brew a somewhat lighter, and yet solid body makes it have an unusual and very efficient flow. 		D - Dangerously quaffable. It does not show the high alcohol of other DIPAs but it is not shy either and it offers a deceptively drinkable profile for those attracted to hoppy brews.		Notes: Hmmm, all in all this is a pretty nice hoppy brew. It is not the wild brew that some would have one believe, but it is very solid. Also, this may have rocked my world a year or two ago? But if, like it seems to be the case, one builds up quite the tolerance and taste for hops maybe it is me that feels it far more gentle in the palate than what this typically is for others? All in all this is quite a recommendable brew for hop lovers with only one big, albeit forgivable, flaw, its disastrous brand design.";;;;;;;;;;
On tap at The Big Hunt in Washington, DC. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a cloudy yellow golden color with a thick white head and a ton of lacing on the glass. Aroma is very strong pine and grapefruit. The taste starts off malty, then immediately followed by a burst of intense, but nice bitter hops with a strong pine flavor to it. A malty and citrusy sweetness lingers throughout the session. The ABV is well-hidden. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Decent carbonation. I really enjoyed this DIPA especially on tap.;;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle pulled from my fridge poured into a tulip. no freshness date. bottle was filled much higher than your average bottle, about 1/2 inch from the top.		pours out nearly black, but reveals some ruby red when held to the light. big fluffy 2 fingers of biege head off the pour that faded to a thick, foamy, retentive layer and towards the end to a ring. big bubbles. not much lacing to speak of.		not a whole lot of aroma to speak of. fruity esters, a little roasted malt, some chalky bakers chocolate. more is noticable as it opens up and warms.		i enjoy the taste much more than the aroma would have suggested. a nice roasted malt blends very well with some dark fruits, bakers chocolate and a touch of coffee. a little caramel noticable. just a touch of an herbal hop towards the back, finishes with a chocolate roasted slight bitterness. 		too overcarbonated for my liking, the big bubbles in the appearence should have been an indication to that. it detracts from the beer a little. however, the medium body is just right for the style. chalky at times.		overall, this is a nice, easy drinking porter. sessionable. not a whole lot going on, but what is there is spot on and tasty. i would definatly drink this again if offered, i wouldnt necessarily seek it out again however.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Dogfish snifter.		A - midnight black with the consistency of Castrol motor oil. Thick, creamy head the color of milk chocolate. Ton of lacing on the glass.		S - burnt coffee, espresso, and dark chocolate pouring out of this one. Hard to find any hop presence due to the overwhelming nature of the coffee.		T - bitter chocolate and fresh ground espresso roast. Some malty and toffee with a wonderfully long chocolate finish. Not all all boozy at 8+%.		M - full bodied, mild carbonation, extremely well balanced and drinkable. 		O - this is what a coffee stout should be. Although the coffee and chocolate are intense, they're not overwhelming. There's nothing ""one note"" about the flavor profile as everything works well together. FBS continues to be my yardstick for this beer style.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a 5.5 taster glass from a Founders tasting @ Tavern on Liberty in Allentown.		A: Pours a jet black with no head, not unlike the CBS.	S: Big bourbon notes followed by coffee and light chocolate.	T: Great balance between the bourbon, vanilla, coffee, and again some very faint chocolate. 	M: A little bit less thick than the CBS, full bodied, medium carbonation, and a smooth finish with little to no alcohol burn as it warmed.	O: I'd have to say that the CBS was better once it warmed up, but the KBS was solid through and through. Perhaps I should have realized that the CBS needed some warming up to do, but this beer was reminiscent of the bottle version, only with a smoother finish and less of an alcohol bite, but not as good on the smell due to the serving vessel.";;;;;;;;;;
On Tap, Poured a deep murky black with a small cocoa colored head. Smell is a complex mix of sweet cocoa, coffee, chocolate and vanilla. Taste follows through with a massive body, chocolate and coffee are front and center, big vanilla component as well, it is sweet and thick, it is like what a mocha should taste like. Thick and complex just wild. It is a huge beer and amazing. I wish i could drink this beer every day. One o fmy favorites of all time. Very little carbonation, very thick. Perfect ballance. Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;
Bottle pours a dark hazy brown with little floaties seen in the glass. You can smell the burbon on this one, and its definately in the taste too. Mixed with a dark malt taste, and it does drink so damn smooth. The 10.20% is very well hidden. This was a decent beer and glad I got to try it. Never had a burbon barrel aged beer before. Nice offering.;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours ruby red with a tan head that lasts throughout the beer.		Citrus hops dominate the nose. A hint of cinnamon and smoky chocolate. Nicely hopped for a scotch ale.		Slightly sweet up front, it's all hops from there on out. Beautiful, refreshing hops.		Medium bodied and very drinkable. Is it fair to judge this against other scotch ales? No. Am I complaining? No.";;;;;;;;;;
"Tap at Founders. It was written on the board as a DIPA, but the black ale seems to fit better, as with the regular Diablo Del Noche.		Cola brown pour, just a whisp of light tan head. Sticks to the glass all right.		Malty, maple and some light booze. Lighter herbal, piney hops.		Taste, strong caramel maltiness and maple. A little charry booziness. Some roast, herbal and piney hops overcome the sweetness.	Don't know where these guys get their barrels, but they add so much to so many of their brews.		Warming but nearly creamy smooth and coating. 7.5% makes this less of a killer than some. Worth trying and less char than Hand of Doom.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.		Wow, what a beautiful beer. A full head rises, then quickly dissipates. Tons of lacing. The beer is ever-so-slightly cloudy, and a nice mix of brown, red, and yellow colors. Simply gorgeous. Nice hop aroma too.		The taste is fantastic, and very similar to a SN Torpedo IPA. Very bitter and hoppy up front, then a smooth finish with hints of toffee and vanillla (I think). Tastes great.		Mouthfeel is a little watery, but perfectly (that is, lightly) carbonated.		I could drink a lot of these. Nearly as high an ABV as Ruination, but much more drinkable.";;;;;;;;;;
"amber liquid that was full of carbonation and chains of bubbles could be scene streaking skyward. Nice three inch head formed on the top, but quickly faded, leaving behind only the slightest bit of foam on the top and a decent amount of side glass lace throughout the session.		 Not much in the way of hops coming through on the nose, maybe some earthy grass like notes, but that was about it, nothing really spectacular as far as aroma. The flavor was decidedly different then anything I had had previously. It had that really clear English ale like flavor, but was really damn strong! Lots of bready and grain like taste in this one, with what almost was a grape like fruit taste in there as well, rather strong";;;;;;;;;;
"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a pint glass. No other information is available on the label. 		Appearance: The body has a rich amber color, good clarity and light off white head. The head fades quickly to just a thin wispy covering. This makes a little slick lacing on the glass.		Smell: The aroma has a firm malty character with a good hit of earthy and lightly citrusy hops.		Taste/Palate: The flavor reflects nose with its solid, lightly toasted malty base. The malt sweetness has some toffee and nuttiness with mellow fruity notes blended with both juicy and earthy hop notes. Hop bitterness keep the sweetness in check and gives good balance to the finish. This also makes this beer very drinkable even at 7.7%abv. The palate is a medium bodied with balanced carbonation. 	 	Notes: This beer is well made and dangerously drinkable.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass. Presents as a hazy straw color with a nice half-finger of foam. The head disappears eventually, but leaves a small ring of lace.		Soft floral aromas. Touch of honey. Citrus notes such as orange and lemon.		Flavors are nicely balanced. Soft, wheaty center. Orange, honey, lemon. A little bit of bitterness in the finish.		Nice mouthfeel - nothing to heavy, but not watery.		This is a great wheat ale. I almost like it better than some of the summer standards like Oberon. Good soft qualities, highly drinkable. Very refreshing. Big fan of this beer - I will revisit this one.";;;;;;;;;;
"a: dark brown with about an eigth inch of head that dissapears fast leaving a little lacing, very inviting	s: smoked malts, hints of chocolate 	t: chocolate smoked malts with the smoked flavor really comes out very nice	m: medium bodied with average carbonation		overall a very nice brew, very refreshing after shoveling snow 	(im reviewing from notes, it snowed the day i had this)";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz single, $4.99 at Star, purchased a good 4-6 weeks after the release - 1 single bottle magically placed on the shelf for my early morning purchase while waiting for great taste tickets		appearance: poured into a newly acquired oversized snifter, murky dirty-amber body, light beige ring, lots of ""floaters""		smell: very interesting - bourbon, vanilla, dark cherry, butterscotch, sweet malts		taste: creamy butterscotch, sweet dark cherry, oak, vanilla, lots of bourbon. The booze is pretty well harnessed here -i've seen 12% come off a lot harsher. It's extremely sweet, even for a wheatwine. Theres also hints of coconut, pineapple		mouthfeel: heavy alcohol burn, otherwise creamy and very sweet		drinkability: its all relative";;;;;;;;;;
"From a bottle into a snifter.		A: Black with a mediam brown head.		S: Vanilla, Chocolate, Bourbon.		T: Alcohol is masked well, but the bourbon is a little overpowering for me. I think I would have preferred to hold onto it for another year as I assume the bourbon would be muted slightly. The chocolate and vanilla were noticeable, but there was very little coffee, which surprised me as it is what I love so much about the FBS.		M: Full bodied and slightly undercarbonated in my opinion. 		O: Founders has done a great job balancing all the flavors, but the bourbon would be better slightly muted in my opinion.";;;;;;;;;;
"500ml bottle, shared, into 8oz glass: from notes.	A: A good head retention, with a deep brownish body, that was dull and cloudy. lacing present.	S: The main aroma was a smoky, roasted nutty malt. Deep, medium aroma, off aromas of cooked food, meat or vegetables.	M/T: The body is a medium to full bodied taste, no real sweet flavors. Good amount of carbonation, with a nice malty character. Smoky off tastes, a very good intense smoked beer.	D: This is a smoked beer that is not over the top smoke to the point that it would not be enjoyable. Good example of the style.";;;;;;;;;;
"On-Tap at Stoudt's on 08-09-2008...		Served in a stemmed glass... golden amber in color with a medium-bodied head. Acceptable lacing and retention. A little on the cloudy side for a Pilsner.		Nice hop aroma... citrus and floral hints mixed with malt overtones.		Good tasting beer... stronger hop taste than their standard pilsner. Crisp upon first tasting, then fades to a mellow malt undertone.		Slightly thicker than a normal pilsner... perhaps more like an IPA... hence the ""Imperial"" in front of the name. 		Another good quality beer from Stoudt's... Perhaps this one should find its way into a bottle sometime so as to reach a few more folks out there!!!";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks TATURBO for the bottle of this, much appreciated! 	This bottle poured out as a light muddy brown color with a soft creamy looking head on top. The lacing is thin but sticks nicely. The smell of booze, maple, some fennel, malts and wood all flood out of this beer. The taste is sweet with some light vanilla flavors, sweet malts, a light amount of bourbon and some earth in there too. The mouthfeel has some soft bubbles and a smooth creamy feel in the mouth. Overall I am very glad I finally got to try this one. I had wanted to give it a shot for a while and I did my best to enjoy each sip of this. This beer is great but isn't my favorite from Founder's.";;;;;;;;;;
Big thanks goes out to a74gent for sending me this one as an extra in a recent trade after seeing it on my Wants! Served from bottle into a Grolsch Pilsner. Poured a deep red-orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, oranges, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, citrus, citrus hop, and grapefruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew! A Doppelbock!? Holy Christ... I was thinking this was an IIPA until I read the style on here. Very easy drinking despite the 7% ABV. I could see myself getting in trouble with this one with large quantities. Very nicely balanced flavor and good aroma going on here. Definitely up there when it comes to favorites of this particular style.;;;;;;;;;;
"It's breakfast time and I want a beer... I'd say this one is appropriate. Recieved KBS via trade with hrking.		Pours into my Delerium snifter thick, oily and black. Only the slightest hint of foam, which is also very dark. Would look nicer if it had a little more foam, but it is understood that a lot of the big beers don't have much head. The thick black appearance of the beer itself is pretty impressive and makes up for it. 		The nose is very strong. It smells like bourbon (obviously), vanilla cocoa-cola, dark coffee, and pancakes covered in butter, chocolate chips and maple syrup.		A lot of the smell is in the taste. There are additions of wood from the barrel aging and hints of smoke, mollasses, bakers chocolate, raisins, brown sugar, and french toast with a splash of cinnamon. The finish has a nice hint of acidic citrusy orange and a salty bite reminiscent of bacon. It really does taste like breakfast. The bourbon?... The bourbon flavor is not overdone and is very well balanced unlike some other beers that are barrel aged in this manner. It's the essence of balance. Noticable, complimentary, but not overbearing. Everything mingles so well. 		Mouthfeel is also top notch. It's thick, full, chewy, syrupy, and sticky on the lips. Carbonation is average. Not high, not low, but jussst right.		It's a one and done sipping beer for sure (especially if you drink it for breakfast) but considering that each sip is pure bliss I'll give it a ""good.""		I've wanted to try this brew since the time I joined BA and have finally had the privellege. It did not dissapoint. Founders did an amazing job with this brew.";;;;;;;;;;
Blackish brown with red tones and nice head that fades fast. Great smell...burnt and roasty. Taste is compexly malty with some definite rye presence. Also alternating waves of columbian coffee and dark bitter chocolate come through. Thick chewy mouthfeel with a smooth bitterness to it. Slight mellow sourness that blends well with the bitterness. Really drinkable. Mouthfeel makes you drink fast.;;Really good. I just decided rye beer is a really good beer style. I'll have to get more of these.;;;;;;;;
"Served on tap at Founders on 1/15/07. Served in brandy snifter.		Appearance: Was dark black with a ring of brown head around it. No lacing to speak of around the glass.		Smell: Amazing smell. Strong bourbon, coffee and stout smell. Kinda hits you in the face but at the same time, makes you want more.		Taste: Taste is the same way. Powerful complex flavors coming together perfectly. The bourbon, coffee and vanilla blend together to make an intense but delicious beer.		Mouthfeel: Well carbonated and surprising smooth considering the alcohol and percentage. Makes you wonder how they do it...		Drinkability: This is definately a sipper. Not to taken lightly and I don't think I could have more then two of these in a sitting. 		Overall a delicious beer that deserves it's rank as #3 on BA. It's also pretty nice that I can just drive a few miles and get this whenever I want, if it's on tap that is. :)";;;;;;;;;;
"[this is where I would tell you where I bought it and for how much, but I plan on going back there soon to buy the rest, so I am keeping it a secret until then!]		Reddish-black with a healthy light brown head and tight lacing. Smells like french-roast coffee, cream, walnuts, bananas, and powdered cocoa. Alcohol is hinted at. Very strong and pleasing aroma! Big body comes on slowly, earthy and dirty, then the crescendo reaches a peak after a second and leaves with a truffle-like finish. Oh! Heavenly! Lingers on and on. A little acidity and alcohol with the dessert flavors blend right together and last for thirty seconds. A great dessert with just enough zip to keep it interesting. After drinking the 500ml I was wishing that I had more. I can't really say that about many beers this thick and strong.		Wow - this is one spectacular beer. Not a session porter, but a good beer to finish a night off with. $2.99 for a 500ml?! What a steal!";;;;;;;;;;
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a creamy pale and light crystal malt scent along with a citrus hop aroma; very nice. The taste is great. It has a smooth and very bitter flavor that boasts of pale and light crystal malts along with intense hop characteristics. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good American pale ale. It has an excellent malt bill and hop selection; a good drinker.";;;;;;;;;;
"Notes from 2/16/11.		Waitress said this is an IPA made with 20% rye and 4 hop varieties. 		Pours golden with red hues. A nice 1 finger fluff crowns the brew. Lacing is very nice as it lines the glass all the way down.		There are a plethora of hop flavors in the smell meeting a wort like malt backbone. The hop flavors remind me of orange, pine, lemon, melon, and some black pepper.		The rye really mellows this brew and adds some spice. I was surprised when the waitress said that this was an IPA. The hoppiness blends with the rye to create an easy drink of peppery rye and mild pine hops.		With a medium feel in the mouth and low carbonation, I would describe the feel is understated but effective.		This is a very drinkable brew worthy of a try. Session worthy and with its mild hoppiness, it could be a gateway IPA for the non-hopheads.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pour a dark porter black with a small but retentive head. Not completely opaque, but decent.		Smoky chocolate malt. Coco puffs and bacon. Surprisingly delicious. 		Tastes a bit more complex than it smells. Chocolate malt moving into mequite, ending on meat and cheese. Not as meaty as a smokier smoke, but still good.			Easily the best Ofallon beer I've ever had.";;;;;;;;;;
"I'll start off by saying that I found this one rather better than the other pumpkin brews I've tried. Howver, there areplenty I have not tried yet...		In the glass, it appears deep orange and a bit hazy. The tan two finger head recedes at a medium pace, leaving just a thin coating on top of the beer.		The smell contains a moderate aroma of pumpkin pie spice, with a smattering of malt underneath.		On first taste, the pie spice hits up front, and gives way to an earthy pale ale-ish flavour, which carries a bit of the spice- but not so much that it overpowers like in other pumpkin brews.		A tight carbonation is noticeable at front- but it fades fast, leaving a medium liquid behind.		I'm not a big fan of most pumpkin pie spice flavoured beers- but this one goes down easy and doesn't overpower.		Be well	-UF";;;;;;;;;;
"Served in a tulip. Pours a hazy orange with a half inch, bright white head that quickly dissipates into a soapy skim, several clusters of ringlets and a thin band around the edges. Some spots and specks of grouped lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose is grapefruit - some sweetness and some piny hops, as well as an earthy quality and a hint of booze in the mix. Taste follows nose, but somewhat muted - nothing really pops on this one in terms of the grapefruit sweetness or the hops; somewhat subdued. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with minimal carbonation and also slightly oily on the tongue. Decent DIPA, but didn't blow me away - nothing really popped on this; however, this feature does enhance drinkability - not to mention an extremely well-hidden abv at 9.4%.";;;;;;;;;;
"Hmm..this pour is deceiving. Its very light golden in color with a slight bit of haze and a very big inch and half of thick white foam. Looks very good and smells even better...		Smell is unbelievably fresh and hoppy. Wow, this is all that grapefruit/citrus intensity that hop heads yearn for. Lots of piney citrusy notes are followed by slight hints of alcohol. Man, this just smells heavenly.		Taste is intense to say the least. This tastes a bit like a greyhound (grapefruit juice and vodka) to start, moreso than any other hoppy beer I've had. Lots of piney, citrusy notes are backed up by some sweet syrup and hints of hot alcohol. 		For a dIPA that comes in at almost 9.5%, DT is very drinkable and oh so good. I was a bit turned off by the idea of paying $11 for 4 bottles but I am glad I did. I hope I can find this one on tap sometime soon. Its got to be amazing. 		Do I dare say that I like this more than Pliny the Elder? Yes, I dare say.";;;;;;;;;;
"Aecht Schlenkerla Helles Lagerbier		1 Pint .9oz Bottle into Pilsener Glass		Pours a slightly misty golden yellow with a slightly off white head.		Aroma is somewhat muted compared to Schlenkerla's other beers. But I think it fits the style much better. The smoke is present in its sweetness and very well balanced with the classic crispness of the Munich Helles Lager style. Some hints of grain and herbal hops as well.		Fine body with plenty of flavor. Again, the smokiness is subdued, merely an accent to an otherwise fantastic Munich Helles. Bit of grain in the finish with a sweet/smokey somewhat dry finish.		What Schlenkerla does with smoke is amazing. On its own this would be a fine Munich Helles but the addition of the smoke gives it something else altogether. Well balanced, not too smoky, and wonderfully drinkable.";;;;;;;;;;
"Best before June 15 2010 stamped on neck:		Pours dark amber - towards brown, with some red hues when held up to the light. A thin creamy tan head has pretty good retention. Lacing sticks.		The smell is of roasted caramel, slightly nutty with an earthy touch. 		The taste is of roasted caramel with some roasted nuts. Not overly roasty, though. Some sweetness is balanced by the mild roast and an earthy tone in the finish.		It is on the lighter side of medium-bodied with medium to medium high carbonation. Flavor lingers for a reasonable time.		An easy-drinking darker amber - has some ""brown ale"" characteristics. Easy-drinking and very well-priced. A good value for the dollar!";;;;;;;;;;
12 oz. bottle served in a snifter. Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a decent frothy off-white head, lacing throughout. Aroma is caramel malts, fruit, grass, peaches, a hint of alcohol, grapefruit, and citrus hops. Flavor is sweet malt, wood, pine, resin, and grapefruit hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry, a bit boozy, and a lot of bitterness that sticks around for a while. Pretty damn good DIPA, could use just a touch more of a malt backbone.;;;;;;;;;;
"(A) This beer pours black as night. No light gets through when held up to a bulb. Forms a really dark brown head that sits up about a quarter to half inch.		(S) The aroma of this beer is pretty much what you would expect. Coffee, chocolate, maple syrup, some oak/wood, a touch of bourbon, a dryness and a hint of licorice.		(T) Just like the nose, dead on. Chocolate stood out to me first and foremost. The maple syrup was consistent throughout the flavor and gave it that even sweetness. Dark roasted malts helped bring up the foundation and give a robust coffee flavor that paired well with vanilla at the end. Excellent.		(M) Very smooth and big body. Thick and malty. It was easy on the palate and very enjoyable.		(O) This was so good I didn't want to finish it. Just fantastically crafted and well made. I love KBS and FBS and this is the best of both worlds and then some more. It's delectable. Worth the hype.";;;;;;;;;;
Had this on tap on KBS Day. Appears like their other Breakfast stouts, pitch black, although not much head and very little lacing. Smell was awesome, lots of rich coffee, whiskey, chocolate, and a bit of sweetness in the background from the maple syrup. Taste was also great, lots of coffee and a nice touch of alcohol to it. The maple syrup gives it a sweeter side compared to regular Breakfast Stout. Mouthfeel was thick and smooth, almost chewy. Drinkability was good, I had to fight to not take a huge swig of it, although the high alcohol content makes it a little too much to have a lot.;;;;;;;;;;
"I enjoyed a pint during the 5th Annual Harvest Celebration at Founders yesterday. The first one I had was on tap. 	A: Opaque orangey glow with a nice full head. 	S: Very strong citrus and hops aroma, not over powering.	T: Lots of hop flavor but not overpowering, good balance with the malt and citrus. 	M: Mild, not an overpowering carbonation	D: good very enjoyable	 	CASK:	It was gravity dispensed b/c the hand pull was not working properly. Same as tap but I felt it was a lot smoother, I think I was a little on the warm side which helped in tasting all the different flavors. I enjoyed it much more from the cask than tap.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a deep black body with a foamy dark brown head. The head decipitates down to a tine lace that sticks too the glass.		Smells of roasted coffee beans and bourbon with hints of sweet maple, dark chocolate and a bit of heat in the finish. 		Taste is mainly the coffee, bourbon and maple all well balanced with hints of dark chocolate and a tiny bit of vanilla at the end. A bit boozy at first but settles as the beer settles.		Mouthfeel is heavy and thick, very velvety yet slightly creamy. Well carbonated and very smooth.	 	Overall this was worth the 20$ price tag. Although I do prefer the kbs, its still highly recommended";;;;;;;;;;
"5.1% ABV per label on the bottle.		Pours a clear dark brown with a 1 inch light tan head that fades to a thin cap. Thin rings of lace and random splotches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of smoked meats, campfire, and band-aids. Taste is of smoked sausages, liquid smoke, band-aids, and roasted malts on the finish. The bitter smoke flavors fade quickly after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very interesting beer. This is the first of the style that I have had and it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. I would try other rauchbiers in the future.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to unclejedi for this one.		12 oz stubby bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Mild off-white head that recedes quickly, but leaves an impressive sticky lace. Color is a deep dark ruby red color. Nice highlights when held to the light.	Smell is malty sweet with a floral back-note. Taste follows with the maltiness and finishes with a slightly tannic hops bitterness.	Solid medium body with a balanced carbonation. Very smooth and drinkable.		If it's no Scottish, it's crrrrap!";;;;;;;;;;
"Had this draft beer at the Bridge in downtown STL. 		Appearance: nice clean light color. Little head.		Smell: Sweet smell, some citrus		Taste: Sweet. Overall good taste very drinkable.		Mouthfeel: good		Drinkability: Good beer. Not my favorite type or style, it was quite good and would easily drink again.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottled September 2011, poured into pint glass. 		A: Pours golden/copper color, 1 finger white head that quickly dissipates.		S: Intense fresh hop smell, citrus, fruity, and pine.		T: Initial taste very fresh hop/and citrus, finishes with bitter hoppy flavor that is not overpowering.		M: Smooth, light, and crisp body, very refreshing.		O: A very good wet hopped beer, balanced and fresh.";;;;;;;;;;
"Growler from Arenbeer- thanks buddy!	Pours a very deep gold for an IPA, and reminds me of Belgian strong pale ales I've had in the past in color. Nose is crazy citrus, with a nice yeasty malty background. Flavor follows suit, with some sweet citrus and toffee and malt flavor. I could literally drink this beer all day if it came to Maryland. Great example of a wet hop IPA.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle courtesy of clvand0...thanks Chris!	Pours a foreboding black. Initial head is near ruby in color, but when it finally settles, a light brown head emerges. The head is dense and easily 2 fingers, lacing is impressive, as is overall retention.	Smell is amazing, even if a bit mild. Chocolate, rolled oats, coffee are in the forefront. Roasty malts are backed by just a hit (a whiff, a smidgen) of hop aromas. The smell just screams: ""c'mon wuss...Sure it's 7am in the morning, but you don't need to go to work today, all you need to do is drink me."" Although I'm paraphrasing.	Well okay then, I suppose I will succumb to temptation and have a sip. Holy crap! Rich, dark, chocolate. Smooth, rolled oats. Bitter espresso coffee. A bit of hop bitterness is buried in the background. The dominant character is the espresso though, although the chocolate is a close second. The word decadent comes to mind. The flavors mingle and create such a nice experience, it's almost like the best coffee you've EVER had. Screw Juan Valdez, I say drink this.	This beer is an experience, and a great one. I can't really find a single problem here. Drinkabilty suffers slightly because it's not an every day sort of thing, at least I couldn't drink this every day. Even if you break this down to its components, it's still great. As an oatmeal stout, it's good. As a double chocolate stout it's excellent. And as a coffee stout, it's amazing. Wow.";;;;;;;;;;
"Presentation - 330 ml green glass bottle with freshness date on back.		A- pours a clear beautiful golden hue with white bubbly head which quickly disappears. Small and medium bubbles.		S- Hops, Malt, grassy, grain.		T- Bitter hops, sweet grassy malty taste, dry and some citrus notes.		M- crisp with lively carbonation. Dry finish.		D- Hey what can I say this is one of my favorite Pilsners, very consumable and all around good. Maybe not as good as it was in the ""old days"" but still a classic.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle, extra from schwaeh, poured into a New Belgium globe.		A: Pours viscous, thick and dark, one of the thickest darkest stouts I've seen. Not much head, about a fingers worth after a fairly vigorous pour, and its dark brown. Head and lacing are pretty viscous and sticky.		S: Darkest malts with touches of sweetness (the hops I'm guessing), chocolate and just hints of coffee. There is a slight funk/sourness, very slight though, as is the alcohol presence. Still a good smell.		T: The dark malts are the star here, its rich and viscous with a touch of heat. There is some chocolate buried in there, and I think some of the sweetness is coming from the hops even thought there is very little bitterness at 90 IBU's. Molasses, brown sugar, and licorice are all apparent on the tongue.		MF: Chewy and silky smooth at the same time, full bodied, viscous, low-medium carbonation. Finishes a touch dry from the hops.		O: Good, but the interesting sweetness and unconventional characteristics keep it from being great. Floats back and forth from a traditional American IS to a Russian IS with the hops and dryness.		I'd recommend it. Thanks Steve.";;;;;;;;;;
"Got in a local trade with zymrgy - Thanks Bob.	A very thick pour with a 1 finger beautiful brown head. Viscous oily consistency. Lacing encrusts the glass. This glass will need soaking!!!	Aroma: A good hop presence here. Melds with the roastiness dying to come out.	Taste: MMM. pleasant bitterness offset by roastiness, some raisin, dried fruit.	Mouthfeel: silky smooth. Carbonation battles through the viscosity of the liquid , blurb , blurb. 	Drinkability: Good, Need to alternate pints of this with a glass of water.		Overall: delicious. I've yet to be disappointed by founders yet. I must seek out more of this stuff.";;;;;;;;;;
Aroma is fairly strong and malty with a faint yeasty undertone and just a hint of miso. It pours a nice clear coppery amber with a fairly thick pale orange-tan head. Flavor is rather mouth-filling, malty with an undertone of hard apple cider and hints of caramel and hops. Fizzy texture leaves a decent tingle behind.;;;;;;;;;;
The beer poured a dark cordovan with a gorgeous tan head. The aroma was heady of alcohol and cherry over a toasted malt base causing great anticipation. The taste didn't quite live up to it. It started off with a slight fruit malt taste and followed up with a nice little bitterness. The feel was medium bodied and slightly dry. This beer for me was too middle of the road. I was looking for something sweet and or tart and would have been happy with something sharp and bitter. What Riggwelter did was promise both and delivered neither. Don't get me wrong it's a solid beer, just not one I would say was in the range of brown ales I'd be looking for.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle:		A: Very dark appearance; head was rusty brown. One of the darkest porters I've seen.		S: Smell was very creamy, but not entirely strong.		T: The taste was phenomenal; it was extremely creamy and smooth with a very nice aftertaste. The initial taste when the beer hits the palate is pretty good, but the taste going down is amazing.		M: Same as taste; it was pretty awesome due to the creamy smooth texture of the beer.		D: Very drinkable; I wish I would've bought a six pack.		My favorite porter to date.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a brilliant ruby color with a short head that fades quickly to a rim. Smell is of beautiful fresh raspberries and a touch of malt in the finish. taste is very refreshing, but a tad light, and it crys out for some more tartness. Nice ripe raspberries, a touch of astingency, and a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied to light and quite quenching. Very drinkable on a hot day.;;;;;;;;;;
"Split with Zapps after raquetball		A - Pours a very dark brown color with a small amount of tan head. 		S - Malt, Fruit, Booze, Candy		T - Caramel, a bit of chocolate at first. Then comes the dark fruit and hops. Finishes with all of the above and a bit of bitterness. Very tasty stuff. 		M - Full bodied and very smooth. Hops mix nicely with the sweetness.		D - Tons of flavor and goes down easily.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thick ebony with a solid creamy brown head on top leaving some patchy lacing. Rich aromas of fresh sweet coffee beans and delicious chocolate...oh baby. First sip is huge...smooth roasted mocha java flavors over some distant hop flowers. Fudge and oats...sweet and lightly dry. Full bodied, chewy, and velvety smooth with a soft bitterness on the back of the tongue. For such a big, rich stout, the drinkability is out of control.		Heavenly stuff. So velvety smooth and flavorful its a good thing I can't get my hands on this more often...its a bit pricey. Definately a treat. Double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout pretty much explains it...";;;;;;;;;;
"This IPA pours a clear amber/orange with one finger of foam that dissipates quickly.		Aroma is hops, floral and citrusy, with a nice roasted/toasted malt backbone. I pick up grapefruit, flowers, a touch of herbs and grass and a bit of musk smell that I associate with Columbus hops, a nice fresh hop aroma. The malt has a very noticeable toasted/biscuit note, much more up front than many IPAs.		Taste is quite smooth overall, the biscuity malt balances nicely with the hop bitterness. It starts with light malt, a tad toasted with a noticeable hop bitterness, this transitions into a brighter, more hop focused flavor. The finish is remnants of biscuity malts and some hop bitterness and citrus. Overall, even a minute after I take a sip, the toasty malt is the dominant flavor on the finish. Quite nice.		Mouthfeel is medium to thick with moderate carbonation.		Overall I very much enjoyed this beer, a big IPA with a strong malt base yet substantial hop flavor. This beer stands out to me among the Northwest IPAs I have tried, it has a very nice balance and a smooth flavor.";;;;;;;;;;
This is a staple for Pilsner beer, originating from The Czech-Republic from Pilzen, where Pilsner beer was born. This beer is the definition of what a Pilsner should be. A light lager style beer! I was impressed when I first had this beer out of a bottle. It has good carbonation which helps for a good head, however often times can dissipate quickly. Decent lacing. Excellent on tap, I suggest a keg! Great beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"This may be a bit of a style-bender, but it is quite good. Enjoyed at the best restaurant in Tampa: Queen of Sheba Ethiopian.		A - It pours a mahogany hue, slightly translucent, with good tan head; very light appearance for the style, doubtless, but it looks tidy nonetheless.		S - There are some elements typical of FES; it is roasty and dark fruity with a UK ale yeast sensibility. Specifically, it smells honey-ish and a bit like raisinets.		T - The brew showcases a sweet malt flavor and accentuates it with nuances of roast and burnt sugars, and perhaps a faintly peaty sweet note; the resultant flavor is somewhat like a theoretical Scottish Export Stout.		M - Nice feel; fairly close to the style norm despite the appearance.		O - I think this tastes very good. Also, though I've not been to Ethiopia, I picture it even hotter than Florida; this is just about as stout as a brew need be for unfortunately hot locales.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured this from a bottle into a snifter. Holy head, I was amazed at the amount of off-white head that formed and how long it took me to actually pour the beer. The head finally dissipates to a full lacing. It is a translucent gold color.		I love the smell of hops and something about this beer didn't quite deliver. The usual suspects of citrus, pine, and grassy notes are there just not as potent as expected. 		The taste delivers the fresh hop taste of citrus and pine. It definitely hits the tongue with a kick and a pleasant aftertaste of wet hops lingers witha sticky component. There is no lack of carbonation.		Overall, this is a easily drinkable beer but I agree with some of the previous reviews that it may be a bit much to try and have more than 1 in an evening. I will enjoy it again.";;;;;;;;;;
"Lovely bottle, endearing story. pours fully into an imperial pint glass, a slight blush to its copper coloring. Lazy thin fuzz on top works itself off the beer slowly. The aroma is of old malt and sour yeast. Not bad, but not strong enough to elicit much emotion.		The taste continues with the aged malt mixture. There's enough variety that the pale is complimented by some thicker, chewyier tastes. The yeast adds nicely to the flavor - just a slight tart that seems to attract the last of the fruit flies from outside. One even managed to get under the coaster I'd set up to protect the ale.		I like simple English pales, and this is a great study aide. Plus, its lower ABV doesn't interfere.";;;;;;;;;;
Had a glass with Sunday beerunch at the CBC and it was a great beer for my eggs benedict. I'll often say a beer tastes like bread, but none have matched the fresh whole-grain taste of this brew. The herbal additions match the seeds and spice of a craft-baked loaf (if that makes sense) and the light lavender with wildflower honey. This is one of the most interesting beers I've had in a while. Check it out.;;;;;;;;;;
"Reviewed from notes taken 1/25. This came from a CP-filled bottle - out of a keg, so I will call it a growler, I think that's the best qualification for it.		The beer pours black, with a beautiful thick, dense brown head, leaving a little bit of lacing down the glass. Looks great from the start. The smell is amazing. You can really smell the sweetness upfront, the maple syrup really enhances that, and it blends and mellows well with the bourbon smell, the charred, roasty, toasty, oak and dark malt combinations, also bringing out a bit of vanilla, and the coffee is in there too, almost getting lost in the incredible mix of smells. A really great smelling beer. The taste, to but it briefly is incredible. This is one of those beers that you hear so much about, you just can't believe that it's true, I actually wanted to like this less than I did. It starts out creamy and chocolatey, the sweetness, combined with the roasty flavors, make it like drinking a coffee and chocolate milkshake, but it's not cloyingly sweet - which may be in part thanks to the oaky-bourbony taste. The syrup isn't necessarily easily picked out, but this is definitely reminiscent of syrup, even so much to make me crave pancakes as a start to dig into it. The vanilla of the barrel really comes out in the taste as well, and I still can't say enough about the rich creaminess, jsut balanced perfectly with the dark roastiness. I mean, it's possibly one of the smoothest (I know that word is a bit lame, thanks the AB) beers I've ever tasted. Just perfect mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, to let you know it's there, but not slow you down any. The drinkability is great, though it's a heavy hitter. I mean, I could barely stop drinking to take notes, but the ABV caught up with me by the end, making the last few sips a little slow, but I really, really loved this beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap in a shaker pint. Deep hazy brownish amber capped with with an off-white head that hangs around with impressive tenacity and leaves a ton of drippy lacing. 		Intense malty nose, toasted, sweet and carmelized with flashes of dark fruit and overripe citrus. Hints of chocolate and earthy hops. Surprisingly, a quick burst of citrusy hops starts things off, but that's soon swallowed up on a wave of delicious malts. Loads of dark fruits- figs, dates, berries- swimming in caramel and brown sugar. A touch toasty and more than a little creamy. Quite a viscous body; this beer is a meal in itself. The finish is sticky sweet with a bit of earthiness. Dangerously drinkable, with only a small amount of alcohol warmth. 		Overall impression: Great stuff, highly recommended.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a Coca-Cola Pint Glass		Appearance-Opaque black with a very very thin brown head that leaves a thin film on top. Little lacing.		Smell-Had to wait for beer to warm a bit, then got a lot of coffee, not in your face though. Some chocolate as well.		Was expecting more coffee in the taste and only got some right up front then went to a milky sweet, fucking awesome chocolate. Then I take another sip and get a ton of coffee with a light and sweet bitter finish. Some Roast and Smoke in there as well which just brings out the flavors in every sip.		Mouthfeel-Medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. Very easy to drink.		Overall-Another good Porter. I've been drinking alot of good ones lately. Very easy to drink before, during, or after a meal. Had a 2nd one with a stew and went perfectly.";;;;;;;;;;
Black thick and syrupy witha dense cocoa colored head. Has a sweet espresso aroma with notes of coffee, chocolate and tootsie rolls. Hops are also present in the nose. Really smooth and full bodied. Flavor is sweet, chocolatey with a subtle bitterness. Finishes with an alcohol warmth. Empty glass is left with nice even lacing. Very nice imperial, close to the Left Hand.;;;;;;;;;;
pours a dark red/brown color with almost no head and good lacing... the smell is ok its kind of mettalic, sour, and bitter not inviting... the taste makes up for the latter.. it is strong bitter hops with an earthy murky oily hop taste that i like ... it gets more complex and taste better as it warms... the mouthfeel is full and robust it coates the tongue and stomach with a malt hoppines and a smooth alcohol burn.... this is another great offering from founders one i will imbibe once a week or so.. its a great scotch ale and a little different not for the faint.. but for those who want to try a different brew..;;;;;;;;;;
"At cellar temperature, this is the most drinkable beer in St. Louis. (It is good when it is cold too.) Occasionally you can find it at a restaurant where they serve it ""cask conditioned"". Get it and drink it. Overall, the beer is well balanced and has a good hop aroma.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle bought as a single from Yankee Spirits, Sturbridge, MA.		Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a dense 3/4"" tan head on top of a dark reddish mahogany hued brew, which lasted a long while. Good lacing. Nose is heavy on the malts, with coffee and chocolate predominant. Taste is of those same malts, and you have to appreciate that the aroma is not guilty of false advertising. Certainly an enjoyable and drinkable porter, worth the search to find...";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a nice red tinged dark brown with a billowy tan head. The nose is absolutely delicious with a huge hit of choclate and caramel up front with a touch of noble hops. The taste is simple but good...chocolate malts with a slightly toasted sense about it. Very creamy smooth and very drinkable. I am definitely grabbing a few of these asap.;;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to dertbert for the bottle.		I have never seen a beer other than Rodenbach with an explosive head such as this. I poured maybe two onces into the glass and it overflowed the top of my pint. Explosive is the only word to describe it. A aggressive pour would likely be all head. The smell is faint but hoppy. The taste is more subdued hops. And if you use your imagination just a hair, it kindly tastes like Mountain Dew. The mouthfeel is wild too. I have been pouring it from the bottle into my mouth and letting it foam up. I know, lame. But it is getting late and all. The drinkability is good. A fine pale ale. Too bad it is not sold here in NC.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance is a cloudy, pale yellow. Thin head that dissipates fast and leaves a sparse layer of bubbles. Little lacing.		Smell is of fresh peaches, wheat and yeast. Has a ""bright"" lemony, sparkling smell to it. Yum!		Taste is strongly of peaches, but also with enough wheat background to make it pleasant and well-balanced. Very tasty.		Mouthfeel is light and somewhat watery. Very bubbbly and summery, though.		Drinkability is top-notch. Goes down smoothly, leaves a great taste and plenty of room for more.		Wheach is one of my all-time favorite fruit beers, and on a short list of preferred summer beers. The peaches are delicious but not overpowering, and overall this brew is refreshing and perfect for a hot summer's day. A fine offering from O'Fallon.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Dark and brown, with shade of burnt crimson. Good clarity. Generous, clingy, cream-colored foam.		Smell: Smoky hickory aroma, salty. Bacon. Rich toffee backbone, with subdued sweetness.		Taste: The strong bacon aroma doesn't fully translate to the tastebuds. It doesn't taste dramatically different than a standard marzen at first. The malt provides a gentle, chewy caramel foundation. The smoke flavor emerges in the middle, combining with the malt to produce a sweet and smoky flavor similar to that of honey barbeque. A lingering, subtle salty taste hangs around in the finish. 		Mouthfeel: Awesome mouthfeel. Creamy, full-bodied, and very smooth. The carbonation could use a slight bump upwards, but the mouthfeel is excellent as is. 		Verdict: A very tasty example of a unique style. Recommended.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Coppery red with a very thin eggshell head.		S - Sweet caramel malt dominates the nose. Some piny hops in the background.		T - Oh wow. The malt and hops mix so well it's amazing. Caramel and piny, citrus. There's a wonderful bitter hop punch in the finish. This is just a fantastic beer.		M - Outstandingly syrupy and sticky. Not much in carbonation but I wouldn't expect that out of such a big beer.		D - I would never have thought that this was 12%. It goes down way too smooth.		I've had this aged and it is amazing. Fresh is just as good. This beer holds a special place in my heart. Well worth the price tag and I will be getting another 4.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter		A- pours a clear red reminiscent of blush wine, about a one finger pink head appears and slowly dissipates to patchy bubbles and a fluffy ring, pretty nice lacing as the head sticks well to the side of the glass		S- smells of ripe raspberries, the sweetness of the honey comes through as well, theres a sharp alcohol tinge that comes out as well which really reminds me of a wine		T- starts out sweet and tart, you get the raspberry and honey in a swirl, the taste transitions into a red wine like taste with a some alcohol that finishes dry in your mouth, i definitely get a bready malt finish in the aftertaste, the only aspect of this that reminds me of a beer, the taste pretty much lives up to the description of the style, however this is my first braggot		M- light-medium body similar to a champagne/ sparkling wine, medium high carbonation that works well with the flavors 		D- not sure on the abv of this one but the alcohol wasnt very noticeable, pretty tasting and interesting, ive had meades before but this braggot combines the two worlds of meade and beer, this is a nice desert style wine, pretty easy to drink, solid job on the part of BBC";;;;;;;;;;
"A more balanced, citrus sweet, and bready IPA.	___		A: Medium orange-copper cloudy body with an off-white somewhat persistent one finger head.		S: Grapefruit and oily hops, and a bit of biscuit malt. Quite fragrant.		T: Up front is a healthy dose of resiny hops, followed by sweeter grapefruit and lemon. The finish is a medium length dry bready malt.		M: Pleasant carbonation, and a nice gritty body.		D: Powerful flavors, but still quite drinkable.";;;;;;;;;;
"Being from the homeland, there hasn't been much to brag about over the years other than the balls to face the Germans in their tanks while we were on our horses... 	Well now i'm here to say that I have something new to feel proud about, being Polish & all...		This is one hell of a beer!	Pours a dark chocholate simular to Guinness without the tight lingering head, the aroma is simular to Samual Smith Oatmeal Stout (another favorite, give it up to England for that one!),	the taste & feel is very nice; caramel, chocholate, roasted nut/coffee~	Carobonation is well balanced, finish is a mixture of the above flavors - nice mix	Not to sound like a broken record but as those before me have stated ""this is a very drinkable beer for the ABV"" 		I found this as a recomendation at my local AJs Fine Foods market from their beer specialist. I have a feeling their ""Beer expert"" is a member of BA. So did he discover this one himself? Or did he get tipped off by his friendly BA website???		Overall rating: The Poles have balls & beer!!! And how can we go wrong with that!";;;;;;;;;;
"Served in straight pint glass. Poured a clean, clear, crisp medium golden amber with under a half-inch of just off-white head that had moderate retention and decent lacing.		The aroma was very well balanced, solid malts supporting some nice hops notes with neither dominating. On the tongue the same applies, some grainy malt, a bit of sweetness and a nice hop tingle on the finish.		The body is spot on, not full, heavy, light or sticky. Drinkability was very good, this could easily be your companion for a day long cookout or sports marathon.		Overall, a very nice beer. This won't blow you away, but it won't disappoint either. I'm guilty, as I suspect many others are, of overlooking this beer far too often. If you're just in the mood for a a good, solid beer that won't wear out your taste buds, this brew's for you.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a magnificent clear golden color with lively carbonation. Somewhat dense one and a half finger head shows passable retention, and weak, spotty lacing. Saaz hop totally dominates the aroma, overshadowing a distinct pilsener malt scent. Sweet malt is abruptly overwhelmed by a sharp hop bite. Find this on draught and you will easily disern the saaz hop flavor from the light-struck green bottle skunk. Obviously light bodied and highly carbonated, this exceedingly hoppy brew is quite crisp and refreshing, but the malt character is difficult to pick up, and perhaps a bit unbalanced. Aftertaste and finish are strong with acidic bite and bitterness, but remains very drinkable and truley satisfying when you're in the mood for a real pilsener.;;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance. Pours into a pint glass like a Frank Stella experiment in color and line -- a hazy, almost witbier orange at the bottom half, the upper half an ivory white. Head remains huge, with large sudsy bubbles, except at the top, which is a creamy foam for about five minutes. Receeds over ten minutes with action that reminds me of sea foam. Leaves chunky lacing.		Nose. Hops. Big, perfumy, yet also restrained. Grapefruit, pine, lemon. As it warms, sweet bread, yeast, and mineral earthiness.		Taste. A variation on the nose. Modulates to grapefruit, orange, lemon peel, pear, and spicy, tongue numbing pepper and clove. Still restrained. Sweet, clean, and somehow, with all the hops in play, light, as a pale ale should be. Nothing out of place.		Mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. Dry with a little hop oil slickness. 		Drinkability. Good, though, as a pale ale on the Indian side of the equation, perhaps not as drinkable as one would expect from the style. Still, for all its complexity, refreshing and pleasurable. This is not a chest hair baring use of hops. Mozart , not Beethoven.		This is one of the best American pale ales I've had. Refreshing and delightful. This is masterful craft beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"A- Bright gold, lightly orange hued. Head is 1/2"", very soft and fluffy, sticky and clingy. The lacing is very sheety down the glass for the duration of the drink. The clarity is a little hazy, but clear for the most part. I really dont see anything wrong with this APA. I hope it tastes as good as it looks.		S- To be honest, when I opened this beer and poured it, I immediately smelled a bubblegum estery aroma, which is not always a good thing (unless we are talking Hefes) but by the time it has aired out a little, I cannot detect that anymore. The aroma is somewhat grainy and grassy, piney...not much going on with the malts. Pretty basic Pale Ale 101.		T- The mouth (unfortunately) follows closely to the nose meaning that there is really not any malt present. That said, the hops are not THAT bitter, but still, I'd like it a little more balanced. It is not complex at all and is semi-flavorless. I really can't knock it; I mean, it's not offensive, just not, well, anything. I keep sipping it waiting on more to jump out and about all I can find is a tad of lemon zest on the back of my tongue. 		M- The beer is thin and watery in the mouth with high carbonation. A little more body would be nice, but isn't that always the case?		D- Here is where things get tricky for me. While it is lacking in complexity, somewhat in taste, it has a good drinkability factor added to it BECAUSE of that. Chugging this tailgating or grilling would be way too easy. I see where you could get bitten, too, with it being 6.2% ABV. It is well hidden and quite a bit stronger than the standard BMC most folks tailgate with.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle received in trade. Thanks TheSevenDuffs! Snow is coming down, the temperature has dropped and the wind is up... May as well start sampling the sundry imperial stouts I have acquired over the summer. No date, poured into a large wine glass. Served around 8-10C, let warm through the serving.		A: Pours a viscous black with a nice 1 cm tall mocha head. Descends quickly leaving a thin, non lacing ring around the edge. 		S: Very boozy to my nose. Some sweet malt aromas that are dominated by molasses and a touch of coffee. Later a bit of toffee comes through.		T: A thick malt body that is dominated by the bitter edge of the coffee. Not bad, though not up my alley. Some of the molasses plays through, and thankfully none of the booze on the nose. A bit of roasted barley comes in too. Over time, the edge of the coffee mutes itself and allows some of the other flavours to play through. If this was the beer start to finish we're looking at a 4.5		M: Low carbonation, Finishes cleanly for a heavy beer.		D: Gets better over time. A nice beer, but that coffee is killing it at the start.";;;;;;;;;;
"A- Pours absolutely pitch black as expected. A small coffee head rises from the brew after is has been poured and seeps back into the murky abyss.		S- The dominate smell here is roasted malt, coffee and a lingering sweetness. The coffee tones permeate the nose and immediately take control.		T- There is an out of control coffee and burnt malt taste going on here. Taste begins sweet and moves into deep coffee which melds with an understated hop bite and some lingering acidity on the back end.		M- Thick with quite a bit of carbonation. Coats the tongue and sticks to the palate.		D- This particular Double Stout is definitely for coffee lovers. While I don't drink coffee I did enjoy and appreciate this brew.";;;;;;;;;;
"Reviewing from notes. I drank this from a snifter. 		A- pours copper in color. A fingers worth of creamy head that has pretty good retention. Moderate lacing left behind. 		A- floral hops with tropical fruits. There is a nut or toffe smell present also. 		T- hops are up front and in your face. Not overly bitter though. Sweet caramel malts and a bit of rye to finish things off. Thr rye wasn't as prevelant as I had anticipated , but I still really liked the brew. 		M- medium bodied but really coats the pallate. Has a nice crisp finish. The hops stick with ya for a bit. 		D- I could have easily polished a few more of these off.";;;;;;;;;;
In appearance, Black Rye almost lives up to its name. It is, in fact, a very dark brown, with ruby highlights. Nice chocolate-colored head and lacing. Looks like a stout, and smells like one too, roasted coffee along with the promised rye. Tastes hoppier than the smell, a floral hoppiness, which contrasts well with the chocolate and coffee malt flavor. Creamy mouthfeel. One of the most interesting beers I've had. I think it's interesting how the rye, though part of the malt, has a hop-like character, and I think that putting it in a sweet, malty, stoutish beer really showcases that well. Fascinating.;;;;;;;;;;
Wow, after my second bottled sampling of this beer, I feel I should rate it. This is the best Imperial Stout ive had in awhile and im esprecially impressed by how good this is at its bright, young age. The color is dark, the darkest beer Ive seen in awhile. Tremendous body. Fairly nice nose. Amazing flavor of chocolate and coffee, but there is also an inordinate, but graceful amount of fruit flavor going on. A really, really good beer!;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from the 12oz bottle into a Belgian chalice.		Appearance- Beer pours nearly solid black but when held to the light it has just the hint of reddish hues around the edges. Head is hardly present at all, a fingernail thin, but quickly dissipates to tiny specks of carbonation. Lacing on the sides are suprisingly thick.		Smell- Liquid smoke with a malty roast background. Very little outside the smoke but dilligence on the smelling reveals toasted wheat bread and french roast coffee. Hops are also present but hardly noticable. 		Taste- Wow. This is quite a suprise for a cheapy 12oz bottle I bought in Newport, KY. Thick lingering smoke with a big malty chocolate backbone. Roasty and light in the finish. Hops are a perfect balance of bittering, not too much at all. Wonderfully balanced with the smoke here.		Mouthfeel- Medium bodied with suprisingly moderate carbonation. The carbonation is hardly visible, but is present on the palate.		Drinkability- Once again, this beer shines overall in it's drinkability. If I find this again, which I may in my travels, I will be sure to pick up a 6pk of this. It has just about everything that you need for a perfect smoked porter. I would say this beer even rivals Stone and would give Alaskan a run for it's money.";;;;;;;;;;
"From a bottle into a large snifter.		Very black with garnet notes. Minimal chocolate head with some lacing. I was hoping for a bit more head, but this isn't unheard of in the style.		Dark coffee. Mostly the dark roasted beans (Sumatra) come through, but there's some espresso as well. I don't detect much chocolate, but that isn't disappointing. Some other things coming through, but it's in the world of these two flavors. A hint of toffee, some chemical smell that is related to the alcohol.		Several layers of coffee - espresso and several dark roasts. Chocolate is tame and slightly sweet. There's the same chemical flavor - something like the ""paintbos"" in pinotage wines. Hints of spice - allspice and cinnamon.		I actually wanted this to be more dense. It goes down easily, and isn't as heavy as most beers of this style. It's very good.";;;;;;;;;;
"a: This was a clear, golden amber color. It poured with a medium sized sticky head. 		s: I found toffee, sugar cookies, toffee, and grassy, herbal hops.		t: Toffee and sugar cookie sweetness up front, then some strong, leafy, moderately herbal bitterness. I might have noticed that hint of rye as well.		m: Crisply carbonated with a long, lingering bitter bite.		d: Definitely brings fall to mind. Thanks to titosupertramp for this one, if this was local I'd be looking for a six pack.";;;;;;;;;;
22 oz bottle pours a hazy rusty orange/brown body with a medium beige head. Nice lacing. Aroma is sharp and pungent leafy hops. Citrus rind and pine, with a faint hint of burnt caramel. Medium body with plenty of carbonation and some oily hop resin. Taste is all about the hops. Pine, grapefruit, and citrus rind. Resinous hop bitterness from start to finish. Just a vague hint of malt sweetness. Bet there are plenty of IBU's in this one. A hop monster for the hopheads. A bit over the top for me.;;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle. 		Almost opaque black. Two finger tan head. spotty oil patch lacing, and a ring that clings to the side of the glass. Spicy rye aromas mixed with chocolate malts and some citrusy hops. Flavor is a nice melding of chocolate, caramel, and spicy rye note. A nice Citrusy hop component is there as well. Finishes with a lingering nutty sweetness and a lite bitterness. A hint of smokiness detected as well. Moderate mouthfeel, with a crisp, lively carbonation. A great drinker.		Can't wait for Founders arrival here in NC. This will be part of my regular rotation. Thanks DavidEddie for the wonderful extra.";;;;;;;;;;
"Acquired 2 bottles from table and vine at a hefty price of 8 dollars a bottle. 12oz 2010 KBS.		A - Oil spill black body with a brown head that really has come balls to it. 		S - Bourbon, chocolate, coffee, maple syrup, vanilla... wow. Every component stands on it's own and really invigorates the senses. 		T - Coffee and bourbon up front. A maple syrup chocolate vanilla finish. I grouped them together but each flavor really stand out just like in the smell. When rating some stouts I am not exactly sure about certain flavors I'm getting. With these stout each component is so pronounced and exciting. 		M - Thick full body. So smooth and creamy. I could sip on this and let it swirl around my palate all day. The alcohol is completely hidden. 		D - I split this one with soupedup and put mine in a tulip. I went back and fourth on it - smell, sniff, smell sniff, ect. I tried to make it last but had a hard time doing so. 		No hype here. This is an amazing stout. My new favorite in fact. Too bad I have to cellar my last one for another year before I can have it.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a bright golden color that is crystal clear with a decent white head. Nice retention and some lacing is left behind.		Subdued aroma that has a mild wheaty/grainy character with crisp yet light hops. 		Well balance and refreshing beer. Just enough malt sweetness, toasted grain, and spicy hops to hit the spot. Not quite a Macro Lager, more of a true Pilsner. Flavor is just what you want in a tropical setting - Not dumbed down but not too heavy. Slight metallic and very mildly skunked note from the bottle that you don't get on tap.		Very easy to drink. Crisp and refreshing - a real thirst quencher. Light and crisp on the tounge with a little more body than expected. Carbonation level was just about perfect. 		I greatly enjoyed this beer. Pretty much stuck with it for my entire vacation. This beer isn't perfect, but hard to beat when it's 90+ degrees and there is sand between your toes.";;;;;;;;;;
Had this on tap at the Founders brewery. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark reddish orange color. Very flowery in the aroma with caramel and light vanilla creeping in. The taste was just amazing coconut and toffee combined - wow. Later on molasses and caramel apples came in. A very uniquely tasting beer. Mouthfeel is very thick and chewy. A nice smooth finish. A great night cap beer or after dinner beer. Founders needs to be in Texas NOW!!!;;;;;;;;;;
"It is hard for me to review beers that I drank on tap because it is easy to be distracted. When I am in the comfort of my own home I can review as I drink and it remains fresh on my memory. I'll give it a shot. I Thought this was a solid effort by Yazoo. The beer is a deep brown with a thin head. It has a faint smells of which were malted barly and a light hoppiness which translates into the taste. Nice smooth beer but lacked a little depth for my tastes. Not very complex but just a real nice beer. I did not say ""wow"" when I drank it but I would drink it again. Feels good in the mouth and goes down easy with little aftertaste. I like aftertaste as long as it is consistant with the beer. Good effort but needs a little more.";;;;;;;;;;
"Well, what can I say--the best double IPA I've had so far. 	This wonderful beer pours a nice deep gold color, and the aroma hits you immediately. A rich earthy, citrusy sweet malt smell hits the nose, and begs you to take a sip.		It tastes even better. This is a rich beer full of so many wonderful flavors, you have to take a few sips to digest them all! It is quite possibly the most drinkable 10% abv commercial beer I've had (a few homebrews I've had beat it barely). There are no hot alcohols (fusels) in the mouthfeel, and it has a decent body to the beer as well. The balance of hops and alcohol are truely amazing in this beer. 		Grab this one up before the hop shortages makes them not produce this wonderful beer anymore!";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours from the bottle a transparent dark amber with 1.5 finger thick head that dissipates to a thin layer and laces nice on the glass.		Smell is sweet malt and hops combination, basically if you poured a nice hoppy IPA into a malty crisp lager.		Taste is a smooth malty front followed by shot of citrusy hops, and then the two combine to finish out on the back of the tongue. Just an interesting combination of sweet malt and piney, citrusy hops; a unique tasty brew.		Mouthfeel is smooth, lightly carbonated, a little bit of lingering flavor from the hops. 		Very drinkable, I'm glad I picked up case so I can sit and enjoy a few more over this weekend.";;;;;;;;;;
"Orange-gold in hue, the liquid is quite hazy, no I mean murky. Umm man, there is lot of yeast chunks. This is the antithesis of clarity. The head was off-white in color, at the apex the foam was two fingers in height and then it quickly faded to a healthy cap that was thicker around the edges. This small cap lasted for the entire consumption. The appearance is interesting. I like unfiltered beers but far too much yeast found my glass, I tried to limit it but I had no hope. Oh well. Subsequent lacing was webby and unorganized, it wasnt very prevalent but it was widespread enough to be notable. The nose is loud in some regards. Huge notes of tropical fruits infused with a sprig of wildflowers from some warm island. Peach aromas are pronounced as well. The hops are juxtaposed. Biting, piney notes that intrigued me, plus there are some overwhelming marijuana vibes. The malt is big, really big for an IPA. Thundering notes of burnt caramel and molasses. Wood. The bouquet lacks forcefulness, some of the smells are loud but the nose on the whole is oddly restrained. Im not sure what to make of it, I like it but Im not impressed. It seems unrefined and raw (but not boastful, odd). Interesting but not inviting. The palate is heavy with that marijuana taste. Bong water? That would explain why it looks this way! I really wish at some point in my younger, stupider days I would have drank some bong water so I could compare it to this beer. Opportunity lost. The bitterness is weak, it reminds me of leaves and wood chips. Hops? Fooled me. Citrus zest. Orange juice with pulp. Bark. Burnt caramel. Molasses. Roasted grains. Grapes. At the swallow is a blast of alcohol heat that lights up my tongue. I like the heat; it adds some more complexity to this very, very odd tasting beer. The aftertaste is dry and mellow; it is like I smoked a joint a half hour ago. I guess I am so use to IPAs just being big, blasts of citrus from the C hops. This beer is unique I will give them that. Do I love it? No. I am intrigued. I wish I had another bottle or two so I could wrap my mind around it again. The palate is an odd son-of-a-bitch! A little bigger than medium in body, low but natural carbonation helps produce a pleasant, creamy mouthfeel. Relaxing. It turns out I kind of liked this beer. It is too unique for me not to like it. It is big, flavorful with a jolt of alcohol. I could kickback with a few of these, eat some cheese, listen to some P-Funk yeah, that would be a good night. Purchased on-line at Liquid Solutions. Worth a try.";;;;;;;;;;
"This beer pours a huge head with amazing retention and a nice golden color.		The hop smell isn't there. I whiff and I whiff, but I don't smell much. There are some citrusy hop notes, but nothing that intense.		Taste is of a basic decent ipa. Mostly pale malts with an adequate bitterness. Nothing special. It's good though.		Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. I'd like a little less carbonation, but that's a personal preference.		This is a decent ipa. Give it a try. It's nothing special or out of the ordinary though.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured into a Flying Saucer Christmas 09 Yule Fuel glass black with a thin tan head. Great lacing. The nose is a little light but roasted malts are very present. The taste is strong of dark chocolate roasted malts with some oatmeal after taste. The oatmeal leaves the mouthfeel dry, but not too dry. This is a very drinkable stout that I wish I could have more often.;;;;;;;;;;
"A: Sky clear yellow colour with massive head.		S: Pils smell, full of hops, small tones of malts. You might find some apple and citruses.		T: The way a good pils should taste. Hoppy with alcohol bitterness on the tongue. 		M: Light body with no carbonation.		D: Good beer with lower reputation than it deserves in Czech Republic. Definitely one of my favourites pilsners. Good for hot summer time.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle split and poured into a tulip. 70 IBUs, 11.2% ABV, Bottled 02/17/09.		Thanks a ton to bnieman and his Dad for sharing this one.		Before I go further I need to make a disclaimer that I've had this before with a lot of age on it. An absolutely fantastic beer. It deserves a review from me better than this, and when I get some more this year, this short chicken-scratch will be replaced.		A - Completely black with no highlights, it pours very smooth and quiet with a low dark tan head. No retention leaves a little ring and low-level lacing. With that kinda alcohol I wouldn't expect much head.		S - Dark roasted malts with coffee, mocha, and bittersweet chocolate and an overarching barrel aged bourbon nose. Bold and robust, it kicks your ass with one whiff. So much coffee roastiness.		T - Major boozy bourbon barrel flavor with tons of roasted, bitter black coffee and mocha. The malts are all over the place with no hops to be found here.		M - Very smooth and robust with an incredibly full body and a very dry and bitter finish.		D - An absolutely phenomenal beer but one best shared with a friend or consumed in little sips. This breakfast would be one hell of a way to start the day.";;;;;;;;;;
Awesome extra from Bigdaddywil. Very dark reddish amber, almost brown. A one finger, off-white head lingers for a short minute. The lacing disappears quickly. Immediate slap in the face (nostrils) from the bourbon. Nice. Huge sugary malt notes in the nose with some caramel and brown sugar. Initial taste is sweet and malty bourbon, with some caramel and vanilla as well. Very boozy and delicious. The finish is remarkable. Long bourbon alcohol finish that lingers, imparting a sticky coating to the back of the tongue. Full bodied with good carbonation. Backwoods Bastard leaves my mouth dry and wanting another drink.;;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle poured into a MTH Snifter Glass.		A- One finger off white head dissipates quickly to a nice sticky collar around the glass, dark amber color, decent carbonation.	S- Nice hoppy profile, pine, grapefruit, rye, spice, malt base.	T- Very similar to the aroma, pine, slight citrus taste, nice bitterness to this beer, rye is present, grapefruit, slight malt backbone to balance it out.	M- Medium mouth feel, I had this one other time and I remember there being a bigger bit to this beer, mouth feel felt a little under carbonated on the initial taste. Dry finish.	O- Decent beer, I feel like I might have drank a bad bottle because I remember this being a lot better, either that or my palate has changed tremendously since the first time I drank this. Other than that still a solid beer from founders.";;;;;;;;;;
The most striking point about this beer is that it is a 10% ABV and it is very well hidden. Actually, it's quite startling how well hidden the alcohol is, and there is no throaty harshness. The beer pours an ever so slightly cloudy orange amber with minimal head, lacing, retention. The smell is delightful hoppy esters, lemon grass, sweet malts, raspberry or other such fruit. The consistency is quite thick, heavy, and bordering on the syrupy consistency of a lighter barley wine. There is little carbonation in this beer. The taste is not quite as nice as the aroma would lead me to, but it is very nice. You will get the orangy rind, the sweetness of an aperitif, the grassy oils and esters of ripe hop, and some candied sugars. This is a complex beer well worth seeking out. It comes as quite a surprise. L'Chaim.;;;;;;;;;;
"Got this bottle from a BIF, thank you.		Poured into a nonic at 51 degrees.		Appearance: A one finger dark tan head taht is creamy and foamy. The body of the beer is jet black. The clarity of the beer is opaque. The retention on the head didn't last long. 		Nose: A very nice deep roasted malt, dark chocolate, molasses, espresso, wood, citrus, floral esters, and the burnt character. 		Taste: A very rich deep roasted malt. The flavor in the beer are the burnt character, molasses, espresso, oaky, citrus, floral esters, molasses, it has a little phenol, and solvent 		Overall: The body of the beer is thick and chewy. The mouth feel of the beer is creamy, smooth, and rich. The finish on the beer is almost full. I really like a good RIS and this beer has it. I love the chewiness, the thick full body, and the creamy smooth finish.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bright straw body, thin unimpressive head.		Sweet, spicy and floral scent. Buttery aromas flirt with complex Central European (assuming Saaz) hops. Nice.		Same herbal spice leads into a rich bread and butter body. Sharp bitterness rounds out the flavor. Yeast is noticeable on the long, lingering finish.		Soft carbonation supports a smooth but filling body. I've gotta say that I'm wonderfully surprised by this beer. I've had this in the bottle a number of times and have failed to enjoy it. The can appears to have made all the difference in preserving freshness and taste. Highly drinkable.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a dark brown with a creamy tan head. Lots of tiny lacing all the way down the glass. Smell is sour with a tart fruitiness, herbal hops and some nutty malt.		Taste up front is sour and lightly vinegary but that soon fades a couple sips in. The sourness that remains is followed quickly by a bitter herbal hop taste and then finishes to a nice roasted coffee bittereness. Smoky. The flavors are all very distinct at first and then begin the mesh and blend into each other as you drink. The aftertaste is bitter, half hops and half roasted coffee and lingers for several minutes on the palate. Smooth drinkin'. An amazing beer, one of the coolest brews I ever had the pleasure to drink. Bravo!";;;;;;;;;;
"A big thanks to fogdog for this bottle.		Appearance: Pours a murky, dark reddish-amber, with a slowly-coagulating, creamy, khaki-colored head. Lots of suspended yeast sediment floating around. Head doesn't last long; becomes a wispy ring of bubbles. Leaves decent lace.		Smell: Dark berries, molasses, oak, fruity esters, bready yeast, raisins and spices. As I sit here sniffing it, the dark fruits and bread aromas really start coming forth. Maybe a little bourbon as well. Great balance and mixing, though I wish it were a tad stronger.		Taste: Lots of warm bread, caramel, and spice. Dark fruit flavors are there but a bit subdued, especially when compared to the smell. Sweet molasses and bourbon flavors fill in very nicely. Flavors meld very well, just like in smell.		Mouthfeel: Slick and somewhat syrupy, yet watery. Medium-bodied with low carbonation. Feels a bit gritty with all of the yeast sediment. Great mouth-numbing and good warming as well.		Drinkability: A milder flavor and smell than I'm used to, thus making it more than just a sipper. Not the best old ale I've had, but one that's worth a try. Wish there was a little more umph to it.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Poured really nice, light copper head but faded rather quickly. 		S - Sweet and flowery.		T - Pretty much as expected for a bitter though sweet, bitterness only really present in aftertaste.		M - Nice carbonation though a little thin.		D - Very much a decent session beer.		A solid bitter and I'd like to try the cask version. The Sneck Lifter from this brewery on cask was one of my highlights this year.";;;;;;;;;;
"I got this beer from MABZ as part of the 2006 Great Race BIF. I am sure it will be wonderful.		This beer pours jet black with no light making its way through. It has a very small brown head that fades very quick, leaving a surprizingly large amount of laces.		Wow. This beer smells woody. It has a smoky aroma. It also has a strong coffee aroma. I can setect a subtle chocolate scent also. I think I might be smelling an aroma almost like kaluah also.		This beer tastes strongly like coffee. It also has a slight smokey taste. Mild chocolate flavor is also present. As with the aroma, I taste a slight kaluah flavor to it. All I can say about the flavor is wow.		This beer is low in carbonation. It is quite smooth. I leaves a coffee aftertaste on the palate. It is very full bodied. 		I think this beer would make an excelent session beer. The only problem is that it is a little high in alcohol. Beware when drinking, or else you might be in over your head.		I cant thank you enough MABZ for parting with such a great beer. I dont know if I would have been able to do the same.";;;;;;;;;;
"Lil Napoleon IPA, 1 week after this establishment opening in November 2010.		A Orange amber color, some head, but not significant 4		S Nice citrusy hop aroma, some breadyalt aroma also. 4		T Big hop hit at first, followed by some nice roasted malt, a little diacetyl, but it's good and doesn't detract. Finish is clean. 4.5.		M Med to heavy body, good thickness, could use more carbonation. 4		D This and the Brown were the best beers on this day. This one was my favorite. 4";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle pours into my glass a hazy straw yellow with golden highlights and a small bubbly head that quickly fades. Aromas of crisp wheat grain maltiness along with plenty of yeast esters. Hints of clove, pepper, bubblegum and some fruity banana notes as well. A little mellow overall.		First sip brings a crisp wheat malt body upfront that carries into spicy yeast tones. Lots of fruity esters with banana coming through most. Clove, pepper and bubblegum accents that flow down to a crisp clean finish. Tasty hefeweizen overall.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice crisp twang from the wheat and good spritzy carbonation. This one is refreshing and ends up going down easy enough. A solid hefe from Stoudt's that would be good drinking in the summer months.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured out darker than most IPAs which was intriguing. And then the smell kicked in. Lots of graprefruit hops. Very pungent, but pleasing smell. Then came the taste. Over the top hops. I love a hoppy beer and this was all it was cracked up to be. I feel like there are better IPAs for the price, but as a rare splurge it was good to try.;;;;;;;;;;
Opaque black beer with a dark brown head.  Exactly as advertised in that it is an over the top stout.  Roasted coffee and some good hop bitterness dominate the flavor.  Chocolate is hidden well but can be discerned (or imagined).  Sweetness is kept to a minimum.  Very enjoyable and interesting brew.;;;;;;;;;;
"Dark, rubescent chestnut with considerable reddish amber accents. The beer is opaque, although bright sunlight makes a valiant effort to make it all the way through the glass. Up above is a compact cap of lightly toasted ecru foam that has a featureless surface, which usually indicates a softness that does not bode well for lacing. Very little sticks in the end.		Wow, smoked is right! This baby comes pretty close to the smokiness of the Schlenkerla line of beers and is more like a raunchy rauchbier than any smoked porter that I've ever had. Smoke 'em if you've got 'em is what I always say and O'Fallon has done just that. The beer smells more like hickory-smoked meat than anything else and smells less like a porter than it probably should. Since almost no beerness is evident, the score will have to be a grudging compromise.		This is delicious beer. Again though, comparisons to smoke-cured meat just cannot be ignored. If that sounds disgusting to you, put the bottle down and move along to something a little less adventurous. Smoke permeates the flavor profile, but it does fade enough by the second half of the mouthful to allow some semblance of roasted maltiness to peek through.		I do pick up some smoked, sweet chocolate to go along with the smoked barley, but it's a minor player. There's also a hint of smoked bitter hops on the smoke-filled finish (get the idea?). The body is a minor letdown in that it's no bigger than light-medium.		I knew nothing about Smoked Porter before plucking it off the shelf, but I'm always up for a good smoked beer. This is definitely a good smoked beer, albeit one that would benefit from a touch more malt to fill out the body. A solid effort that makes me curious about the rest of the O'Fallon line.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a cloudy straw yellow color with little head. Smells of banana and some clove, but also a light sweet maltiness. The taste is also fairly light with some lightly toasty sweet malt up front, some light banana, some graininess, and a bit of light clove spice on the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly spritzy, and it picks up some more spiciness as it warms. A fairly simple and straightforward hefe, one that I could definitely keep drinking more of.;;;;;;;;;;
"From 04/30/11 notes. Poured into my SAVOR snifter.		a - Pours a pitch black color with an inch of tan head and light carbonation evident.		s - Smells of smoke, bacon, roasted malts, toasted malts, and light coffee.		t - Taste again is lots of smoke and bacon. Also some roasted malts, coffee, and light dark chocolate. 		m - Medium body and low carbonation.		o - A pretty nice smoked porter. Lots of smoke and bacon in the nose and taste; reminds me of Beer Geek Bacon. Would have it again.";;;;;;;;;;
Bitter chocolate and deep coffee notes. It has the right amount of thickness which gave it that meaty, chewy, and creamy quality. The finish is silky smooth and then stingy. Definitely one of my favorite stouts of all time. Worth trying if you can find it anywhere nearby.;;;;;;;;;;
"Strong golden color with white head that doesn't persist. There is nothing very special about this beer with look or smell, but once it arrives in your mouth the combination of flavors will overwhelm you. Mostly smooth with a hard-to-place exact flavor and a slight tinge of bitter/hoppy remaining in the mouth (which is the only drawback on taste since I don't enjoy that). Most surprising beer enjoyed in awhile. Tap beer was much better than bottled version purchased later. Perhaps freshness and container played a part in the different flavor. Bottle had stronger bitter/hoppy flavor during and persisting longer afterwards. 		Definately a must try, especially when it looks like an average beer but tastes much better.		Enjoyed several glasses a ""Circo"" in the Bellagio in Las Vegas.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a rather flat, slightly hazy amber. Looks like a barely wine with big bubbles around the edges.		Smells of pears, very resiny, pine needles, with hints of skunk (like marijuana skunk). A faint bit of garlic or onion as well.		Whoa.. Alcohol punch here; no surprise. more of the resiny, skunkiness in the taste. Noticeable pear and tropical fruit flavors but with a finishing heat, almost like its laced with chili peppers. The bitterness is pleasant and lingers after the taste is long gone. 		Full bodied, viscous, with little carbonation. The heat of the alcohol makes up for it though.		This is bold. Tastes like it has more alcohol than it does. Glad I got to try and maybe I should have had it a bit fresher, but this tastes like it could be aged as well. If you dont like bitter, dont bother.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a very dark bown, almost black. Creamy tan head that leaves nice lacing in a clean glass.		Smells roasty and smoky, some grilled asian chicken in there, not quite teriyaki. Some sweetness.		Very nice mouthfeel, not overly carbed. Just the right ammount to let the sweetness and the smoke to come through. Quite tasty and balanced. Would definately drink this again.";;;;;;;;;;
"Reviewed from notes		Appearance: Holy crap! Look at that color! Its like mid-night on the Alaskan tundra! You know I love it when they are this dark!		Smell: Deeply roasted coffee and caramel aroma. I don't like coffee, but I really like it in beer for some reason...Really Malty smell as well		Taste: The coffee hits you first and then it smooths into maltiness and caramel. The more I drink, the smoother it goes down.		M-Medium body and smooth		O-Great porter.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz. hand-bottle shared by stopbarking; split 5 ways. Thanks Daniel!		The elusive Canadian displays an opaque darkness that clings to the edges of the glass with a sugary, syrup-like viscosity. The head is dirty khaki in color and retains surprisingly well for the ABV. Swirling the snifter quickly builds the foam level, but the aroma never really took off for me. Smells a bit muddled, in fact, with ethanolic booze and soft chocolate undertones. The sweetness is there, but I'm not getting too much maple or barrel aroma.		CBS' flavor more than makes up for what the aroma 'lacks'. A delicious mix of dark chocolate, toffee, earthy hop bitterness, Grand Marnier, and sweet, sweet maple. The syrupy sweetness never becomes cloying, however, making this beer surprisingly quaffable despite its big, complex body. The mouthfeel helps the drinkability, too, as Canadian is light on the tongue (heavy in the stomach) and almost fluffy with carbonation. All in all, a superb beer clearly worthy of the hype (a rarity these days).";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap Dec 17 from notes:		A: Its' appearance is slippery and oily black. Good size tan head with moderate retention and excellent lacing.		S: The nose is potent to say the least. Some hops, oak, dark malt, maple, and a hint of booze. Raisins and coco appear as the beer warms. 		T: It starts out with oak, vanilla, and a fruity/ester flavor I can't put my finger on. Very boozy and woody in a good way. There are a ton of interesting flavor notes going on. A symphony of sorts.		M: Slick and thick with moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel really adds to the overall effect of this beverage. 		D: Great brew that I will seek out again. It is a bit too strong for more than 1 in a sitting, but delicious none the less.";;;;;;;;;;
seems to be the most popular for its ability to hid the abv quite well with a taste that almost leans on the side of mild english porter. pour is a clear light brown. and i don't mean amber... but a solid brown that lets through quite a bit of light. nose of apples and dark fruit. dark malt of sparse chocolate and mild dunkle sour. sour of plum fruit with a sufficient sweet. mild grape and a significant malt backbone but not too much density. mellow body. drinkable even in summer. some grape even. the most 'crossover' into a more english format of beer for the brewery i've had yet but extremely impressive coming from a lager.;;;;;;;;;;
Ah the hedonistic pleasure of a pulchritudinous dark and brooding stout, lazing away in my chalice, the head stupendous in size, creamy in its consistency and the fine chocolate brown latticework of lace that longingly caresses the glass. The sweet hint of toasted grain, bittersweet chocolate and coffee, quite a pleasure for the schnozzle, sweet at the front, thick and rich at the top. Finish is perfectly hopped, modest in its carbonation with a dry lingering aftertaste and a good representative to the sweet stout style, and a good beer for the novitiates to the dark side.;;;;;;;;;;
"Got a pint of this during my recent visit to the brewery. This beer is a clear, medium to dark, amber/copper color. The white head was an inch thick when served, settling to a nice thick ring lining the inside of the glass. Little lacing. Aromas of citrus hops and a bit of caramel malt. The hop flavor wached me over the head from the first sip, followed by some citrus and slight caramel malt. This is a real bitter hop monster, a one dimensional beer to be sure. Has a crisp, full bodied, frothy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Easy enough to drink. Not shabby at all.		Eric";;;;;;;;;;
"500mL bottle poured into traditional pint glass		A - Pours a pitch black nothingness with a decent 3/4 inch tan head. Lacing is solid when tipped but falls quickly. 		S - Lightly caramelized sweet malt dominates with some prune and plum dark fruit flavor. A touch of black licorice flavor. 		T - Smooth and sweet with some bitter, drying aspects near the finish. Clean, dark fruit taste with some licorice spice. A touch of floral hops in the finish as it warms. 		M - Medium to full bodied with a smooth and slightly viscous mouthfeel. Low carbonation. 		D - Closer to a stout than most porters I am used to, but that seems to fit the style. Alcohol is high but not much of a factor in taste. One of the most sessionable beers compared to its ABV I can think of. A beer I would love to try fresh on-tap. -";;;;;;;;;;
"How to add anything to the other 2,000+ reviews? It probably is not happening, but I found some so it is getting reviewed.		Poured into a tulip glass. Black as a desert night. A nice finger of tan head formed and continued to come together after the pour. 	I could smell it in the pour. Dark chocolate, black malt, alcohol and milk chocolate. Strong and rich.	Tastes black; bitter chocolate, alcohol and burnt grain.	Super smooth, a little creamy, medium body and moderate carbonation.	I was surprised by the alcohol smell and taste. It does not have an exceptionally high ABV. Still, the smell was perfect: big and bold. The taste was incredible. Perfect accompaniment to breakfast or a bourbon.";;;;;;;;;;
"A dark golden beer with a slight haze. The head is thin and creamy.		Smell is light smokey, leaving only room for some malty notes. Yet the smoke is subtle.		Taste is smokey with bready malt. The smoked malt is adding a subtle smoke flavour. Without any band-aids or rubbery notes, this is quite unique. The smoke reminds me most of a fresh timber fire, crisping wood. There are some biscuity and amber-malty notes that contributet to the body of the beer. The smoke makes this beer a really unique lager beer, which I wouldn't drink all night, but a couple a night will do.";;;;;;;;;;
"App- Pours a dark copper--almost a mahogany in color with a thin film for a head. Spotty lacing and residue on the glass.		Smell- First a smell of musty hops and the sweet smell of rich caramel malt comes later. A tinge of alcohol can be sensed as well. Alot going on here and difficult to separate it all out		Taste- The beer is more bitter than I would have assumed. The bitterness is of a coffee/dark chocolate type rather than one of hops, although those are present as well. A hint of what seems to be smokiness and/or peated malt comes in as well and gives the beer an earthy flavor. Sweetness is subdued and not as present as in the smell, but shows in the aftertaste.		Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Full bodied and has a lasting impression on the tongue, so not one to chug. The alcohol is hidden well by the various flavors in the beer, but there is a lot to try and concentrate on.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Half a fingers worth of audibly fizzy medium brown colored head which is slow to rise and then quickly fizzes away leaving a partial crescent of thin lace and a very minimal collar... A flat black color that allows the slightest bit of light to leak in around the glass... Quite still... A bit of sediment settles at the bottom of the glass... 		S - Rich roasted malts... Coffee... Chocolate... Caramel... The aromas compliment one another quite well which adds to the nice complexity of this offering... 		T - The roasted malt is dominate throughout... Also present are highlights of caramel, coffee, and chocolate... A very subtle hop bite on the finish... 		M - On the lighter side of full bodied... Sleek... Dense... Light carbonation... Chalky finish... 		D - Another rock solid offering from Founders... Spot on in terms of style... No real short comings... Amongst the best American Porters out there and something all BAs should seek out and try... This is welcome in my glass any night...";;;;;;;;;;
"On cask at a local bar		A - Pours with a ruby red body with a , toffee caramel thick 2 finger head. 		S- lots of roasted malts, toffee, grains and a very noticeable nutty quality		T- Very creamy and moreish, lots of maltiness, toffee again, a hazelnut quality lingers on the tongue well after the swallow. A nice alcoholic kick on the finish aswell. I found this hard to believe it was 5.1abv, felt more like a 6.5-7% due to the warm alcoholic feel.		M - Medium carbonation, creamy and thick, very moreish.		D - I would have to say this is my favourite cask ale to date, was a super unexpected surprise for me. Im not a lover of scottish ale but this has made me want to persue more examples of the style more. This was a lovely winter warmer beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"I was thrilled to get this one in a trade recently as I had been wanting to try it, but alas we do not get any of their wonderful offerings around here. I had cellared this one for about six months before opening the 12 ounce bottle last night, just to let it mellow out as it was a fresh 2007 when I	received it. Served at cellar temperature into a snifter, I was thrilled to begin sampling this one. The pour was very nice with a rusty, ruby colored, almost candy like reddish amber color being presented in front of me. There was a touch of haze to it, but not as much as I expected. Some light carbonation could be seen struggling up to reach the surface. There was a decent sized two finger head of white that caressed the top of it and hung out for a good bit before settling down to just a thin crown and leaving behind some scorching side glass lace. Very nice look for a Barley wine, 		The aroma was very pleasing, with loads of sugar coming at me almost at once. There was some very complex aromas mingling around in here for sure. Some tobacco was clearly evident, giving it a musky sort of aroma, light hints of alcohol, candied sugar and apples coming through. As it warmed some hints of an oaky sort came out. The flavor was really well done I have to admit. Super smooth, with just the lightest of carbonation, it struggled not to tip too far into the syrup side of things, but	may have in fact landed there in the end. Very sweet, with hardly any alcohol being noticed in here, I was quite impressed. Rich candied apple notes were abound in here, with hints of caramel and honey as well. Some light floral notes in the finish, and that musky tobacco like taste, that I could almost construe to be a weird type of spice to be honest. As it warmed any trace of the alcohol was gone, and it became a syrup laden sweet candied treat. I was sipping along on this for a good long while mainly due to the complex flavors, but it surely would not be a session ale. This was a very nice way for me	to wrap up my evening as I would have loved to have had another one right after it.		Overall this was easily my favorite I have had from them so far. It is a very solid offering for sure, and one of the better barley wines I have had lately. Very sweet with a nice hidden quality to it. This definitely falls into the must try category.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Pours a thick, syrupy, hazy opaque amber color that produces a small eggshell (almost yellow) head that retains for a very short amount of time and leaves a tiny spotted lacing along the glass. Nice appearance so far.		S: Very dark fruity and malty. Raisins, tons of molasses, caramel, figs and I'm even getting some dates. Nice hop bitterness and slight floral aroma, but definitely malt dominant. 		T: Very very similar to the nose, except a little less fruity. Not much else to say, still nicely balanced with an assertive hop bitterness and a firm malt backbone.		MF/D: Amazingly viscous mouthfeel. Smooth, velvety, creamy, and simply perfect in my book. Carbonation is spot on as well. Highly drinkable, just don't chug a sixer";;;;;;;;;;
"Single, twelve-ounce bottle just copped from Super Saver Liquors in Somerville...	Stoudts usually produces top-notch brews, so I had rather high hopes for this Autumn seasonal...	Appearance: An aggressive pour yielded a ruddy, tawny, medium-orange, copper hue with a decent-sized foamy head that soon receded and deposited a thin film of lacing around the edge of the serving glass...	Smell: Excellent, true-to-the-style Oktoberfest aroma bursting with malts, amber, grains, caramel, and a tinge of vanilla...	Taste: Creamy, rich, thick flavor, strongly complementing the aroma... Strong malt backbone, hints of vanilla, caramel, copper thrown into the mix...	Mouthfeel: Medium-to-thick bodie dmouthfeel... Creamy and chewy with rich malts and a great level of drinkability...";;;;;;;;;;
"Described as a ""strong dubbel"", this beer is a collaboration between three female brewers: Megan Parisi (CBC), Whitney Thompson (Victory) and Laura Ulrich (Stone). 		This beer pours a dark, nearly crimson red color with a thin head into my tulip.		Plum and saffron come to mind in the aroma. The saffron adds a new dimension to it.		Come to think of it, it is somewhat acidic like an orange. There's only a hint of plum/raisin.		The mouthfeel is warm and the texture is different as noted because it doesn't just slosh down like a typical dubbel. The addition of orange blossom honey mellows it out.		I feel that dubbels are hard to pin down but the willingness of all 3 brewers to find a common ground makes this example so much more. You owe it to yourself to try this the next time you're at CBC!";;;;;;;;;;
"Dudes ... THIS is one SMACK YOU UPSIDE YOUR HEAD kind of brew! Think about it - creamy white frothy head floating on a golden nectar of alocholic splendor. Then it hits you - HOPS and ALCOHOL are what this brew is all about! YEAH!!		Heavy handed in both? ... FREAKIN'-A YEAH! DOUBLE-ly so! Dude - If you're not a hop head, STEP AWAY ... NOW! Also - If you want to have this with FOOD?! ... STEP AWAY ... NOW! This is one chalice of DELICIOUSNESS that better be savored one sip at a time! (OR ELSE!!) Slow n' easy ... savoring the crazy goodness of the liquid hops...Sorry - I really *Love* this brew. 		Kudos to Spooner for the intro ... 		Miss you, dude.		Cheers!";;;;;;;;;;
"22oz bottle, poured straight out of the 50F cellar.		A: poured out jet black with a tan head. head faded quickly. 		S: smells of roasted malt, coffee, hints of chocolate, vanilla. i dont get much bourbon. as it warms i do get a little more bourbon and a cocoa in the nose.		T: it is somewhat sweet. i get coffee and chocolate, and roasted malt. there are hints of vanilla. i dont get much in the way of bourbon, there is a slight booziness in the finish that has hints of bourbon. 		M: it is thinner than i would have liked. mouthfeel is thin to medium. the carbonation is low, which i like. 		D: it is very smooth and quite drinkable. it is not a bad beer at all, i was just hoping for a little more bourbon punch. maybe i dont get much bourbon since i just had a glass of scotch. who knows.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottled 9/22/11		A - Pours clear golden brown with one finger of white head. Head doesn't last long but leaves some nice lacing.		S - Big aroma of resinous pine hops up front, also quite grassy and some pineapple. Eventually some biscuit malts come through as well. Nice aroma.		T - Similar to smell there is a big pine hops taste up front, accompanied by some grass and some florals. Biscuit malt appears midway, while the hops continue throughout the taste, leading to a nice bitter finish.		M -- Medium oily mouthfeel. Finish is somewhat dry and bitter.		O - A very good wet hopped IPA. Hop component is substantial but not overwhelming. I look forward to a 4 pack of this each year.";;;;;;;;;;
"2007 bomber into a pint glass, celebrating the completion of my 192-pg. Master's Thesis.		Pours a thick, hazy, copper-amber body with a thin taupe head that disspiates quickly to a ring of bubbles. The carbonation sluggishly rises through this one, and yet the head still manages to leave some decent lacing. Rich notes of floral hops, bready, caramel malts, brown sugar, tropical fruits, and a buttery alcohol note. Amazingly complex and intoxicating, and I haven't even taken a sip!		Bitter hop oils coat the tongue with floral notes and resin, while a spicy yeast esther in the middle adds some breadiness and fruit. The malt seems a bit outbalanced, but the hops are done well enough for me not to care. The body is gooey and thick, with an invigorating alcohol bite to the finish that pairs with a lingering bitter hop note. I'm glad I was able to bring this bottle home with me from Seattle...well worth the asking price and definately one I would seek out again.";;;;;;;;;;
"The beer poured into the glass a slightly hazy golden amber with a low off-white head which lasted well to lace the glass.		The aroma was malty and fruity with some citrus and grassy hop aromas that were pleasant and not overpowering.		The flavor was very well done with a nice citrusy and slightly grassy hop bittering and flavor that balanced well with the caramel malty flavors. The flavor was fruity, but not overly so and the beer was well thought out. The hop flavor in the beer just keeps on giving, but never seems out of step or overly harsh.		The finish was dry with lasting hop flavors and bittering into the afteraste with malt backbone keeping the bittering from overpowering in the end. The body was medium and well done. A darn nice IPA.		12 ounce bottle purchased at Riley's in Madison, WI.";;;;;;;;;;
12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours deep brown and settles black with about 1.5cm of dark tan head. Pretty good lacing at least at the beginning of the drink and great carbonation for the genre. Taste is toffee and chocolate with a sharp end that touches a bit too alcoholic. Mouthfeel leaves something to be desired as it thins throughout. A good stout by stoudts, but I prefer some of there other offerings.;;;;;;;;;;
"This is a peculiar can, because it says ""canned by Staropolski brewery"" on the front, there's no mention of Okocim (previous brewers of Zagloba Premium). I'm guessing Carlsberg sold the name/recipe to Staropolskie. The branding is completely different from Okocim's, no ""Premium"" on the label, but Mocne in big letters. 		Poured this into a half-liter Weizen glass, and the head came about 1/2"" short of the rim. Dull golden amber tone, with steady visible carbonation. 		After a few minutes, the aroma opened up more, and it was primarily sweet malt, a hint of apple, and light alcohol too. 		Malty flavors with a touch of apple from the yeast. Papery notes. Surprisingly, it finishes pretty clean, with an apple aftertaste lingering throughout. Carbonation gives it ample body, and it's fairly easy to drink despite a moderate sweetness. 		This can was $.99, and it was pretty decent considering this is Poland's version of Malt Liquor.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured into a Duvel tulip glass.;;App- A hazy golden honey color. With an aggressive pour a 3 finger head developed but settled quickly. Very artistic lacing down the glass.;;Smell- Great smell. Grapefruit & pine notes.;;Taste- The bitterness is very pronounced. Initial mild malt sweetness leads to citrus on the back mixing with the bitter at the finish.;;Mouth- Medium bodied with a decent carb level. ;;Drink- Very good. A great example of a DIPA.
Poured a very clear copper/amber with a little head. Not a ton of aroma, I hoped for more. Semi fruity citrus hops. Taste is similar with the citrus hops, sweet malts. I could use a little more body on it but overall mouthfeel was good with a nice carbonation level and this beer went down very smooth and easily. I would buy this often if I could.;;;;;;;;;;
"Blunderbuss poured a deep rosewood brown with a thin light beige head that left some lacing on the glass. The aroma was floral hops, mace, apricots, caramel, and some evergreen notes. The taste started with a bold combination of caramel malt, mild brown sugar, and fig flavors. It then moves on to blend more flavors of pear, clove, and citrus along with the original flavors into a wonderful balanced complexity of goodness. The finish is smooth with a nice alcohol warmth balanced with malt and mace flavors and a hint of hop bitterness trying to make an appearance. Aftertaste is a sigh and a grin. Mouthfeel is a smooth medium full body that is a pleasure to watch swirl in the snifter (or maybe that's the alcohol that makes the swirls so pretty).	Overall a very nice Barley Wine that is well balanced with plenty of complexity and alcohol warmth. Well worth going out of your way for one.";;;;;;;;;;
"reviewed from notes	This is aged for 1 year before I cracked it open... Let's see how we did...		This is the best pumpkin beer I've ever had.	Glowing orange, translucent body. Thin whitish head quickly subsided to a thin cloud of bubbles leaving behind some spotty lacing.	The nose is HUGE pumpkin flesh... Then some cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, and a touch of dry alcohol.	The taste is pumpkin pie in a blender. The flavor is everything I would want from a pumpkin beer. Huge flavors of pumpkin and spice with a lightly sweet malt base.	As we warm up I get a little nuttiness, pecans perhaps?		Decently sweet all the way through.		Mouthfeel is nice and holds good carbonation despite the poor head on the pour.		I generally don't like pumpkin beers, but this is the best I've had-- of course, that ONLY goes for an aged bottle! Fresh I was less than impressed!";;;;;;;;;;
"Cloudy burnt orange in color. Leaves a good off-white head. Large amounts of lacing	 Notes of malt & hops. A little fruit, citrus possibly. 	 Very robust hop character. Melds to a malty sweet middle. Medium bodied. Highly bitter & dry finish.	 Very well done! I like the big malt character that it poses in the middle & the crazy bitterness that this brew posseses.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a deep, clear burnt caramel. Head is khaki colored and foamy. 	Aroma is of landjager, malt, charcoal, and burnt brown sugar.		Taste is of pork fat and charcoal smoke. Very reminiscent of spiced German sausage. Malt is relevant but not aggressive, creating a slightly thinner than desired mouthfeel, but supporting the smoky flavors.		This does not have a high drinkability due to the true potency of the intense smoked meat flavor, (drinkable, but not a session beer or anything), but I've gone back several times to buy more, so it certainly is a beer that makes you want to return to it again and again. Gets extra drinkability points for this. Also, this would be awesome with some grilled hot brats.		For the style, and excellent example -- good to have every once in a while when you're in the mood.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a pure white, large, fluffy head composed of tiny bubbles that give a presentation of a very pillowy top. Several minutes pass before the foam has left some good lacing along the sides of the glass and has descended to thin film atop the beer. The body itself is the color of golden hay and is transparent with a fair amount of visible carbonation.	The aroma is crisp and clear, though a bit faint, displaying pilsener malt and floral hops with minor traces of yeast and a lemon-citrus. Taste is clean, bearing strong marks of fresh malt and a bit of yeastiness with hints of lemon and a fair amount of bitterness from the hops. The aftertaste is largely of malt and bears some biscuit flavor as well.	The palate detects a fair amount of carbonation, quite suitable and not overly intense, resonating well with the moderate thickness of the body. 	Finish is clean and dry, nicely rounding out this quality German pilsener. Refreshing and highly drinkable, one to revisit when possible.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Brilliant, clear deep amber with a fluffy off-white head that has decent retention and lacing.		S - Good, but a bit unconventional for the style with grassy, floral hops in the forefront with the big sweet caramel malts in the background.		T - Caramel malts, a touch of dark fruit, then the hops come in with earthy floral and pine notes. Finishes with just a touch of roastiness.		M - On the heavy side of a medium body, medium carbonation. Finishes clean.		D - Scarily drinkable. If you want more hops in a dopplebock, this is your beer. I would defnitely buy this again.";;;;;;;;;;
"Single of Founder's Black Rye picked up at Colonial Spirits in Acton, MA. 		Appearance...The brew looks as a dark brown/black color, almost completely opaque. Good amount of tan colored head...dissapates to a nice thick lace around the rim that sticks to the glass.		Aroma...Earthy, which must be coming from the rye. Also of hops, a slight aroma of roasted coffee.		Flavor...The first two flavors that come right across are that of some nice hops and lots of roasted coffee. The aroma does not lie. Burnt coffee and caramel-ly taste. This is definitely a beer of the earth- the rye comes across in combination with the burnt coffee.		Mouthfeel...Full, bitter/hoppy, and dry.		Drinkability...Tasty but not overpowering, full but not too filling. Would be even better on a cold night in front of a roaring bonfire. Even in the summer, I'll take another...";;;;;;;;;;
"The BBC Bourbon Barrel Stout is a really nice barrel aged double stout that is dangerously drinkable given its high abv. I had this on tap one night at the downtown Louisville brewpub and it was absolutely amazing. Out of the bottle it's less impressive, but still a very good stout for the roasted & chocolate malt fan in all of us.		The beer pours opaque black with a minimal tan head that quickly fades and leaves no lacing. It smells of semi-sweet chocolate and vanilla with roasted malt and a hint of bourbon. The malt flavors are complex but fleeting. Chocolate, coffee and vanilla intermingle. It has a medium light body and light carbonation, yet still achieves a smooth mouth feel. The finish is surprisingly crisp and leaves a very mild chocolate and bourbon aftertaste.		Overall, the BBC Jefferson Reserve is just a very drinkable and enjoyable stout. Smooth and very mellow, without any harshness. It sort of makes me want to break out a good cigar, sit on the porch and watch it rain.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Rich and golden with little head and no lacing		S: Light floral aroma		T: Very clean. Slight malty sweetness giving way to a clean end. Some floral aspects to the taste.		M: Dry finish. Very filling in the mouth. Not oily, but has more of a porter creaminess.		D: Very drinkable.		Overall: There are a lot of APAs that I wish were like this. Not to knock the macro-brews, but if they were more like this I'd certainly drink them more frequently. I think APAs get lower scores than other styles on average, but this was pleasant.";;;;;;;;;;
"served on tap @ Flying Saucer, Kansas City, MO		Pours a brown shade of brown that is all brown and looks brown. Seriously, it was pretty basic looking. It doesn't look like an imperial stout, not really. Its brown with reddish edges. The lion's-pelt head was small and didn't lace well at all. This beer is nearly a year old, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. 		This needs to be a candle. Seriously. First up to tingle the nose senses is the familiar, well-executed espresso aroma from the standard Breakfast Stout (though not featured in the same level of strength as it is in FBS). Smooth vanilla works its way through the coffee as the beer quickly warms, eventually opening up to include the maple syrup that one looks forward to when having this beer. Some slightly sour wood scents provide a backbone to it all. Though not too complex, it smells great.		After the first swallow, the preeminent thought in my mind was that this beer isn't harsh at all. No trace of alcohol, no harsh whiskey barrel characteristics, no fusels finding their way up to the nostrils. This beer is smooth, smooth, smooth. I don't know what CBS tasted like fresh, but I'm attributing the smoothness to the nearly one year of aging. CBS has less coffee flavor than FBS but that's backed up by vanilla sweetness and rich, silky malts. The Canadian rye whiskey barrel flavors are delicious. I'm usually not in love with whiskey/bourbon/brown spirit flavors (in beer or otherwise), but this is simply the best brown spirit flavor in a beer that I've ever had. The balance is impeccable; this is a sweet beer, yes, but never cloying.		This aged pour of CBS was unquestionably thinner in mouthfeel than FBS (also consumed on-tap tonight). I missed the thickness, frankly, but given the increase in residual sweetness maybe the thinner feel is a good thing. Regardless, its definitely not a negative in any sense. Drinkability has to be scored well. Its high in ABV%, sure, but you always want more of this after the glass is finished. I sure wish that I could have had more.		I wasn't able to have very much of this great beer in what was my first, best and probably last chance to sample it. I'm so glad that I was able to drink what I did. Remarkable balance, tasty flavors, what's not to love? I haven't had Kentucky Breakfast Stout to compare, but its hard for me to see KBS being much better than its Canadian brother.";;;;;;;;;;
"After driving through WV on my way back and forth to OH so many times, I finally decided to stop and look for some WV brew. It's a state I haven't knocked off yet. All they had at the place I stopped was this, and their Nut Brown Ale. I went with the lager because sometimes I just want a mild no-nonsense beer. Something I don't have to think much about. So here goes...		12oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass. Pours a super pale gold with about a finger-width of bone-white head on top. Dissipates to just a ring around the edge. Some light lace sticks around. The nose is mild and basic. Some light lemon citrus, grains, and dry husk. The mouth is light with ample carbonation. Refreshing feel. The flavor is about what I expected. Honey, lemon zest, white bread, and a mild soapy aftertaste. Light hops on the back end. This, as others have already stated, would make a great ""converter"" for the macro crowd. But I enjoyed it still. It accomplished what I got it for: it's refreshing and simple.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to Trevor (advent) for this!		Bottled 12/07/09, poured into a tulip.		Pours a pale copper color that looks wonderful. Nice, white, soapy head that creates a nice amount of filmy laces.		May not have been the freshest, but still had a good amount of citrus, pine, bitterness and resiny sweetness.		Citrus explosion on the taste, with lingering bitterness, with a wonderful bouquet of floral notes. Had this have been only a few weeks or so old, I think this would cross the exceptional mark. 		Sits a tad heavier than most. Still great, but a bit more crispness would have been wonderful. Had this have been a DIPA, the feel would be spot on.		Great drinkability. Wish I had more than 1!";;;;;;;;;;
"22oz draft, at the jet rock in the Philadelphia airport		appearance: nice bright copper appearance, clear with a light beige cap and a touch of lacing		smell: citrus hops, grassy and earthy traits, caramel malts, toasted grain - nothing over the top but very clean and encouraging		taste: nice and refreshing after an 8 hour flight from barcelona - toasted grain, citrus hops. Nothing plays too big of a role and this turns out as a solid, very drinkable pale ale - just the way it should be		mouthfeel: medium, moderate carbonation		drinkability: good";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at Brazenhead of all places. Not my favorite bar but usually where we wind up after work.		Arrives with a small cap of white foam with pretty good retention. The bar is pretty damn dark inside, but the beer appears a light copper/gold color. Leaves amazing lace that started as a blanket more than halfway down my glass.		I really loved the way this smells. Faint pine hops which are buffeted by a strong floral and herbal aroma. Getting notes of sweet chamomile and earl grey floralness.		My initial reaction was that this was a really sweet IPA. As I drank the sweetness died somewhat, but juicy floral hops and a sweeter malt bill make this a tastey brew. Some pine can be found but sweet ruby grapefruit steals the show. Bitterness is assertive but very drinkable.		Well carbonated, but this suits the style well. Fairly crisp, some hop resins slick the beer as it is in the mouth, but it finishes slighly dry.		This is a wonderful beer and one I'd be happy drinking several of in a sitting.";;;;;;;;;;
On tap, 10 ounce sample at Maduro's in Madison WI, served in an Aecht Schlenkerla glass. This beer has a hazy brown color topped with a small head. As the beer was set in front of me, I immediately smelled smoked malt, fruit, and a hoppy aroma that I didn't expect from this beer. The hoppiness worked quite well, however. The flavor is a meaty smokiness with caramel, fruit, and hops. Malty, but not too sweet. The fruitiness and hoppiness made this beer quite different from the other beers made by this brewery. Mouthfeel is not too heavy. Drinkability is superb. My glass was finished much too quickly. This is mighty tasty stuff.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured bottle into glass.		Appearance: Poured practically black, and had a small, light brown head that lingered with some lacing. Simply put, it looks delicious.		Smell: Had a chocolate aroma with some coffee in the background. 		Taste: The smell of coffee in the background really comes to the forefront in the taste. The chocolate is able to hold its own as well. It almost tasted like a carbonated mocha. 		Mouthfeel: Very thick and rich. Quite robust. 		Drinkability: Now, don't get me wrong...based on the taste alone, I could drink this beer non-stop. However, I found it to be so filling that I don't think I could drink more than two (or at most three) in one sitting. It is so good, though, that I could see myself keeping a pack on hand to have one for desert or something as it's that good.";;;;;;;;;;
A- Pours a deep amber/copper color with a thick off white foam head that leaves some lacing.;;S- Rich sweet bourbon aroma.;;T- Huge rush of bourbon whiskey flavor. Nice vanilla bean and oak flavors are present in the finish along with a strong sting of alcohol.;;M- Creamy feel with nice carbonation and a medium/full body. The alcohol was a bit too strong for my tastes.;;D- Overall this beer tastes just like I expected. This seems to be Dirty Bastard aged in bourbon barrels and that is exactly what I got.;;
"Poured into snifter forms a one finger khaki head. Very large bubbled almost like fine styrofoam, falls quickly leaving some patchwork on the top of the chestnut edged void that is my glass.		Sweet dark fruits with not quite dark chocolate, slight booze but very light, light buttercookie smell, a little lighter of a smell than what I was expecting.		Taste is chocolate and caramel up front with bitter coffee towards the end. In the middle there are quick bursts of dark fruit doing battle with the 9% booziness. Hop presense is spot on for my taste in the style, enough to balance it out but not enough to take away from the malts flavor.		Feel is wonderful, not so thick as to be heavy but heavy enough to let you know this is no Porter. Drinkability is high with this one due to it being doable with ABV and with it not being a slight version of Turkish coffee.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Looks like a well steeped glass of sweet tea with not much going on up top. 		S - Likely had the best aroma of any pumpkin brew I've had. Vibrant spicing with well pronounced supporting scents.		T - 1st thing that hits me is a weak Bourbon taste followed by fairly well thought out spicing with a good measure of nutmeg, clove, allspice and pumpkin.		M - Full bodied with zesty carbonation and a touch of sweet aftertaste.		O - I felt this was probably the best thought out pumpkin brew I've had. Good balance and tasty.";;;;;;;;;;
"This beer has a red colour with a good, long-lasting head. The smell is hoppy with a hint of breadiness. 		The first thing you taste is fruity hops. The aftertaste comes on slowly and doesn't have much bitter kick. The rye is noticeable here. This beer has good carbonation and so it has some volume in the mouth. A very nice brew.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Golden Yellow was an amazing head that retains and leaves a ring of lacing around the side of the glass. Mild carbonation.		Smell: Hints of citrus, grass, hay, floral. A good blend of fine mellowing hops. Very distinctive czech flavoring. The sweetness is balanced by mild biscuit malts. Faint pale aromas. Slight skunk flavor that actually diminished as the beer sat in the glass.		Taste: Sharp grassy hop taste. Grainy. Metal? Light spicy flavors, sweet citrus notes. Good biscuit malt flavor helps to fill out the body of the beer. Finishes well. Fizzy. Good hop presence. A tad bitter. Light and easygoing.		Mouthfeel: The metal taste turns me off but the rest of the beer is a solid light bodied blend of czech hops and good malts. Finishes with a slighty bitterness. A great session beer.		Overall: Maybe not as good as it used to be but still as fine drinkable Pilsner. The hop style has a lot of character. A good introduction to European beers for a new beer drinkable, definitely preferable to Heineken or Becks. It can usually be found at an affordable price.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - It pours in an exceptionally picturesque manner. Never have I seen a cask beer look so good. The brown body proudly boasts a generous crown of off-white frothy head. I am astounded.		S - Amazing, fantastic, beyond superlative. Delectable notes of cocoa and vanilla mingle with a rich maltiness and a bright grassy-leafy hop bitterness. 		T - This beer is loaded with complexity and subtlety; it is also the picture of balance. The earthy, leafy, grassy and resiny hop is very forward in the mix, but the malt is ample and sturdy. Notes of rich malt meld into nuances of vanilla and cocoa, and the hop segues from bitter to more herbal as the glass empties.		M - Velvety and luxurious, with ample brightness and effervescence. The best cask I've ever had.		D - I would drink many a pint of this if I lived in Indianapolis.";;;;;;;;;;
"I'm pretty much reviewing this as an imperial oatmeal stout. I have yet to have an oatmeal stout that I've really, really liked. The characters have never quite melded too well for me.	THIS fellow... the oatmeal serves to soften some of the hit-you-over-the-head aspects of high alcohol stouts. The coffee and chocolate flavors are rich, but think of a good bowl of oatmeal with generous amounts of cocoa powder mixed in. 	While I might prefer other ""double stouts"" over this one, as an oatmeal stout this rocks. Breakfast indeed.";;;;;;;;;;
"22 oz bottle poured into my snifter- my first hoppin' frog review-despite its wide availability in the burgh.		A-Body is an opaque, thick black hue. Pours with no head at all-then an elusive dark mocha colored foamy head bubbles up quickly to about 1/2 finger then fades away just as quickly as it enters but leaves a thin collar. No lacing in the glass.		S- Smell is great and very typical of an IRS. Anise, molasses, roasted malt, oatmeal, and just a hint of phenols make up an excellent balance.		T-Flavor is good but not as complex and balanced as the nose. Upfront is a mostly roasted malt flavor with overtones of licorice and vanilla sweetness. The finish is similar to the initial flavor with the whole profile intensifying a bit. Roasted malt/ coffee tones are definitely the main character of the brew though other characteristics can be detected in the background. What lingers on the palate is a moderate roasted malt bitterness. 		M-Medium to high carbonation and a mouthfeel that is thick and viscous.		D- This brew is packed with a lot of BIG flavor and this hybrid seems to line up better with the coffee imperial stouts than the IRS's- though this brew does contain some distinctive IRS character. The ABV is pretty well hidden under the big flavor of this brew. It is a good imperial stout overall and I like the idea of an IRS/oatmeal hybrid. Optimally, for me this brew would have a little bit less roasted malt character and more balance. The ABV is pretty well hidden under the big flavor of this brew.";;;;;;;;;;
"From the mixed six case I picked up at the Costco in Bloomingdale.		Pours a nice caramel amber color with a one finger head that dwindles to nothing after a sip or two. 		Good toasted malt aroma makes me think of sweet white bread and a little dry caramel. 		Very simple ,and a litle watery, toasted malt upfront. The middle has some caramel and white bread crust, but this flavor dissipates quickly. This finish is a very soft sweet malt and a little earthen hop musk. 		The palate is a little watery and then powdery, but still pretty sessionable.";;;;;;;;;;
"pours out a light amber/orange and very clear with just a small amount of white suds.	Smell is grapefruit and orange peel with and an aroma from some very nice hops.	Taste is very dry grapefruit with orange and cherry. That is where the bitterness ends cause of the sweet aftertaste. Carmel sugars abound here.	Mouthfeel is a little oily but not as much as a better IPA.	Good session brew here. Founders has some gems and some turds, this is in the middle there somewhere.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Black and beautiful. 1 finger reddish brown head that fades quickly into thin lacing. Held up to light, cannot see through it. 		S - Coffee and Booze.. Slight whiff of vanilla . 		T - Coffee, Bourbon, Sweet, Goes in your mouth, into your nose, and warms everything. 		M - Surprisingly smooth, coats the inside of your mouth well, and warms everything it touches. 		D - If this were readily available It would be a wonderful go to beer to always drink.";;;;;;;;;;
"A. Body is a dark reddish brown with a thin brownish head that has good retention and lacing. The carbonation is also good on this beer.	S. The smell is candied apples, coffee, oak, sugar, and caramel.	T. The taste is apples, bananas mixed with coffee, oak, caramel, some pine along with a nutty apple after taste. The taste is sweet with some bitterness at the end and in the aftertaste, but balanced.	M. This medium bodied beer has a nice sticky mouthfeel to it. It reminds me of eating candy and getting a stickiness in the mouth from it. 	D. A nice drinkable beer that goes down easily, could sip on this or drink it in one swallow with no problem. I will be getting more of this beer in the future.";;;;;;;;;;
"I bought this one on line because:	1, it's not available here and 	2, because of some very strong input I've read about the quality of this IPA.		In a nutshell, this is THE best tasting IPA I've ever tasted. As a result, I could do nothing but give it a perfect 5. I mean, if one cannot find any negative aspects to a beer, why NOT give it a perfect 5 score? 		Best regards,	Bill";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Clear brown. Would have like to have seen more reddish color. Head dissipates after about 2 minutes.		Smell: Malty scent with earthy tones. Barely floral. A hint of fruit (banana?). Not very strong aroma.		Taste: Mild. Slightly sweet. Malty. Grains have that taste like rice/sorghum (see also: New Grist from Lakefront Brewery). The main drawback of the taste is an ""earthy"" flavor that hits the roof of your mouth. . Slightly bitter aftertaste.		Drinkability: Really pretty good, despite that slight funk in the aftertaste.";;;;;;;;;;
"This is a very nice English beer, a bit tart for a brown ale, but a nice beer nonetheless. Riggwelter means a sheep overturned, and hence the graphic on the label. The beer pours a dark clear ruby color with a very nice tan head that retains very well and laces. There is a creaminess to the head that seques into more of a foamy presence. The nose on the beer is sweet malts, some hop bite, some raisiny aromas as well. There is an earthy quality to this beer. 		The taste is a tad musty, a full palate of roasted malts, some raisin like flavors, and an astringency that knocks things down a few points. There is a slight dryness in the finish, but overall this is a sweet roasted beer with some dark chocolate and charred flavors. The beer is more creamy than crisp, it has some hop leafy bitterness, and then there is the astringency. The mouthfeel is a tad oily and the aftertaste is quite noticeable roasted maltiness and bitterning hops. This beer is worth seeking out.		Re-review June 2010: This beer has a lot more caramel flavors, lots more malted toffee, and lots more pale malt flavors. There is less astringency for sure. There some leafy hop in the background, some very subtle charred flavors. This beer just got bumped up a notch. It is quite good.";;;;;;;;;;
"I just opened a fresh bottle from this year into a DFH pint glass. It poured a rich, smooth amber. There was a light cream colored head which sat on top of the beer. It smells delicious. It is VERY VERY hoppy and somewhat floral. It has both bitter and sweet accents. Excellent IPA smell and very smooth. The taste is excellent as well. The first thing that comes to mind is sweetness. The sweetness definitely covers up the 12% abv. The hoppiness is subtle and smooth. It is very floral. The mouthfeel is astonishing for an IPA. It is very smooth and creamy, the carbonation is present yet mellow. This beer goes down very smoothly. I think this is the most drinkable 12%er I've ever had. It has great aromas and flavor and is very smooth going down. The Devil Dancer is excellent and a great beer. I recommend the DD to all.		Update: The 2011 version smells and tastes of pure caramelized onions. It's hard to stomach and not nearly the beer it has been in the past. If I were to re-rate the beer I'd certainly give it a grade higher than a D.";;;;;;;;;;
This one pours a very dark ruby that is almost completely opaque. There is a fingers worth of a cream colored head with foamy lacing. The nose offers burnt caramel malts with some roasted malt as well. a bit boozey after a long whiff. The taste is of butterscotch up with some roasty malts. A well blended biscuit flavor is noticed right before the 8.5% is noticed. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation, creating a smooth feel. Because this brew is very smooth and tasty, with a well hidden ABV, downing many of this will not be an issue. Drink UP!;;;;;;;;;;
"A thin, dark beige head sits atop a deep cordovan, cloudy beer. Some oily lace clings to the glass. Finally only a bubbly ring remains.		A light aroma of caramel, herbal hop, and a hint of citrus and floral. Simple, appealing.		Medium/full flavored, starting with a sweet dark caramel,some bready sweet, quickly joined by herbal bitter that balances well. It finishes with a hint of pine resin, and the sweet becoming more roasty, as the bitter sustains a nicely dry finish. As it warms, alcohol adds some spicy vapors.		Mouthfeel is medium body, lightly carbonated, quite viscous without a lot of resin buildup, and an excellent finish. Creamy, silky feel to it.		Dirty Bastard is supremely drinkable. I could drink this until Earth resembles Mars.		Impression: So glad Founders is here in NY State. This beer is crafted beautifully, is delicously drinkable and refreshing for a big beer. Get this if you see it.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured from a bottle overflowing with foam into my New Belgium globe glass. It is a ruby/almost black and started off with a tan, creamy head that just didn't last very long, although leaving a chunky lacing. Could have fooled me into believing that this was a stout. My first whiff of this hit me as if I had a glass full of bacon. The more my nose gets acclimated, the more I smell the dark, sweet malts and some herbal hops. Tastes like a campfire with a sweet, malty backbone and good bittering hops in the finish. Kind of hard to pick out complexities in this as the smoke is so forceful, although the malt is sturdy enough not to let the smoke completely take over. Alcohol becomes a bit apparent as it warms. Still, this is tasty. Mouthfeel is creamy and does not weigh the tongue down. Delicious and unique beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance - Hazy pale gold with fluffy dense head. 		Smell - Rich and floral out the ass. 	 	Taste - Lemony and bit tart. Hops are subdued but present. Some grassiness as well. Malty very balanced. I figure this is a Southern style German pilsner due to lemoniness, maltiness and lower hops.		Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Layered mouthfeel somewhat reminiscent of a hefe-weizen.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pretty ironic, had this on tap at ITap instead of down at The Stables. Nice to see the beer luv being spread around. Their board listed this at 5.2% abv.		Nice brew - poured into a standard shaker pint. Clear and deep mahogany brown, but no head or lace on this one.		Subtle hints of sweet malt in the sniff, but the quaff kicked it up a notch with chocolate shake, caramel and hints of banana showing up for the party. Light body and smooth finish really round 'er out.		Easy going, tasty and sessionable - a nice brew for the cool fall/winter weather.";;;;;;;;;;
"My first Rauchbier, hey Josh, you have some serious catching up to do.		1 pt. 09 fl. oz poured into a stange.		Pours a dark ruby hue with a one finger light khaki colored head that dies down to a fluffy layer of bubbles. Spotty lacing is left on the sides of the glass. Smell is beef jerky and campfire smoke with a hint of sweet molasses. Lots of roasted grains and a bit of caramel malt in the nose as well. I have never smelled anything like this before, let's see how this one tastes. Taste begins with a smoked kielbasa that was cooked while tailgating truthfully in the parking lot of Ralph Wilson stadium. Midway a bit of brown sugar sweetness tickles the tongue, ending with a charred oak like aftertaste that's on the dry side. Medium to full body with a creamy smooth feel. Carbonation is fairly low, but fits the beer very well. This beer really improves as it warms, the flavors seem to be more pronounced. To be honest, before I even opened this bottle I wasn't sure if I would be able to finish this beer. I would be in heaven if Dinosaur BBQ downtown had this on hand. Drunken Spicy Shrimp, Tres Hombre, and Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen may just be the perfect combination...I may have to get another bottle of this and some Dinosaur take out VERY soon.";;;;;;;;;;
"A true porter indeed.	It pours dark black, nice tan head that cascades nice as you pour. The head maintains to lace somewhat from a moderate carbonated, full bodied brew. Though its not overly thick.		Aroma of dark roasted malts carry into the taste with dark chocolates, cocoa, charred wood, coffee and a toffee sweetness.		Easy on the mouth with a hop oil coat yet a slight burnt toast dryness.		A robust porter, well made.";;;;;;;;;;
"A- Pours a deep copper color with a tan froathy head that leaves nice layered lacing down the glass.		S- Smells of citrus hops that a balacned with a sweet malts. Smells just like you'd expect.		T- Tastes of sweet bready malt towards the front that gives way to an awesome citrus hop explosion with a ton grapefruit mixed with a sugary sweetness. Also has a nice pine bitterness in the finish.		M- Mouthfeel is sticky, oily with a nice bitter finish. Feels great.		D- This is a very good and extremely drinkable IPA. Recommended.";;;;;;;;;;
"Looks great in a pint glass.		Smell: bread, plum, chocolate, roastiness. very good.		taste: very similar to the smell, plus some of that imperial stout bitterness and slightly more plum than in the smell. i notice hops more in the aftertaste. overall extremely balanced and smooth.		Somewhat on the thick side.		Excellent stout. This is probably tied with ten fidy as my favorite imperial russian stout.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to a coworker for trading this bottle to me. She's a big IPA fan and this beer came well-recommended. 		Slightly clear with a moderate haze, medium orange. Two-finger off-white collapsed thin but retaining well with lacing. Pervasive tropical fruity hops, mango and pineapple. Supporting toasted malt makes an appearance, too. Mild herbal notes in the background. Moderate level of toasted malts, herbal hops, medium level of bitterness. Fruity hops sneak in the back-end Medium, dry finish with a lingering hop bitterness. Medium-light bodied with a moderate/moderate-high level of carbonation. 		Great hop nose and a well-formed flavor make this a good example of the IPA style. Could use more diversity in the flavor department.";;;;;;;;;;
"Aroma: Expected citrus notes of grapefruit rind with a certain grassy character. While the aroma in general is certainly hop focused, it isn't entirely bright. If you look for it you'll find some bread crust and caramel.		Appearance: Pours a deep copper, nearly red, with excellent clarity. Creme colored head rests thin but persistent. A trace of lacing sticks to the edge of the glass.		Flavor: Heavy hop flavor and bitterness upfront. More grapefruit dominating the palate with a hint of caramel malt making a showing here and there. Resinous hop flavor holds into the finish while bitterness bites the back of the throat. Hop resin sticks long into the finish with a near cloying tenacity.		Mouthfeel: Medium body with light carbonation. There is almost a foaming character in the mouth with the carbonation that creates palate fullness. Hop bitterness holds on to the roof of the mouth and back of the throat as chalky and resin.		Overall: For an IPA you're not shorted on the hop presence in bitterness, flavor, or mouthfeel. While the aroma rings true of an American IPA it comes off somewhat mottled and unfocused. Brighter hop aroma would be welcome and expected with all that flavor and bitterness. A fine selection for the hop lover while holding a delicate balance with the malt.";;;;;;;;;;
"This beer poured to be a very dark brown with a small amount of tan/mocha head.		The aroma to this beer consisted of malts, coffee, and a bit of chocolate.		Taste was rich and smooth and you could definitely taste the chocolate notes. Good carbonation with this beer.		I would definitely try this beer again.		Cheers!";;;;;;;;;;
Poured from a 500ml bottle into lager glass. Deep amber color, minimal head, which dissipated quickly (Note: glass was just rinsed out and wet from previous beer). Typical spiciness for a German Christmas beer. Lower alcohol content, but a smooth taste. Not so spicy to dissuade casual drinkers, but a nice tart aftertaste. No lacing on glass. I'd drink this year round if it was available...;;;;;;;;;;
"At DLD 2009, my favorite guest brew. Love this ten times more than KBS.		A- Dark. Slight brown head at the beginning.		S- Chocolate, roast, maple, whiskey.	T- Chocolate, roast, maple. LOL don't mean to repeat but this was a wonderful flavor. Think KBS but less coffee, and a little sweeter and thicker.		M- Thick. Coats the mouth and throat.		D- Yum wish I had more than 6-8oz		My favorite founders stout(and michigan brew).";;;;;;;;;;
"A well made Lager. Pours out to a bright golden yellow color with a well formed and bubbly 1/2 inch head, with some notes of lace in the glass. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of sweet aromatic malts was nice, but very weak. Taste was solid; flavors of soda crackers, malt and grains was very satisfying. Some sourness toward the finish. Mouthfeel was medium to medium light bodied with some zesty-ness toward the finish. Drinkability is good. I've become kind of disillusioned with micro lagers, as some have become very redundant and boring, but this one is a nice change up i'd like to have on hand. Recommended.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle received as extra from dashirey. Thanks a bunch! Poured into my Ayinger glass		A: Pours a gorgeous copper with a fluffy 1"" light brown head. Steady stream of carbonation and this one's very very pretty		S: Nose is sweet malts with plums, rum, raisin and molasses. 		T: Starts off a complex fruity sweet with just a hint of spiciness - nutmeg?mace? I can't quite put my finger on it. This is followed by a strange disappearance of the initially medium-body. The finish is what you'd expect for the style - you're palate is tickled by the malts and the alcohol is moderately drying		M: Apart from the disappearance of the body halfway through, this one's great		D: Oh boy - I could go for another";;;;;;;;;;
"Served from a pitcher into an imperial pint glass on 11/9/11 at McMenamins Imbrie Hall in Hillsboro, OR.		Dark, with a short lived head an little to no lace. Roasted malt aroma, coffee and chocolate, but not overwhelmingly strong. Very noticeable licorice flavor characteristics with bittersweet chocolate as a secondary flavor element. Big body and rich mouthfeel. Improves as it warms to near room temperature. There is a fair amount of sweetness and a mild bitter finish. Very similar in taste and feel to a low ABV imperial stout.";;;;;;;;;;
This doppelbock pours a clear, dark mahogany brown with tall, creamy, light brown foam that settles but clings a bit to the glass. The aroma is malty with notes of caramel, molasses, raisins, and figs. Very nice. The taste is lightly sweet and richly malty with flavors of chocolate, molasses, grape skins, roasted malt, a hint of hops buried deep, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat dry (light sweetness) with full body and modest carbonation feel. A dry, chocolatey, lightly bitter flavor lingers pleasantly. Overall a very nice, dark doppebock.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a pint glass. Bottle 4/23/09, enjoyued 8/13/09	A: Aggressive pour yields 2/3 finger thight white head with great retention. Chill hazy orange straw colored liquid. Pretty.	S: Man Candy! Pineapple, orange, grapefruit. Simcoe and Centennial? Slight hint of malt, whiff of aspirin.	T: Well rounded and balanced with a prick of bitterness finishing. Piney hop, bready malt with some buttered toast flavor. Twinge of fruity alcohol. Solid, tasty beer.	M: Sharp bitterness is slightly puckering	D: Session beer that has big hop aroma and well balanced flavor. I would order another and buy a sixer.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz can poured into a pint glass.		A - Clear copper/orange with eggshell head that left a little lacing.		S - Slightly nutty, floral hops, a little malt sweetness.		T - A nutty/slightly sweet richness that fades into citrus/floral bitterness.		M - Medium/Light, silky.		D - High, the silky mouthfeel is not only adds to the taste, but also makes this go down real easy.		Very nice, everyday drinking beer. Could give Mirror Pond a run for my ""fridge beer""";;;;;;;;;;
(12oz bottle courtesy of jcnd9803!). Pours hazy golden with white head. Aroma is huge grapefruit, mango and tropical fruits. Love it! Taste is sweet with big bright hops adding a pleasant layer of bitterness. Lighter bodied with slick texture and bitter finish. This is one great DIPA.;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a mahagony so dark that it verges on black, and is all but impenetrable by light once in the glass, with a small brown head. Smells of dark chocolate and burnt wood, with touches of alcohol (the fumes are masked but not completely hidden) and molasses sweetness. A very full body with a truckload of all the flavors that the nose picked up make for poetry on the palate. Goes great with my sharp cheese platter; would pair well with chocolate, or serve as night cap.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pouring this one with a lot of anticipation...completely opaque with a shallow dark tan head that fades fairly quickly to an obstinate ring. Evidence of some effervescence struggling unsuccessfully to keep the froth alive. Smells heavily roasted and dark chocolate. Deep silky smooth texture. First past was predominantly a whiff of dark chocolate with a lingering roast coffee chew on the tongue. As it warms slightly, and the aroma is deeper into the glass, the nose and taste are more of the coffee and oats. Almost a bitter cappuccino towards the end; demands your attention all the way. 		Sixpoint Bolshoi had a similar coffee 'take-away but not the same flavor and less intensity... to some degree sweeter. Southern Tier Jah-Va is altogether sweeter. All very good in my book.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Opaque black with a bit of ruby, small head and no lacing		Smell: Maple, vanilla, oak, toffee, caramel, booze, brown sugar, molasses. Very sweet.		Taste: Maple, molasses, toffee, brown sugar, caramel, oak.		Mouthfeel: Thick and filling.		Drinkability: Much higher than I expected, probably due to the sweetness.		Good beer, the best of the Breakfast Stout series Founder's has released. That said, it isn't a great beer, and certainly not one of the top ten beers in the world. I have always felt that limited, on-tap only releases tend to hype beer and inflate scores. This is a good example of that theory in action.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Pours a nice bright copper color with a thick pillowly white head. The head retention is strong and leaves some thick lacing.		S - The main aroma is the malt, however some deep inhales bring in the cinnamon and nutmeg.		T - The sweetness is definitely present in the taste. Nutmeg and cinnamon upfront with the malt in the background. Finishes only slightly bitter and leaves a nice sweetness on the tongue.		M - Light and airy.		D - This are very easy to drink and make me anticipate the upcoming holiday season.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured almost black with a thick brown head. Very good lace around the side of the glass. This beer needs time to sit before analyzing the aroma. There is various types of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, espresso, maple syrup and caramel. The maple syrup is brilliant. Taste is really complex with a powerful coffee taste which layers to various chocolates and vanilla and then to maple syrup. The caramel is in there throughout also. The taste sweetens as it goes down with more oatmeal in the aftertaste then the actuall taste. Mouthfeel is perfection with a great sweetness on the palate. Drinkability is very nice for the strength. This is quite filling and takes a while to drink yet it is still quite smooth.;;;;;;;;;;
"This one pours a pale golden color with a decent creamy off-white head that didnt stick around as long as I would have liked it too. The beer smells of beautiful floral hops with hints of oranges and lemons. Perfumy. The more and more I smell it, the more the orange and citrus scents really begin to stand out.		The flavor is loaded with hops. The malts are noticeable, but the hops rule this one. Citrusy and wonderful. Impressive. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied; nothing more, nothing less. Carbonation feels perfect. This beer is also easy to drink. Didnt take long to finish a pitcher at the local watering hole and leave a little buzzed... Another elite contender from Founders, great work guys!";;;;;;;;;;
"Fat Dog pours a onyx color leaving a thick tan head in its wake. The aroma is chocolate, oatmeal, caramel, sugar cookies, powdered milk, herbal hops in the back.		The taste mirrors the nose, coffee, butter toffee, herbs, aromatic hop presence, but not really bitter, but not too sweet either. There is light carbonation on the palate finishing bitter sweet, coffee in the end. Very nice.";;;;;;;;;;
"A rich and hefty, if not very good looking, DIPA.		Presentation: 12 oz brown bottle. Tongue in cheek cartoonish front label design with the illustration of a mirrored portrait. Shows a smudged bottling by date(01//10), which as per their website is bottled on December 21, 2009). Notes Alc. by Vol. (10%), and IBUs (86) Served into a tulip glass.		A - Pale to medium amber pour with a rather short head, poor retention, and minimal lacing with a poor surface memory. For the style, and for such a rich brew, the look is below average.		S - Very rich and complex hoppy nose. Citrus, grapefruit, resin, and pineapple... A predominant tropical fruit nose.		T - Taste follows the nose with rich hoppy sweetness, grapefruit, pine, and pineapple. Intiall malt that remains pushed to the back by the hoppy range. 		M - Medium body, medium carbonation, and a touch of a slightly dry finish.		D - A good DIPA, with a hefty hoppy profile, the alcohol is very well integrated and barely noticeable. 		Notes: I can understand the unnecessary hype putting this as the next best thing to Hopslam. Not that Founders needs any of the praise since it almost seems that they float above the ground. Mind you, it is an extraordinary brewery but nobody should scape from some critical analysis and Founders, good as they are, seems to get away with things others dont. This is not necessarily their fault but is surely due in part the cultural vibe that is building around them, at least in the region from where Im writing. Double Trouble is well above an average offering, and the nose is rather close to that of Hopslam, but the appearance is nowhere near it. Other than that it is a great DIPA without the hefty price tag, albeit not a cheap one either.";;;;;;;;;;
"Named after the Monty Python character, the tapper looks like it should have been used for the Monty Python Holy Grail Ale. Pretty cool, even if it does break a few copyrights.		Pours as good as you can get from a schwarz. Dark darkness with a solid chocolate-colored head.		Smells a lot stronger than most CB beers. Big on the malt, very sweet and very chocoately with hints of earth and smoke.		Tastes much stronger than most CB beers, and entirely free from the butteryness that plauges so much of their output! Starts with huge chocolate malt, which gives way to huge and crisp smokey sweet earthen malt and end with a kick of cane sugar. 		A good beer from an underlooked brewpub. I hope they keep this one around for a while!		EDIT:		I am a drunken moron. This beer should of course be called ""Dark Knight""";;;;;;;;;;
"This pours black with ruby highlights and an off-white head. 		There are strong roasted notes, vanilla, and coffee in the nose with a faint hint of toffee.		The first sip is super smooth and leaves a nice coating on the tongue. There is a huge roasted character and it is complex malt bill. This has a big mouthfeel with a slight acrid taste from the darker malts.		Lots of coffee and a nice bitterness linger on the tongue. The alcohol is well-hidden and as this beer warms it increases in complexity.";;;;;;;;;;
"The beer pours a cloudy dark amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a good weizen scent that boasts of bananas and clove as well as a nice smokey aroma. It has a wonderful peated malt scent that balances the weizen aroma. The taste is good. It has a mellow wheat and pale malt flavor as well as a mild smokiness that really makes this beer. It goes down easy and finishes dry and earthy. It retains the fruity character of the weizen, but the smoke tames the banana/clove element. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an awesome beer. I really like the German Rauchbiers. The smokey character really stands out; a good drinker.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a pitch black body with very slight deep brown edges when held to the light. A thin, coffee bean colored head rises and falls very quickly into a ring. Good lacing throughout.		Smell is of roasted malts, sweet roasted coffee and barley. Slight wisps of chocolate here and there. Not much alcohol in the nose, but it's there.		Roasted barley and sweet malts are in the forefront, with espresso and bitter chocolate backing it up. Good hop character in the finish, perfectly balancing out all of the sweet elements. It's rich and creamy, full bodied. Alcohol adds a nice kick towards the finish but it's not overpowering - doesn't drink like a 10 percenter.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle courtesy of korguy123, shared with a buddy. Poured into a snifter, cheers dude!		Pours a truly midnight black, with a dark brown head and red highlights. Gorgeous, I know this is gonna crush me. Finger or so of head settles to an extremely thin layer with a collar. Aroma is of vanilla, molasses, roasted maltiness and a whiff of booze. Taste is fairly similar, leading with some roasty and boozy mouth and becomes an intricate mix of chocolate, molasses, a touch of coffee and alcohol that glides slickly over the tongue. Maybe a touch of dark fruits in the finish here, ends slightly dry also. This mouthfeel is unreal, like velvet on the tongue. Drinkability is quite high as well, alcohol is not completely hidden but is intricately woven amongst the other elements of this beer. An excellent beer, truly.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz. bottle		Dark ruby color, with a creamy head that leaves spotted lacing in the glass.		Aroma of bourbon, caramelized malt, brown sugar and vanilla		Flavor is boozy, with bourbon-soaked malt, earthy, slightly tannic and sour oak barrel notes. Alcohol warms the finish and mixes with a touch of vanilla.		Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well balanced & smooth for the strength.		Another excellent bourbon beer from Founders!";;;;;;;;;;
"64oz growler picked up for dirt cheap at the liquor barn in lexington, KY. drank from a standard pint glass. 		A- this one pours out a glowing golden orange colored body with a thick looking bright white head. the head lasts for a while and leaves being solid rings of lacing. 		S- sweet caramel malts come up first. after that comes a boat load of grapefruit like hops. thats about it. 		T- the taste is pretty much like the smell. lots of grapefruit like hops with some sweet caramel malts. nice and bitter.		M- full bodied and palate coating. leaves the mouth feeling nice and dry.		D- either the glass with this one was free, or it was 5.99$ for the fill. fantastic. id buy another one right now if i could.";;;;;;;;;;
WOW!! Be careful with this one. It pours like the finest motor oil available. Super-dark, super-rich with little head. This bomber will leave you bombed by the end if your not careful. Great chocolate, oatmeal, and slight alcohol taste upfront. I detected a nice, clean, coffee, roasted malt and molassas-like finish. While there isn't much of a head, it drinks rather creamy. If you are looking for a Big, I mean Big beer. This one is for you. It was worth the wait, as it took a while for me to locate a bottle. Drink responsibly...this one could hit you like a hammer as the alcohol seems more prevelant as the beer opens. What a great imperial.;;;;;;;;;;
"A - Pours a light brownish / gold. Head is minimal and only comes to about a one finger height. It settles to a barely there ring. Retention is average along with the lacing. Not really much going on with the appearance of this one.		S - Starts out deep and malty. Getting hints of caramel, toffee, and some roasted nuttiness. Alcohol is nowhere to be found. Nose is light overall but still pleasant for the style. 		T - Sweet and smokey. The sweeter flavors follow the aroma pretty closely. A pretty distinct smokiness towards the beginning as well. Let's see...caramel, toffee, tea, and roasted nuts all followed by a touch of bitterness. Alcohol has a light showing at the very end. Not bad.		M - This is where this beer starts to suffer. Lighter bodied and almost too thin for me. Finish stays pretty sweet and only hangs on for a few minutes. 		D - Drinkability is good. The smokiness adds enough to this beer to keep it pretty interesting. Alcohol is covered very well. This is pretty easy to drink but would be more enjoyable with a little more punch in the mouthfeel department. I could have a couple of these over the course of an evening with no problems. Not a beer I would seek out though.";;;;;;;;;;
From a green 330ml bottle, with gold foil around the neck. Pours out a very pleasant looking gold colour, minimal carbonation, and less of a head than I remember from previous ones. The smell is a bold biscuity sweet malt combined with fine floral hops. Like sunshine in a bottle, the sweet malt rolls into the hop finish. Very drinkable stuff, one of my favorites for years now.;;;;;;;;;;
The beer has a bit of a reddish color to it, with a slight haze. There is a small head with a little bit of lacing down the glass. The aroma is mostly that of malts, with a little bit of hops to it. There is a good malty taste, with a bit of a bitter finish. A pretty decent ESB.;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a clear brown color with a creamy, dense beige head. Nice retention and sticky lacing. Very dark for a marzen, but I am guessing that smoking the malt makes it a bit darker.		I can smell it from 3 feet away...smoky, salty bacon goodness. I get some rye bread and some cracked wheat aromas as well.		While not as smoky as the Urbock, it still has a perceived strong smoke flavor due to the lighter, creamier body. Some notes of roasted pecans and mild chocolate are also noticeable. Even with very little hop presence, it still tastes pretty complex. I like it, but not as much as the Urbock.		Smoked BBQ does not do much for rauchbiers, as I first imagined. I have found chili to be really tasty with it though.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle thanks to Zeller1.		Appearance - Poured into a pint glass leaving an inch of white foam. Pours a pale orange honey with a little bit of haze. The foam sticks to the sides as it starts to fade down.		Smell - Piney hops, crisp earthiness, fresh pine needles. It smells extremely fresh and there is a hop citrus explosion on the nose.		Taste - It tastes similar to the smells with hops of a piney and creamy/silky texture getting the first wave with good amounts of hoppy bitterness. After a few sips theres quite a bit of kick in bitterness feeling almost higher than the 70 IBUs it has.		Mouthfeel - Lots of hoppy bitterness to keep the mouth slightly scorched from the burn. Not in a bad way, and the dry piney bitterness has layers of complexity of creamy texture and a very long aftertaste in the mouth. 		Overall - Great beer. As I get close to the finish there is perfect lacing on the side of the glass for inches while a thin layer of white covers the remaining golden elixir. Very easy to drink and refreshing, but probably not one to take lightly.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a hazy orange-brown with a tan head that falls to nothing. Very thinnest of lace. ;;Aroma us of some sweet malts with a noticeable hop background.;;Taste is similar to the smell. Malt taste is sweet and nice. Hops take over giving a bitterness to the finish.;;Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sharpness on the tongue. ;;Not bad. Easy enough to drink.;;
"Pours a radiant clear gold with a fluffy white head. 		Aroma is fresh and hoppy with notes of fresh cut grass, flowers backed by some solid malt tones with a bit of estery fruit and grain.		Taste is clean and assertive yet mild and drinkable. Slight bitterness from generous hopping. 		Mouthfeel is thin with a sharp carbonation and a dry, slightly bitter finish. 		Overall a very nice pils.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a yellow orange color with 2 fingers of white head. Spotty lacing is minimal.		The nose is zesty and citrus forward with some sweet malt to balance it all out. The fresh hops really take over. Lovely.		The taste is fruity and crisp. There is an abundance of citrus hop offerings throughout with a light biscuit malt offering in the back. The citrus hops really shine.		The mouthfeel is light-medium with nice carbonation to keep the flavors striking the palate.		Overall, delicious hoppy brew with great characteristics all around.";;;;;;;;;;
"A nice gift from a London traveler brought back to me last week.	Crack that sucker open. 	Pours a nice soft golden color with moderate head. A bit soapy up top. Brownish hints come to the body the more I look at it. Could be the damn lights.	Smell of earth and floral hops. Semi-sweet hints to it. Apricot and maple come through slightly.	Malt is present, gives it a sweet sense to it, as well as slightly charred caramel. Bready a bit too.	Smooth. Nice pale. Perhaps a bit thin. But it's good drinking.";;;;;;;;;;
"Tried on-tap at the Local Taphouse in Darlinghurst. They seem to have had a good range of MP's brews in recently, which is great.		This one pours a cloudy deep golden colour, almost tending to orange, which I think is quite dark for a saison. Head is fine, but a little bit filmy, leaving some slight white sheeting lacing. Very fine bead. Good depth in the body. Looks good.		Nose is surprisingly spicy, and certainly lacking some of the saison organics and funk. Slight peppery notes and a leafy banana character, that doesn't have enough grunt to be earthy. More of a sweetly spicy and rubbery note. Interesting.		Taste is good. Smooth and sharp, but leavened with a spice character which refreshed and cleanses the palate. Organics come through here, giving a bit of earthy bitterness. Still, not a lot of acidity or funk, but it's pleasant. Finish is smooth with an almost vanilla sweetness.		Again, it doesn't strike me as classically ""Saison"", as it's missing some of the funk, the rawness, the acidity and the rustic genesis. However, it's a tasty and drinkable brew, and a nice one to see on MPBrew's rotation.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a cloudy gold color with very little head. The aroma is peach-tastic. So much peach that you can smell it as soon as the bottle was opened. The taste is crisp and notnearl as sickly sweet as I would have expected based on the aroma. The peach flavor still dominates the flavor, but otherwise this wheat is very, very drinkale. I hate everything else I've ever had from O'fallons except this beer. I gladly bought a whole case of this.;;;;;;;;;;
"Deep ruby in color, more brown really. Light brown creamy two finer of head that dissipates to a film and laces well. 		Smells like an amazing BBQ joint. Rich hickory smoke, malt sweetness and hints of chocolate and caramel. 		Taste is on par with the smell: Big hickory smoke taste, nutty, malty sweetness, with hints of roasted malts and chocolate.		Creamy, slightly coating, medium in body. 		I've been becoming more and more a fan of smoke beers, and this has tipped the scale. Maybe it's just a phase, but I'm in love.";;;;;;;;;;
"Holy Crap! This beer has the best warning label of all time!		...and they are not kidding...this beer pours through a hop cone. Check the top of your beer for a little leaf making its way though into your beer. 		That all being settled, Lupulin Maximus is a IIPA with a hand-packed hop cone in each bottle. Probably around 9% ABV, it pours a golden brown with hops and sweetness on the nose. ...and, it's really good. Slightly citrus in its hop flavor, it kind of reminds me of a sweetened, 9% furious. It's not that sticky, piny hop, west coast, big IPA flavor. This beer might not be good at all in 3 weeks. Go and get it now. Delish.		BTW, I've had one since I wrote this review and it has fallen off quickly. Shoulda had it fresh, I guess.";;;;;;;;;;
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours thick like motor oil, is jet black and has a minimal tan head, with a bit of lacing. The aroma of strong brewed coffee and a hint of chocolate. The flavor profile consist of coffee and chocalate and is pleasantly bitter. This full bodied brew has higher carbonation than I am used to in a RIS, but it is a good thing. This stout is a very good sipper.		After ageing for a year the flavors really mellow out. There is a lot more dark fruit, and more sweetness. I highly recomend aging this one.";;;;;;;;;;
I would be generous in saying that this beer had a light head, since it was really not more than wisps. There was, however, great clarity in a medium-amber beer. It had a nicely hoppy nose, but not overwhelmingly so. I really liked the way that it just seemed to coat my palate with hops, but not in alarming way. This was a very Engligh-style IPA, which I find to be the polar opposite of an American-style IPA, the latter of which seemeing to always want to beat me about the head and shoulders with hops. The finish was very clean: lightly, lingeringly hoppy.;;;;;;;;;;
"Served on-tap at Founders. Shared with FTB and others.		A: The stout is black, a dark morass of a void. Atop said void is a tan-colored head.		S: The nose is bourbon, with vanilla and coffee and chocolate driving the nose.		T: The stout is formidable, a bourbon beast that has a lot to back it up. Vanilla drives the flavor with a boozy afterthought. Coffee and chocolate are strong with cocoa powder evident in the finish. Bourbon ties everything together.		M: A bold stout. This one is a wonder coming out of the barrel.		D: Over 10%? I'll settle for a shared glass. Founders knows their way around stouts.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a hazy amber orange with a thin off white head.Aroma of sweet caramel malts ,honey,and some woody tones.Flavor is awesome,malty caramel,sticky honey,rasins,dates spruce, and burbon. Smooth creamy mouthfeel,a little sticky in a good way. Loads of lacing all the way down the glass,a nice warming effect. Very good;;;;;;;;;;
"Six month old bottle poured pitch black at 62F into a Duvel tulip. Aroma is surprisingly mild.		Very big. Very smooth. Great big smooth roastiness. Noticeable alcohol burn. Main flavor is of oats (toasted oats?), which manifests as a soft graininess. I didn't detect the fruitiness which other reviewers found. There is sweetness here, but it is more than balanced by the strong roastiness and the hops bitterness.		Overall, a little disappointing given the extreme hype on this website around this beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"L: Pours a nice amber brown color with a medium sized an dmedium bodied tan colored head that laced the glass somewhat on the way down.	S: Smells of a fire actually, someone that I had this with said beef jerky, but I would put it as more of a bonfire smell. Very woody.	T: Tastes some like a good smoked meat with a very heavy wood taste that is actually really good. It has some malt in there as well but the smokey flavor over-rides everything.	M: Very warming and spicy with the right amount of carbonation.	D: Pretty drinkable smokey flavored beer. This would go very well with a good meat dinner.";;;;;;;;;;
"Review #300! A HUGE thanks goes out to Scoobydank for giving this bottle to me as a birthday present! Bill, you are the man!		Poured into a red solo cup, size 16 oz. Haha, just kidding ;).		Poured into New Beglium Globe Glass.		Pours a 1/4 finger cocoa brown head. The little head doesn't last long, but the etching brings up some carbonation bubbles. Leaves some lace rings for the little bit of head. Color is a dark dark chocolate brown. The tone of brown is like no other beer I have had.		Aroma: Just amazing. Chocolate. Cocoa. Quality coffee. Hardly, any of the 11.2% abv shows here. A little vanilla. A very robust and complex beer. The blend of chocolate and coffee is just perfect. A nice layer of bourbon and oak go with the other flavors so well. If I could only smell one beer in the world, this would be it (to date that is).		Taste: A little alcohol with the bourbon up front. Strong coffee. Chocolate. (As I am reviewing this, I look at the bottle and realize the side says Malt Beverage brewed with chocolate and coffee. Well at least Founders doesn't lie). Vanilla is definitely doesn't hide here. After I sip on this a bit more, I realize that the alcohol I am tasting is the bourbon. As the beer warms up a bit, the bourbon begins to taste better and better. Very amazing tasting beer.		Mouthfeel: Smooth, rich, and creamy (just like CBS). The bourbon loves to shine through the longer it stays in my mouth. Leaves a very chocolate malty aftertaste. Full bodied. The carbonation level is right on the money for a beer like this (a medium level). Ends a little dry and hot.		Honestly, I don't really know if there is anything wrong with this beer. This big stout is drinking better than a lot of other beers I have had and it is so much darker (not implying that darker means anything). My beer is almost gone already and I want more of it. I am so impressed with Founders for this beer. They managed to make an 11.2% abv beer be so damn drinkable. If I had more I would easily want to crack open another. I will be buying as much of this as I can next year if it makes it to MN. A must try!		Edit: As I just took the last sip, I was so sad that I realized I had no more of this amazing liquid. If you can get any of this, don't pass it up... ever!		Edit2: Changed a few things for the fresh 2010 batch. Nothing too major.";;;;;;;;;;
"Finally, the acclaimed Breakfast Stout makes its way to my glass. Let's do it!		Poured into my Stone imperial pint kinda lazily. Thin head, requisite darkness. 		I give it a few sniffs. Hell yeah. This is what I'm talking about. F'ing chocolate, hazelnut and of course coffee, with a minimum of roastiness. 		Every now and again, it's great to have an imperial stout that isn't roasty to all hell. Indeed, the dark roast coffee flavors are at a minimum...hell, it's like drinking slightly less-sweetened coffee ice cream. Whatever coffee they use for this, it seems like a light, bright roast...dare I say it, a breakfast blend. OK, obviously there is a shitload of coffee in here, but the underlying beer isn't half bad either. Very smooth drinking, kinda creamy yet with a reasonably lively mouthfeel. 		Name be damned, I honestly don't think I want this with my oatmeal at 7AM. It is 8%, after all. That said, for an 8% stout, I don't think you can get much better drinkability, as long as you like coffee. Reminds me of the Terrapin Wake N Bake. I have become a coffee stout fan, actually....yeah, Mr. Farmhouse Ale likes to cross over to the dark side every now and again, for sure.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a golden amber in color. A vigorous pour leads to two inches of bubbly head. Plenty of spotty lacing all over the glass. Smell is mostly all malts, but with a piney hop finish.	Taste is identical to the smell. Very big malt taste up front, then finishes with a piney hop bite. Not overly hopped, but enough in the finish to enjoy. Mostly bitter tasting in the end, moreso than juicy or grassy. Decent beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Aroma of very ripe ruby red grapefruit. 	THis is deep red with hints of brown. Very slick and thick looking. there is little head, but it seems like it would have needed to work pretty hard to form one from this liquid. 	The hop barrage here is bitter from the get go. But, also, super fruity. Muskmelon is a big one. Pear, apricot, rhubarb, tangelo, dried plums, ashes, and assorted spice all contribute to what my tongue sees. The alcohol is a bit hot, but I read the 13% on the bottle so was prepared. 	Mouthfeel is surprisingly alive and more refreshing than anticipated.	this drinks like a hop-bomb barleywine. But really, where is the line between American barleywine and triple IPA? Not my call to make. But if I see this anytime, anywhere, I'm getting it. 	Thanks to MoeSizlak for sharing one of these.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a deep, deep brown, nearly motor oil bodied with chocolate colored medium head.	Smells got some great chocolate and coffee beans here and a great roasted malt.	Flavor is just as it smells. Less coffee and more roasted/chocolate notes.	Finish is a bit muddy, but our after-taste is decent with some coffee bean flavor.	Drinks very well, the body is pretty smooth.";;;;;;;;;;
"One of my all time favourite beers. I have been drinking this beer for many years and when ever I see it on draught, I have some. Morrison's and sometimes Aldi (in the UK) stock it in bottles, but it does not hold a candle to the cask conditioned draught.		This review is from my last tasting, at the 30th Cotswold CAMRA Beer Fest, straight from the barrel which was inside a 15th Century Tithe Barn. The location of this fest is just great, you can't help but enjoy the scene and beers on offer.		Dark Amber, copper coloured, with a fine white head which stays for a long time within the glass, it looks the part.		Fruity, both in aroma and taste, the brewer got everything right in my opinion, and they haven't messed around with the brew since it was first introduced (whenever that was?).		This is a classic British beer, and long my it be so.";;;;;;;;;;
Fresh 8/11 from the cooler. Pours out a nice dark ruby color with a sticky looking head. The smell is rich and malty, slightly smokey, and mildly sweet, with some vanilla almost reminiscent of a fine Bourbon. Really a complex smelling beer. The taste is equally rich and malty, but has a nice citric, resinous hop base to balance it all out. Nice warming alcohol as you sip this one and it works well on a cool night like tonight. More flavors are coming forth, a bit of molasses from all that alcohol, but also some nicely roasted malts. Sure, there is a bit of earthy peat to it, but not nearly as much as some scotch ales I've had and I like it. Anyway, this is a big beer, one to be sipped and slowly warmed and the mouthfeel is pretty smooth too. Overall this is a nice Scotch ale that is making a great alternative right now to the shelves full of tired, but true Oktoberfest offerings.;;;;;;;;;;
"A: poured in to an HB stein, very dark amber. almost no head at all.		S: smoke, leather, and sambuca		T: Bacon, hickory, BBQ.		M: Heavy in the mouth, almost chewy, bubbly carbination.		O: If you love smoked foods, and BBQ what is not to love about this beer.";;;;;;;;;;
Daniel's point on the hops is well taken. But I dissagree with him on the body being too light. Kiltlifter does have a lighter body but not every Scotch ale is a Wee-heavy. I think if you were to put this beer in a 60 shilling (or light) catagory then the body fit just fine. The malt profile is supurb and could not be better. I did take off a point for too much hop for the style but in their defense it is brewed in the middle of hop country so extra hops are hard to resist.;;;;;;;;;;
"Aroma:	Richly malty, slightly buttery and mild banana, smooth and appealing, pleasantly full but un-complex, no discernible hop character.		Appearance:	Deep brown, nearly black - like strong coffee. Need a bright light to punch through it - though it is clear. Nice tan head that dissipates somewhat swiftly and leaves lace in the glass. Overall appealing for a Porter. I'd estimate SRM at 29.		Flavor:	Very nice rich toasted malt, with a character like well toasted sweet brown bread. Barely perceptible roastiness. Pleasant complex sweetness in the background. Finishes slightly dry and mildly bitter like a fine cup of black coffee. Overall, very smooth and lightly complex. 		Mouthfeel:	Slightly slick medium body with very faint astringency. More dry in the finish and on the throat, with a developing sweetness as saliva works on what's left in the edge of the mouth. Appealing for the style.		Overall Impression:	This was a well done, very smooth, medium high gravity Baltic Porter. I enjoyed it very much. Just deepened in smoothness and flavor as it warmed. Certainly worth the price for less than US$3.00 for 500ml that I paid.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance - Pitch black in color, beautiful looking burnt red mocha colored head about half a finger in size. Head retention is good, leaves a ring of bubbles around the glass with islands of bubbles throughout.		Smell - This smells like your quintessential American Imperial Stout: hints of roasted chocolate, coffee, even pull out some fruitiness like strawberries. Nothing about this sticks out as fantastic, but overall it smells quite good.		Taste - Wow, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate! Founder's accidently made alcoholic chocolate milk! Tiny bit of coffee, having trouble pulling anything else out of this.		Mouthfeel - This feels like thick chocolate milk with a little bit of a chalky finish to it. Quite pleasant.		Drinkability - I could drink a couple of these, easy. This thing goes down almost too easy.";;;;;;;;;;
"A colossal thanks goes to my man Shane for this. I have heard such great things about this beer but never thought I'd try it. I owe you one buddy.		A: Pours vigoursly from the bottle to yield a nice tan head in my snifter. Appears brown but nice mahogany hues come through when held to the light. Georgeous look.		S: Wow. Amazong bourbon hits you first and blends magically with the sweet maple undertones. The maple is great, sweet, and near perfection in the scent. Some nice roast and coffee come through as well but the bourbon and maple really shine.		T: This is the best old ale I have ever had. I say that without hesitation. The first flavors you get are good quality bourbon that blend gracefully with sweet maple. I love sweet beers (not the kind that slap you with a bag of sugar), but naturally sweet beers like this. The roast is there to balance the sweetness too, but the maple and bourbon shine again.		Overal, this is a masterpiece of a beer and realy cannot thank you enough Shane!";;;;;;;;;;
"It's October, and the Great Basin Brewery has a fresh hopped offering. It's a hop-head's dream, it's the time of year when freshly harvested hops can be made into the freshest and most delicious IPA, the Fresh Hop Bomb. I couldn't have been happier than to run into this brew.		The appearance was clear and dark tan, the head was unexceptional, but the lacing was substantial, a solid sheet in places. The nose was to die for. Fresh, strong citrus and floral combination, grassy aroma notes, reminds you of walking outside on a fall afternoon.		The taste followed the nose, substantial gritty hoppiness, grapefruit bitter bite with some piney overtones, plenty of floral notes surrounding the citrus core. Full flavor leading to a clean finish, just enough biscuity malt to add the needed balance. 		Mouthfeel was definitely into the puckerish range, medium bodied,little alcohol warmth noticeable. Drinkability was terrific. Very satisfying, pairing well with garlic fries and garlicy salad dressing. Should have stayed and had more.";;;;;;;;;;
It has been a long and somewhat chilly day. I have ben putting some intense hours in at work and I just got two kids to bed and working on spelling with the last one...and I just needed a beer that has some body to it. So I chose the Dark Star Porter from BBC. The color is dark dark amber almost opaque. the head is very thin almost non-exsistent....there is some lacing...but not much. The aroma is powered by roast with hints of coffee and malt. The smell gives way to a very good and creamy tasting porter. The mouthfeel is decent and I could drink the crap out of this tasty libation. Enjoy!;;;;;;;;;;
"A: decent head; clear, syrupy color	S: strong aroma with traces of molasses and a slight hint of roast	T: lightly hopped with stronger components of roasted caramel; bar billing said to have chocolate notes, but I didn't detect it in my serving; not bitter	M: good mouthfeel; not too watery; light bodied	D: well worth going for a second, if the flavor appeals to you";;;;;;;;;;
"22 oz bomber		Pours a deep brown color with quite a bit of red noticeable when held to the light. A thin head forms and quickly retreats to a partial ring around the glass, leaving no lace. Looks delicious.		The nose is my least favorite aspect, though I love it - it probably deserves a 5 - but I find myself unable to avoid disappointment that the smoke aroma I love on the original beer is so well covered by the Jim Beam and oaky vanilla smells. Oh, the smoke is there, but it is light - I'd agree that with the Beam it makes the aroma scotch-like.		I guess I'm glad that if the smoke had to be hidden, it was in the aroma and not in the taste, which is my favorite part. It is a beautiful combination that is at the same time lightly bitter and charred, with some nice pleasantly sweet chocolate and caramel malt, ample bourbon and vanilla, and...well, shit, you'll just have to try the next batch!		Extremely drinkable. I'd like to see it amped up and given a bit more body as it is just a tad too thin to be perfect, but I suspect when the brewery is licensed for such things we'll see such an offering. Until then this will have to do, and is a wonderful effort. 		I loved this beer each time I had it. To avoid ridicule I won't go into detail about the ridiculous lengths I went to to get multiple bottles, but suffice to say it is a sad day that I am down to one bottle, which is promised to someone else.";;;;;;;;;;
"Another one of my brews via Chilidog.. This one I'd had once on a trip to MI, but I was pleased to see it again as I had fond memories. My memory served me well in this case...		Founders Pale Ale pours a golden yellow, with fairly poor head retention. What hangs around is small-bubbled and lacey on the glass sides. There's a lot of trub in the glass, though it's not quite cloudy--just unfiltered in appearance. The aroma is a great balance of sweet, pale malty aromatics and floral, citric Cascades. The taste is exactly the same--sweet, biscuity maltiness, then a long, long citric Cascade finish. The Cascades even make an appearance in the first half of the sip--on the front of the tongue, which is a little unusual for a medium-bodied, non-assertive beer. The carbonation level is great for the style--not prickly or sharp, but perfectly smooth and refreshing. While this beer is really a wonderful celebration of the Cascade hop, it also has a fascinating synergy between the malt and hops. The two come together to create a wonderful, orange pastry flavor that's really addictive! I was thoroughly disappointed that I only had 12 ounces in my glass. This beer gets high marks for drinkability as result.		For a beer style that's become a dime a dozen, this beer does a tremendous job of differentiating itself by being dry hopped, by not being unbalanced toward the hop and by sustaining that wonderful orangey-danish flavor.";;;;;;;;;;
"A-very dark brown with a thing tan head		S-smells like a dark chocolate bar. almost like if you filled the glass with hershey's dark chocolate syrup. has a decent strength		T-oh wow its like taking a shot of pure ground coffee...yes the solid form. it just sticks to your tongue as if it were a powder. it has quite a good matching after-taste. this is a really impressive russian imperial stout. i didn't expect it to be so smooth. there's also a large lack of alcohol note which i find impressive for this one.		M-very thick and full. medium carbonation with a chalky finish		D-well, its not the easiest drinking stout. it definitely took me awhile to finish but it was enjoyable all the way through. this is highly impressive for this style.";;;;;;;;;;
"On-tap at Beachwood BBQ,		A: Pours a golden clear yellow, looks like a pils, very good lace.		S: Herbs and wheat, rather light.		T: Very wheaty, with some sweet fruit and lemons. Nice herbal flavours/wormwood in the finish, big minerality.		M: Frothy, light-bodied, with a considerable mineral presence.		D: My most anticipated beer of the fest turned out to be one of the least impressive. This is good beer, but I wanted the wormwood to come out more, be more interesting, especially when it carries an $18 price tag at Hi-Times.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Hazy straw with a white head, thin ring of retention leaves a little lace.		S: Definitely clove-forward, but not overpowering, white pepper, vanilla and subtle hints of tropical fruit.		T: Clove, wheaty biscuits, a little more bitterness than most (I like that), hints of banana bread and candied pineapple.		M: Moderate body is well-attenuated, not overly carbonated, crisp finish.		D: A good drinker.		This one has bottled & traveled well, but it is lacking a bit of a fresh flavour.";;;;;;;;;;
"Received a bottle in a trade from PDXhops.. a very nice trade indeed. 		- Pours a nice dark black with a small amount of rich mocha head... quickly leaves a thin ring and some scattered spotting. 		- Fantastic balanced coffee and sweet oats, grains, and chocolate roasty goodness.... 		- What a nice smooth balanced stout... hardly tastes as strong as it is... very well balanced with sweetness and dryness... a rather bitter stout... slightly floral and grassy hop, but well balanced with sweet oats, grain, roasty chocolate and coffee.... very well balanced.		- Slightly drying, parching... yet leaves a nice subtle aftertaste....		- Overall an extremely well made stout. Wish this stuff made it out this way... easily competes with any stouts over here on the west coast.";;;;;;;;;;
"750 poured into two snifters		A - Pours black as night with a frothy 1/2 inch thick head		S - is very similar to KBS, very earthy with hints of chocolate, coffe, and bourbon		T - is very chocolatey with lots of maple and bourbon notes. The taste really separates this beer from founders other breakfast stouts. It leaves a sweetness on the palette that's decadent and deliscous		M - is very creamy and smooth on the palette with a little sting of alcohol on the back end which is otherwise hidden by the sweetness. Carbonation is on the low side as expected.		O - A very good beer. Glad we had a chance to try it. I will definitely seek this out again. It alain makes us want to try other maple infused beers as well as experimenting with it in our homebrew.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a deep, cola-brown with a massive, rocky, tan head. It slowly settles to a 1/2 inch layer and leaves a full lacing.	Clean, malty aroma. Notes of dark caramel and sasafrass.	The flavor is smooth & malty with a mild hop bitterness. There is a ""weak coffee"" flavor here too.	Mediumish body with tingling carbonation. Overall a nice, drinkable porter.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured a black color with large rocky brown head that lasted with excellent lacing. Aroma was medium malt and coffe that lasted the whole brew. Flavor was rich and smooth malt and chocolate with a long finish.;;Another very solid brew from this house.;;;;;;;;
"From a six pack of 12 oz. bottles purchased at Menotomy Beer & Wine. Their employees were helpful, friendly and generous.		A- 4 For the style, its hard to screw up the appearance. Deep, dark, completely opaque black color. Brown head, seems to have some head retention issues, but it is quite easy enough to stir up again.		S- 5 Smells of chocolate, dark sweetness/caramel. Very pungent beer. Delicious aroma.		T- 5 WOW. Very flavorful brew. Powerful dark maltiness, but in no way off-putting. Super chocolaty, thick and delicious. 		M- 5 Very thick, but not syrupy. Creamy head mixes nicely. Virtually flawless beer. I am officially impressed.		D- 4 I really couldn't drink this beer forever. But totally worth while to any beer advocate. Very well balanced, and great tasting porter. 		dark ,rich and sexy is right! good beer";;;;;;;;;;
"A light golden beer with a small head and a lot of carbonation.		Smell at first is a typical musty smell that dry yeast can give. A bit of oxidation also doesn't help either. Looking through these off-flavors, which are probably from aging, I smell a fruitiness with some coriander and alcohol. Some of which are higher alcohols.		Taste is fruity with an overall clean, bitter taste. A nice maltiness combined with some hot alcohol, which burns it's way downwards. The fusels make the alcohol a little sharp. The beer is clean bit also has some fruitiness in it that reminds me of a dry yeast strain.	The beer is fermented well and (after)tastes bonedry, nothing sweet or sticky in this beer. Mouthfeel is dry and powdery, which makes the bitterness come out.";;;;;;;;;;
Big thanks to caSSino for bringing this one down to share with me! Reviewed live. Served from bottle into a NoDa Brewing snifter. Pours ruby red with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is comprised of sweet malt, cinnamon, vanilla, candycane, and anise. The flavor is of sweet malt, vanilla, candycane, anise, cinnamon, wood, and subtle spices. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. As far as Winter Warmers go, this is spot-on without a doubt. Really nice holiday spices going on here and a nice touch of candycane to balance it out. A really well done Winter Warmer which is quite hard to pull off in my opinion. Tick.;;;;;;;;;;
"750ml bottle from hopdog via trade. Thanks for the opportunity. Corked and caged.		Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1"" dark brown head above the opaque dark brown/black brew. Foamy head lasts well especially for the style, with thick complementary lacing. Aroma is sweet and roasty, with alcohol noticeable but not dominant. Taste is dominated by the rich maltiness, which is present from start to finish. Whiskey flavors flit in and out, but are certainly not the focus. Warmth comes on after the swallow quite suddenly. Mouthfeel is a bit too bubbly, with quite good drinkability. Liking this one quite a bit, glad I've got a whole bottle to savor.";;;;;;;;;;
Appearance is a rich dark brown with a thin head that dissapates quickly. Aroma has a lot of definate smoke, reminds me of smoked ham. Tastes like it smells, woody and smoky. Mouthfeel is more on the lighter side with good body. A good one to try if you like smoked meats or just to experience a good German smoked beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"A: Bright orange copper color. Pours to a soft two-finger head that lingers and leaves some nice, fine lacing.		S: Strong, dry pine and citrus smells.		T: Outstanding dry hop and malt flavors.		M: Dry somewhat flat in feel. Medium bodied.		D: Very satisfying, dry and warming treat. Perfect for Indian or some other spicy food.		Served in a faceted mug.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours like a golden and better looking Miller Lite. Whispy white head.	Smell is pretty faint, but there is some rind and maybe a limited hop profile.	Taste is very smooth and it is highly drinkable, although the taste is fairly limited in its complexity. Some rind added to the mix is nice though.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from 16.9oz bottle into .5 liter glass stein.		A - light straw color. Not impressive. Looked like miller lite, except for the head, which was snow-white, slightly frothy, sitting atop a good amount of carbonation.		S - Interesting. Smelled like something on fire...like the guy from down the block burning leaves in early fall. Also got notes of thick-sliced white toast with lots of butter, like the kind I have on Sunday morning before watching football.		T - Lightly smoky - less like the guy burning leaves, more like a the campfire your pals built down the path while you were getting in one last cast. Slightly bitter/hoppy start, then the smoke flavor, with a crisp but malty finish. Wow.		M - Slight film in the back of the mouth, reinforcing the smoke flavor. 		D - Well, I'm totally biased - I'm a bit of a helles bier fanboy, I could pound this stuff all day. The smoke flavor could get a little old for the average guy or gal after the third or fourth half-liter of this, but I could (and would, and should) treat this as a late-summer/early fall session beer.		Overall, this is a great introduction to Aecht Shlenkerla - I've had their rauchbier, which is *much* smokier. The smoke flavor is there in the helles, but it's more of a 'come-hither wink & smile' rather the 'two-by-four upside the head' of the rauchbier marzen, which I also enjoy.		This beer would be GREAT with any sort of slow-cooked barbecue beef (texas ribs, beef brisket, sausage) or grilled/smoked bbq chicken. I don't know that I'd pair this with pulled pork or memphis/st. louis ribs, but you never know.		I look forward to drinking this again!";;;;;;;;;;
"Light and amber colored. Fluffy white head dredges its way to a rocky layer on top of this luxurious liquid.		Smells of spinach? Herbal and very earthy with a spicy quality. A side of bready malts. Very different aromas.		Very earthy and herbal again. But I must say it's also very pleasing to the palate and great tasting. Thick resiny mouthfeel, very little flavors of stone fruits, toffee, and what may be a slight diacetyl.";;;;;;;;;;
"I had the pleasure to drink this beer back in the days when there was a LOT of peated barley presence (and it was still called ""Maul Hammer."") It still has some decent mouthfeel, and when it warms up, you get just the slightest reminder of that smoky peat. It has always been a smooth drinker, to the point of being quite dangerous in its 6.5% abv past, but I think it's been dumbed down to the point of near-fogettability. Still, it's better than most US attempts at a Scottish style.";;;;;;;;;;
Appearance: pours a hazy unfiltered golden orange with a frothy white head.;;Smell: dry hopped floral aroma;;Taste: there's a bitter hoppiness up front that generates some nice citrus notes.. a sweet malt presence evens this beer out. Some resinous hop attributes are left on the palate.;;Mouthfeel: medium full and not overly carbonated.;;"Overall: I can honestly say that I haven't had a beer from Founders that I didn't enjoy.. and this one is no exception. A solid IPA that has year round availability; fine with it!";;
"Bottled on 6/2/11 poured into a snifter	Apperance - burnt orange	Smell - Dank hops, great smell	taste - Hop assault, oily, resin, hop bomb	mouthfeel - medium to full,	overall - try this one fresh, I deleted an old review because after having this fresh I realized that it is a different beer when it is fresh. Founders Rocks!";;;;;;;;;;
"A - The most beautiful black I've seen, perhaps because of the hype and anticipation of this beer. I didn't get any head at all from a 2009 bottle, and this was my first and only bottle, so it was hard to lift up on the bottle opener! Only did it because I know I can get some more soon. Mild February, not as much as I want, but still... 		S - sweet dark malt, hint of bourbon and chocolate, as well as vanilla, smell was kind of weak overall compared to the taste. There were hints of all the popping flavors that came and described below.		T - ummm. Nearly perfect, let's get this exact. Each time I went to take a sip from my etched New Belgium globe glass, I had to stop and smell first. On the sip, first you get coldness on the draw with a slight tingle and great carbonation, then perfect amount of sweetness, with subtle bourbon, more subtle chocolate, with perhaps even more subtle vanilla mixed in there. Point is; nothing is over powering. It is probably the most balanced complex beers I've ever had and I am a beer geek and brewer myself. I am sure the creaminess is due to the higher temp mashing process, or some crystal malts, doubtfully maltro-dextrins, but maybe carapils, or even lactose powder, I just don't know, but I am close. NO DOUBT, there is espresso somewhere in there. It's almost as if someone threw a little bourbon in some fudge, but the hops and malts chill it out some. Bourbon can over power a beer, but this is the first bourbon beer that is NOT over powered. I don't really like bourbon, so this is the perfect amount. 		M - stated above, creamy, perfect and slightly tingling to the tounge. Just the best balance of any beer so far. They did a lot of test brews to come up with this one. Fucking awesome! Sorry, but it is true. I love it, ~ drink this before you go out for dinner.		D = yes, all night, no probl3m";;;;;;;;;;
"A : Pours a nice dark brown with a good tan head. Good head retention and lacing		S : Coffee, oak, hints of vanilla		T : Smokey malt, coffee flavors dominate. Hints of bourbon shine through but not as much as I was expecting. 		M : Creamy with good carbonation		D : Pretty good but I just expected a little bit more from the beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Hazy deep gold with 1.5 finger light cream head. Faint retention. Thick, sparse lace.		Lemongrass dominates the nose. Nice citrus lemon bite. 		Surprisingly sweet up front, with a dry middle, and a little lemony sweetness in the finish. No sourness whatsoever. Gets a little tart at the bottom. 		Feel is creamy with a touch of syrup, perhaps a little more syrup than I would like.		For a farmhouse style, this is very easy to drink. The lack of sour in the profile makes it easy to drink more than one.";;;;;;;;;;
"Glad to finally see this when I paid a visit to Wine Country in Long Beach a few weeks ago. I've always struck out in my search for it prior.		Appearance: Pours a fairly opaque jet black. Direct lamplight reveals a little brown on the bottom of my nonic, but not much. Lacing and head is impressive for a beer that has traveled so far to reach my kitchenette - two to three fingers worth of mostly white stuff that settles into a half finger which lingered throughout my consumption. Lacing is finger or cloud like and present, although, perhaps, a little fleeting. Still, very good for a porter, considering that appearance with stouts and porters, in my opinion, is hard to impress by.		Smell: Soy-like molasses, old barrel woods, musty woodsiness in general, slight bourbon or whiskey, cinnamon, cardamom, and surprisingly little chocolate or coffee, but more coffee than chocolate. Still, the wood-like character and the spices are warming to the nose, and far exceed my expectations.		Taste: Bourbon or whiskey more prominent in the mouth than the nose. A little alcohol. Corkiness. Turkish coffee-like bitterness on the back end, but extremely subtle and integrated into the other flavors superbly. Overall, extremely balanced, very complex, and very bold simultaneously. 		Mouthfeel: Much better than what I've run into with other American-brewed porters, which tend to be too thin for me. This was medium to full bodied, with a nice fizz.		Drinkability: Excellent. This beer manages to maintain a sense of balance despite its heavy ABV and bold flavorings, making it very drinkable for a beer its ""size.""";;;;;;;;;;
"pours an unfiltered golden orange with a finger of bubbly head.		smell is fresh piny hops, some sweet and a bit of fruit.		taste is very bitter. it starts off with a hint of sweetness and finishes with strong bitter and hops. grapefruit and other citrus are present.		mouth is medium-thick with medium carbonation.		this was a pretty good beer. definitely enjoyed the unfiltered hoppyness aspect. will enjoy this again for sure.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Slightly cloudy gold with a bit of amber in the center. The is big and fluffy and leaves tenacious rings of lace down the side of the glass.		S: Dank weeds, like dandelion & cannibus and some sweetness lurking in the background.		T: Sweet lemon, tea, a hint of brine, bitter and dry finish.		M: Medium heft, a little coating, then medium dry.		D: This is yummy, the fresher the better, makes me wish I had a kegerator so I could drink a few of these every night.";;;;;;;;;;
This beer pures an amber/orangish hue with a very small head that goes down pretty quickly.;;The smell has a great pumpkin pie aroma that is heavy on cinnamon.;;The flavor is of cinnamon wiht some caramely/bready malt. ;;The mouthfeel has a good body and is actaully a little heavy so it goes along with the flavor. The carbonation helps balance out the heavy body.;;This is a pretty drinable beer and is not to sweet or cloying as some of these beers can be.;;
"This is a cask ale that I had a pint of at BRBP.		A: Hazy amber color. Maintained a bit of head with good lacing.		S: Smells red to me if that makes sense. Fairly hoppy.		T: Creamy malty hoppy goodness. Not too bitter, or at least not as bitter as it smells. Really creamy.		M: The creamy feeling is amazing! 		D: I could drink several of these. There isn't too much bite and it has a great balance.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle (2011)		Thanks for sharing, Kgristoff!	Thanks for sharing, NoSignsOfPain!		Black on black with a thick, persistent brown head. This beer looks thick and heavy.		Powerful aroma of coffee, roasted malts, and some mild chocolate. I was actually expecting far more chocolate as the bottle describes this is as a ""double chocolate...stout,"" but that's not to say I'm disappointed in the slightest with this aroma. It's wonderful. 		The coffee flavors and delicious roasted malts present again and the chocolate is far more accessible in the flavor than the aroma. This stout is creamy, rich, slightly bitter, full of coffee, and rich melting chocolate. Divine.		Medium to thick bodied. Hearty.		An incredible coffee (chocolate) stout. Not to mention, it went great with breakfast!";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance - Pours a dark copper color with a small head that vanishes quickly.		Smell - Almost smells like wine.. Some type of fruitiness, maybe grape and citrus. Some caramel hints too.		Taste - Very sweet.. kinda citrusy. Malty with notes of caramel. Not very bitter at all for being a pale ale.		Mouthfeel - Pretty thick with very little carnonation.		Overall - This is very good for being a pale ale.";;;;;;;;;;
"This is a very good, flavourful yet restrained and fairly balanced stout.		Black with a dark tan thin head soon shrinking to a foamy ring, it has some good lace.		Aroma is roasty with light chocolate, plus some hints of wood and prune.		Taste is roasty-earthy and woody with some spicey bitterness and with sweetness and bitterness present but pretty well balanced.";;;;;;;;;;
This is one of the better pilsners I've had lately but by no means my favorite. Pours a grassy yellow color with an off-white head. Smells grassy, alot of hoppiness and a grass finish. This beer is very bubbly. Despite the bitterness it was very drinkable, though it is low thrills.;;;;;;;;;;
A: Heavy gold with hint of ruby, thin layer of spider web-like head, a few patches of foam clinging to the sides of the glass - 4.25, S: Lots of citrus, tropical fruit and some bubblegum, based on a recent tasting involving Amarillo I'm guessing they are part of the build - 4.50, T: Sharp hop bite, on the side of earthy, malt is present but can't stand up to the huge hop flavor, pine sap, alcohol is noticeable but not prohibitive - 4.25, M: Slightly chewy, medium to heavy body - 4.50, D: This is a mammoth of a beer and perfect for sipping - 4.00;;;;;;;;;;
"Into the Sam Smith Pint...	Bottle said it is 6.5% alcohol, not 5.1% as noted above.		A - Deep brown with mocha head. Good lacing and a solid three fingers of head from an assertive pour.		S - Nice and roasty with semi-sweet chocolate notes in the finish. Light hops with no esters. Smells like a good, sessionable winner.		T - Sweet and chocolaty at the entry, with a faint esters in the background. Starts to dry out towards the swallow, the sweeter chocolate becoming more of a bakers chocolate. Finishes nice and dry, with lots of coffee, baker's chocolate & pine. No off flavors that I could detect.		M - Full and creamy, with carbonation that seems spot on for its style.		D - This is a fine American Porter. Not too dry, not too sweet, pretty straight forward, with no off flavors. Might not be the most complex, but a solid session beer. Good deal and an enjoyable sixer.";;;;;;;;;;
"On-tap at Beachwood BBQ,		A: Pours golden with a firm white head, good lacing and retention.		S: Noble hopping, grassy, with some sourdough type malt.		T: Malt is fairly prominent in this pilsner, very bready and grainy. The hops lend a nice balance, very traditional. A good flavour, but I'm not going wild.		M: Crisp, smooth, medium-bodied, creamy.		D: Solid pils, nice to see it on-tap, because you never know how long those bottles on the shelves have been sitting around for.";;;;;;;;;;
pored a slightly cloudy golden amber color with white puffy head that quickly dropped to a thin lacing. Smell is of things scicy, cloves, nutmeg. taste is very good and leaves a nice dryness in the moth that makes me want more. An excellent choise for a hot sunny afternoon sitting on the deck watching my sons mow the grass;;;;;;;;;;
Another interesting offering from CBC.  This brew has a deep copper or ambery-brown colour with a light-tan head and a creamy lace that generates a few rings.  My nasal sense was blunted, but a friend told of a hoppy, floral sweetness.  A nice big, toasty malt and nuttiness fill the palate and are followed by a mixed bag of hops.  This brew is balanced, but the toasty, nutty malt is boss.  A deep, medium body with a vibrant hold on the tongue.  A big and toasty brew with a touch of the ol' alcohol in it.  I imagine this beer best with a complinment of food to cut the malt and alcohol, but a treat anytime.  Cheers.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from newer logo'd ""KBS"" 12 oz bottle into a New Belgium Snifter. Unfortunately, I did not have this for breakfast because that would've been perfect.		A - Dark dark stout that shows a tan head (like a RIS). The top showed pockets of head like a belgian yeast typically produces. Great lacing on this guy. 		S - Simple, wood and alcohol. Roasted malts and coffee could be picked up beyond.		T - Gets dinged a little because of the sharp alcohol burn, but a fantastic brew otherwise. Lots of chocolate and roasted malts. Heavy oak flavoring to match the bourbon taste. 		M - Heavy, creamy, good carbonation. I do like Imperial Stouts with heavy carbonation to let the flavors dance around like a Dark Lord. This is no Dark Lord however.		D - I really wish this was more than 12 oz. I'd like to taste on a 750 ml all night.";;;;;;;;;;
"Decided to check in on this one and finally write a review. 12oz bottle poured into my Maudite snifter.		I recall there being a significant amount of floaties in this one the first time around and a resulting overpowering yeast presence. I decided to carefully handle and pour this one to avoid that. A soft pour yields a beautiful clear ruby-amber color with almost no head but some carbonation bubbles are rising from the bottom.		Aroma is big and deep with vanilla, some maple, crisp malt sweetness and a solid alcohol presence. I'm also getting some cooked banana in the background.		Taste opens up with a sharp wheat presence followed up by some caramel sweetness and a mild bitterness. Finish features some maple and some alcohol, but it's really calmed down quite a bit. Thankfully, my efforts to keep the yeast out have made this a much more enjoyable experience.		Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with minimal carbonation. It has a nice feel for a strong sipping beer. Overall this one doesn't disappoint, though it is definitely a sipper. It's aged quite nicely as I didn't care for it much the first time around, but I think that had more to do with the copious amounts of yeast than anything.";;;;;;;;;;
Medium-golden with a compact, foamy, white head. Light, grainy bread malt aromas are overshadowed by lively, spritzy, fresh, citrusy hops. Light malt flavors up front. Grainy, faintly sweet. Big zesty hop splash. Fresh, citrusy, juicy, and bitter. Very thirst quenching beer here. Light bodied, dry at first and then juicy hop finish. A nice session ale that's all about fresh, juicy hops!;;;;;;;;;;
A- Absolutely pitch black with a thick and creamy brown head. Syrupy thick and gorgeous.;;S- Not very aromatic at all until it gets closer to room temperature. Loads of vanilla and some chocolate.;;T- Absolutely wonderful. Super smooth with a massive amount of vanilla and smooth dark chocolate. Very roasty with a hint of alcohol in the tail end and some sweet maple syrup hints.;;M- Smooth and creamy with a nice carbonation bite.;;D- Sweet and smooth with great vanilla flavor. A big sipper. This would make an excellent desert beer.;;
"I was torn on this one. Drink it from the can, as it was meant to be drank, or pour into a glass. Well, I went with a glass. Old habits die hard....		Pours a golden copper color with half an inch of off-white head. Nice lacing clings to the glass.		The aroma, even after it warms, doesn't give me anything but grapefruit and tangerine hops. The scent, while very nice for an IPA, just seems muted. I guess I just want it more in my face and not so much like a sachet of hops thrown in a drawer. Make sense?		The flavor is more in my face...and I like it! I wish I could give this one a 4.25 cuz that is where I feel it belongs. Nice and bitter hops come out in a wide range of citrus flavors. It's pretty damn bitter, but that is why I like it. A bit earthy at the end. Also had a taste of powdered aspirin right at the finish. The finish keeps it from getting to that 4.5 for me.		Medium bodied. Average carbonation. Bitter, drying aftertaste screams for you to take another sip and I'll gladly oblige. Another canned beer worthy of any tailgating, camping, golfing, outdoor event of your choosing where bottles are frowned upon. I think I found another can to sit along side Dale's and Gordon in the beer fridge.";;;;;;;;;;
"How to appreciate a exellent american IPA? I found out tonight that having a small quantity of exellent wine made my palate more sensible to this ale. I'll try it again on other beers to see if this happens again.		Pours a proper hazy orangish dark tan yellow. Big foamy head and quite effervecent (might just be the contrast from the still wine that makes me notice the carbonation more).		Awesome aroma of Centennial Hops and caramelised malts. Citrusy, apple-pear-apricot fuity, candy-like, awesome.		Flavor is much like the aroma, soft malt sweetness just complements nicely the onslaught of hop flavor and bitterness, It's quite good!		Its a great beer, drink lots of it.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured into my new DFH signature glass. It has a slightly hazy deep golden color with a little over a finger worth of head that is leaving some great lacing as it recedes. The smell is incredible. There are some great orange and grapefruit citrus notes coupled with the hint of pine. The taste has a nice bitter presence upfront. The citrus taste is much more subdued than I was expecting. The pine come to the fore front on this beer and in a great way. The bitterness doesn't linger too long which leaves a nice finish. Overall this is definitely one of the best DIPAs I have had. I am curious to see how I have ranked it compared to others I have had, but it should be up there if not at the top. It is another beer by Founders that has impressed the hell out of me. Thank God they have arrived in Georgia.;;;;;;;;;;
Although this particular representation of the Vienna style is more reminiscent (IMHO) of a Pilsner than Marzen, this is truly a wonderful brew. While it was cold and rainy when I entered CBC for a BA meeting, and I saw all the full pints of Porters, Scotch Ales and Stouts at the table, I wanted to start light and work my way up. This deep golden brew possesses more body than meets the eye. Topped by a rapidly dissipating white head with thin clinging lace. The aroma of Saaz hops, herbal malt and hint of alcohol rising up, lasts a while. The sharp edged bitterness softens and blends with the lightly sweet malt into a highly quaffable beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"Vintage 2010. Served at cellar temp ~55. Poured into a plain snifter. Color is pitch black....maybe some hints of brown in the right light. With a fairly vigorous pour, KBS only develops about a 1/4"", brown colored head, that receded pretty rapidly to a sudsy ring, leaving a modest amount of lace on the glass.		The aroma starts out with some pretty nice coffee and dark chocolate aromas, giving in quickly to a well-balanced bourbon character. Roasty and burnt caramels, with some sweet molasses notes.		The flavor follows suit. The coffee/dark chocolate characters take front seat, followed up quite nicely by a sweet booziness from the bourbon as well as a nice woody/oak character that I don't necessarily pick up in the aroma. The finish is well balanced, starting out with a sweet cream/marshmallow flavor, but falls short of becoming cloying, leaving just a mildly bitter, roast coffee flavor on the palate.		Mouthfeel is thick & sticky-icky. As I swirl it in my snifter, it coats the surface of the glass with an oil-like slick. Carbonation is very mild, just enough to tickle the tongue, but doesn't distract from the creamy mouthfeel of the beer. Compared to some of Founder's other bourbon barreled aged beers, I found this one to be the most balanced with the bourbon flavors. The bourbon is there but it melds perfectly with the characteristics of an amazingly well-crafted coffee stout. KBS is full of complex flavors yet remains well balanced. While I wouldn't recommend drinking more than one or two, all I know is I can't wait to crack my next KBS in a few months!";;;;;;;;;;
"Was glad when this one found the shelves at the LCBO here in TB. A definate bargain as well at 2.45/500ml.		Appearance	Pours black, seems clear as evident by the garnet hues around the edges where the light can come through. A one finger tan coloured head formed on the pour of this mildly carbonated brew. Little to no lacings present.		Aroma	Rich and sweet smells of medium roasted malts. Fruity scents of cherry and prune, some alcohol, hints of more bitter roasted malts and earthy spice.		Taste	Interesting. Roasted malt bitterness is quite subdued, hints of espresso and dark chocolate make a slight appearance in the finish. However rich and fruity flavours of black cherry and prune form the backbone of this porter, and are supported by nutty and caramel malt flavours. Decent hop finish, with a mild yet peppery earthy spice.		Mouthfeel	A slick and silky full bodied brew. Perfect for a winter's night. Low level of carbonation in this rich and decadent treat. The rich and sweet malts are never cloying, and are decadently balanced by a touch of bitter malts and the earthy and spicey hops.		Drinkability	A very tasty and drinkable big beer. Rich and full bodied, but would make a tasty, slow paced decadent session. Approachable yet complex, ill be enjoying this one again!";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz undated bottle into a pint glass.		color is a deep amber to copper, much richer than i expect from an ipa. a hard pour forms one finger of off white head that dissipates quick. the ring left in the glass produces some thin, leggy lacing though.		really nice floral hops and citrus fruit in the nose. taste follows with a substantial malt backbone and a pleasant bite from the hops. i'm picking up notes of grapefruit, toffee and pine resin. like any good ipa the bitterness lingers, but isn't overpowering here. pretty well balanced and a little more complex than most.		mouthfeel is a little thick for an ipa, but still smooth with the right amount of co2. has a bit of a chewy quality.		drinkability is good and goes down easy. maybe not a session beer, but certainly delicious and to style. to me this comes across as being just a little bit better in each category than most of the ipa's i have had.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle from the clearance table: best by...2/5/08!?!? Let's see what a 4year old Helles tastes like.		A: Cloudy pale orange body with a solid one-finger cap of dense off-white head. Nice retention and lace. Solid, but greater clarity would have been nice.		S: Wow - I was not expecting such rich, oxidized maltiness (well, oxidation yes, richness no. There's bread, caramel, sherry, and raisins. Strange and enjoyable.		T: Sweet malt opens things up, followed by sherry, a touch of cardboard, and some borderline-rancid fruit. The age is a bit less delightful here, but it's by no means undrinkable. I kind of like it, actually.		M: Lively medium body. Very nice.		O: I expected this to be laughably bad, but it really wasn't. Obviously a well-made beer. If it weren't so expensive normally, I wouldn't have waited for it to be on clearance.		Cheers!";;;;;;;;;;
"A beer and brewery that changed my life and my view of beer. This beer shows that you don't have to do anything crazy, you just need to do something really well inorder to succeed.		A - Pours like motor oil, a deep black color. The deep brown head was small and faded quickly.		S - Burnt roasted nutty aroma with heavy coffee and hints of chocolate.		T - Smokey and burnt flavors. Finished with the bitterness of coffee. The heartiness of the oatmeal is evident in taste and body. The is a slight metalic flavor as well.		M - Full bodied with a smooth dry finish.		D - Probably more drinkable than it should be. Smooth and creamy they go down smooth. And absolutely fantastic brew. Congrats Founders.";;;;;;;;;;
This brewery made a big splash at the Extreme Beer Fest, so I thought I would try some of there beers. I stopped by Downtown Wine and Spirits in Somerville, and there was a nice selection of their products on the shelves. Nice deep copper color with a thick, foamy white head. The head settled to a complex lace soon after I poured the beer. The nose is mostly citrus and floral hops. A little pine and some toffee from the malt. Nice bright taste with pine/grass and the citrus of the hops balanced nicely by caramel malt. This has a wonderful bright mouth feel and is very drinkable;;;;;;;;;;
"This beer is super boozy.	It's quite viscous and thick and pours well, but this beer needs a lot of age before it becomes worthy of being a premium barrel aged stout. It tasted almost like I poured a swig whiskey into the regular BORIS, which is a great drink. I have a feeling in 2013, this drink is going to be awesome, wonder if I have the patience on my other bottle.";;;;;;;;;;
Strong roasted malts and coffee on the nose. A hint of wood but not too different from breakfast stout. Taste is a mellow blend of roasted malts, coffee, and oatmeal with definite woody undertones. onts of maple underlie the whole thing! Very tasty but not all that different from KBS;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Pint Glass. The notch on the label isn't really clear, however I would say that a slight notch is around June. Bought this at the local bottle shop for $3.50.  	 	A- One finger head quickly goes down to a thin layer. Orange in color, has very little going on inside. 	 	S-Smell light hints of citrusy hops. Smell not as strong as I thought it would be. Something sweet also going on, but not sure what. 	 	T- So far, I have been disappointed, but this is the part that counts. And man, does this change everything. Nice, refreshing hops bounce around my happy mouth. Floral, tingling, and just down right delicious. These hops are just a little different than what I'm use to and I really enjoy this. 	 	M- Medium Carbonation and lots of body. Tingling of throat form the hops is very nice. Slick and nice. 	 	D- I really enjoyed this after drinking some strong Maibocks, nice change of pace. I guess I consider myself a hophead, and this one certainly doesn't disappoint. I thought we were going down hill on this until I tasted and did a 360. Nice brew. 	 	Cheers, 	Scott";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Amber-red, slightly hazy body with a thick off-white head of a good few fingers, which leaves a respectable cap.		S: Great fresh, herbal and grassy hops with the rye, along with some chocolatey malts, and light yeast as it opens up.		T: Much like the smell, but the hops show more variety, with some nice citrusy tones. The yeast isn't as aggressive.		M/D: Full body, with an excellently long finish. It's brilliantly spicy and sweet, with the hop bitterness rounding it out extremely well. I wish New York had Founders.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pitcher at Winking Lizard in Mentor Ohio. I had 1 and my friend had 1. Two beautiful black Pitchers of Goodness . Nose is milky cocoa, smokey, nice malted milk character, some dark fruits & really dark caramel. Flavor is sweet roasty malt, rich dark fruits. A touch of burnt in the slightly smokey & malty finish, along with a bit of hop that balances things perfectly. 1 of my favorite Porters ""Ever"" along with a Founders Breakfast Stout...mmm Good.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Pale amber in color, beutifully clear, with a nice white head. 		S: Sweet caramel, a slight tropical fruit flavor with a hint of pine wood. 		T: Sweet fruit flavor at first, followed by a nice tropical hops flavor. A bit of a malt in the back, but the hop flavor dominate. Not too bitter, just pleasantly hoppy.		M: Medium bodied, slightly chewy, perhaps a little over carb'd		D: Very good overall, but I would like to see a little more balance from the malty side. I think the hop profile is dead on.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter.		A: Pours really dark, like maple syrup dark. 1/2 finger of creamy dark tan foam spreads out on top and sticks around for a while. Plentiful lacing left behind.		S: Nice aroma of hops, brown sugar, roasty malt, and raisins. A little grapefruit in there as well.		T: Very complex with interesting dark fruit, dark roasted coffee and a touch of grapefruit/hops at the end.		M: Starts malty and sweet with some obvious hopness to it. I don't sense much alcohol in this one even at 12%. Dark roasty malts kind of linger on the tongue though.		D: Overall I felt this was a step up from the 09'. I realize they're two different animals but this felt like a more thorough effort from Founders. I can't wait to try the 2011!";;;;;;;;;;
"Served in a tulip glass. This is the standard Colonel porter, not the cask one with treacle.		This beer poured a black body with a small off-white head.		The nose was a nice mix of dark malts and a strong oak/wood touch.		Taste was very nice. Medium bodied, rich and smooth. Dark roasted malts, coffee, even chocolate, yet not quite as in your face as a big stout. Still very porter like. The overpowering flavor of this baby though is the oak aging. Bourbon, touches of vanilla and wood. Not much in the way of smoke, although the roasted flavors gave mild hints. Milder bitterness that flows under the radar but sits just well enough in the mix to add balance.		Overall a really nice beer. Oak, oak, oak. Reminded me of like a session version of some of the big oaky imp stouts like great divides yeti or the magic hat one (whose name escapes me. Good beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottled 10/14/09.		Served cool in a chalice.		Breakfast stout has a very dark brown color with good clarity evident during the pour. The creamy fine head is short lived but some lace is left behind.		Aroma has a lot of roast to it - roasted malts, dark roasted coffee, even roasted nuts. There's some bitter chocolate in the nose as well but it's in the background. Hops are evident, moreso than in most versions of this style, but they still take a back seat to the dark malts and coffee.		Flavor is simply excellent. For someone who loves coffee, beer, and especially coffee stouts, this ranks up there with the best, which for me means espresso oak aged yeti. The coffee flavor is certainly not hidden in the beer. It comes on strong right from the start and lingers through the finish. There is a lot of great bitterness. It seems to be mostly from the malts but it's fairly hoppy too, for a stout. The chocolate is not as dominant considering it claims to be a double chocolate stout. 		Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, full bodied, low carbonation. The flaked oats are certainly a factor here and really make the beer just that much better.		I knew this was going to be good but it's truly excellent. One of the best ever.";;;;;;;;;;
Ruby brown color. Nice lacing from the thin film that remains after the smallish head dissapears. Very full caramel flavor and taste. Slight burnt flavor in the finishing taste which gives it a slight bitterness at first that builds as you drink more of the beer. Very chewy and full mouthfeel. My first Founders beer and it did not dissapoint. Read the description for a scotch ale/wee heavy and this is it to a tee. Love the description on the bottle too. Overall a very enjoyable beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into my hefe glass. Appearance is light, clear golden with a 3-finger, frothy white head. Minimal lacing.		The smell is strong of cloves, yeast, banana & lemon. Taste is mainly cloves, lemon, wheat & herbal hops. Mouthfeel is light & crisp; more carbonated than a lot of other hefes I've had, but that's not a bad thing.		This is a drinkable hefeweizen, flavorful & not medicinally bitter like a lot of American hefes out there.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured a light brown color with a two-finger head that died quickly and left some lace. Mostly a meaty smell with that hint of pils-like malt and grassiness I always get from Aecht biers. This one isn't as smoky/meaty as the others; they've turned down the smoke/charrness to let the hops peek through as this beer is light, smooth, and there's a touch of sticky sweetness all in there - but yes, mainly a smoky beer with a dry finish. Prickly due to carbonation, this beer is crisp and bitter and a real sipper; I find that I like this but not as much as other beers from this brewery.";;;;;;;;;;
"The whole canned microbrew thing is really taking off. With Surly, Caldera, and others now proving that canned beer can be as good or better than bottles, I tihnk in another 5 years the market will explode. 		Brick/rusty orange flows into my pint glass from the brightly designed can. Smaller head, though the lacing sticks to the side of my glass with tenacity. 		Aroma is a bit weak compared to other PacNW IPA's. However, after the brew warmed up a bit, there was a noticable improvement in the strength. Noticed hops of course. More sweet florals that other IPAs. Grapefruit, lemon, cannabis. 		Flavor was superb. For the first second, I notice a sweet smoothness. Then the hops set in and I am awash in bitter pine and citrus. Again, cannabis notes as well. The finish has caramel and bitter earthen/soil characteristics. 		I really like this one, and get no metallic or other ""can""-like flavors. (not that I expected to). I've got a 6-pack, and I would like to drink at leas tone straight from the can, it seems like the thing to do.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a cloudy, amber color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. There is also suspended sediment. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of yeast, strong alcohol, slight oak, and slight citrus hops. Fits the style of an Old Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong alcohol, oak, slight citrus hops, slight yeast, and hint of sweet malt. Overall, overly strong in the alcohol, not very complex, but definitely warming.;;;;;;;;;;
"Really enjoyed this beer, broke out at a tasting over the weekend. . Lovely brown with decent head. Aroma redolent of coconut and smoke. On the palate, less smoke than you would have thought based on the aroma - no, the smoke is more integrated with the bourbon from the barrels, and some raisiny sweetness. Lively mouthfeel. 		Seriously, I could probably have taken down the whole 750 myself....but it turned out to be a great share.";;;;;;;;;;
"This was the clear winner of our five beers tasted. Of the 10 tasters, it received three overall ratings of 5 and six overall ratings of 4. The one woman who did not enjoy the beer (rating of 2) admitted that the coffee tones were very nice in both the taste and the nose. The consensus was, even among those of us not usually into stouts, that the dryness of the oatmeal/imperial styles kept it from being too thick or overpowering. It was balanced well enough that many were surprised it had such a high abv.		Overall average: 4.1";;;;;;;;;;
Clear coppery amber in color with a large foamy puffed high dark ivory head, fades slowly down to thick haze always present and long stings of lace stick well throughout the consumption. Light toasty malt aroma with some grassy/floral-like hops and notes of toffee. Taste is nice and soft, well rounded toastyness of malts, light dry grassy hops dry out some of the finish with some mild bitterness lingering. Feel is close to medium with playfully light carbonation, fluffy textured and floats right down making for some easy drinking. A good session brew, filling in a calming easy fashion with just enough flavor and body to keep it interesting. Thanks to Brent for the sample pack of KY beers from the holiday exchange program here at BeerAdvocate! Happy Holidays all!;;;;;;;;;;
"This is a light but tasty beer with fairly firm character and balance.		Faintly hazy pale amber-gold, it has a white head that steadily shrinks to a thin ring and wisps.		The aroma is grain and citrus with a little yeast.		The taste has grain, citrus, but good balance. It is light but the character holds up well, it is balanced, and overall the elements are well-integrated.";;;;;;;;;;
"Brandy Barrel Double Trouble on tap at the Founders tasting room.		Appearance- Light gold with a small but lasting head. Good lacing.		Aroma- Sweet honey right up front. After a couple sniffs the hops come out with a light citrus note.		Taste- Oak, vanilla, honey, with a rather crisp light bitterness at the end. This is really sweet at first but it unfolds into a much more complex bunch of flavors after a minute.		Mouth/Drink- Perhaps a touch thick with not as much carbonation as I would like but overall pretty nice and smooth.		I think the brandy really makes this a completely different beer. If the bartender hadn't said it was Double Trouble aged in Brandy I would never have guessed.";;;;;;;;;;
GOLDEN AMBER WITH A HEALTHY HEAD AFTER A VIGOROUS POUR.;PINEY GRAPEFRUITY FRAGRANCE;A FANTASTIC TASTE YOU COME TO EXPECT FROM AN ABOVE AVERAGE IPA THAT BITTER SENSATION IN THE BACK OF THE THROAT AND SIDES OF THE TONGUE;RICH TASTE WITH AMPLE CARBONATION;OVERALL JUST A DELIGHTFUL OFFERING FROM FOUNDERS;;;;;;
"Had on draft at CBC on May 10, 2010.		Cloudy golden pour. Thin white head, no lacing.		Subtle smells, nothing comes through too much, just a faint hoppiness.		Very crisp taste up front, hoppy but not overwhelming. Good mix of citrus and earthiness. Lots of carbonation.		Refreshing beer, good for the summertime.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Pours a hazy, marmalade orange/honey color, with a solid, frothy 2-finger head; leaves marvelous, sticky lacing and looks like a witbier with a punch		S: aromas are similar to a witbier as well, but even stronger; orange peel, citrus, honey, floral notes, spices, and a dry, hoppy note		T: the aroma flavors are strong up front; as the beer warms, a sweet caramel maltiness becomes noticeable; also, the spicy notes become enhanced, as the alcohol comes through		M: bold and velvety, with a sticky sweet warmth on the back of the throat at the finish		O: a great beer; in typically wonderful Belgian fashion, a complex and deliciously sweet/bitter combo";;;;;;;;;;
Poured into a small sampling glass this brew is thick like chocolate milk with a dark chocolate color and a nice firm tan head settling into a solid cap. This brew has strong hints of chocolate, burnt caramel, and light vanilla. The taste is thick and oily with nice burnt malts and a slight chocolate finish. The taste lasts long after the last drop and ends dry. This gets more complex as it warms and was delicious. Must have on a Saturday for breakfast when not working.;;;;;;;;;;
22 oz bomber from Roth's Vista Market, Salem. Appearance? average amber colour..but ominously a HUGE oversized thick off white head. Aroma not too bad, honeyish, buscuity malts, slight lemony hop. Taste is pretty malt driven again honeyish, with a bready tone also. Hops are taking up the end and are slightly citric in character. Kinda average palate to this one. Not too bad though. Over all an average pale.;;;;;;;;;;
"Had this on 2011-12-24 in Lititz, PA. Tip of the hat to Matt Capone of Capone's in Norristown, PA for the lottery allowing me to acquire this 2011 release.		A - Opaque dark brown with a 1/2-finger light tan head and mild lace.		S - Bourbon, maple, vanilla, oak and coffee.		T - Dark fruit, sweet maple, coffee, plenty of chocolate, mostly roasted bitterness, oak, vanilla, bourbon, alcohol. Softer and a little sweeter than KBS. 		M - Thick body, light carbonation, syrupy with a soft mouthfeel.		O - Really excellent. Complex but soft and easy to sip. Better to my palate than the KBS or FBS. This is my highest rated Imperial Stout (so far).";;;;;;;;;;
"Presentation: Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle as pictured with no freshness or bottled on dates.		A: Clear light amber in color. Almost a cross between a slightly tarnished penny with yellowish tints. A thin white head with minimal lacing.		S: Mainly bready, malty aromas. Wet grains and some mild hops. 		T&M: Biscuity and grainy malts are prominent. Some mild bitterness in the middle to end. Nice caramel malts up front that is balanced well with the hops. Light to medium bodied, clean and crisp but a slight bit watery on the palate. 		Decent brew. I'm not a huge fan of Oktoberfest beers as of late. But this is nice and drinkable.";;;;;;;;;;
"As always, big thanks to prototypic for sharing the wealth.		A - Pours mostly brown with a little bit of a pink hue. Head is somewhat minimal and also has a hint of pink to it. Retention looks to be just about average. Some spotty lace stays behind in the glass. Not a bad looking beer but nothing to write home about either.		S - Aroma is absolutely dominated by raspberries. It starts with raspberry with some raspberry that comes in about midway. Towards the end, more raspberry. On a side note, there might be a hint of cherry hidden in here. Pretty one dimensional overall. Not bad though.		T - Well, well, well...Flavor starts with raspberry. It's not quite as one sided as the aroma. There seems to be layers to the fruit that adds at least a little complexity. It starts out with a sweeter sugary flavor and quickly changes to a mouth puckering tartness. Alcohol stays very well hidden til the very end. It's good but still comes across as a little too one dimensional for me. 		M - Body is lighter than expected but that isn't a problem with this beer. Carbonation is lively and also works well. Finish is tart and has a little heat to it.		D - Drinkability is good for a 12.3% raspberry bomb. It's simple but I think that's what Founders is going for with the Blushing Monk. It goes down quite easy given the abv. Actually, the alcohol is hard to pinpoint which is pretty shocking for a beer of this stature. A good idea might be to share this brew. A bomber might be a bit much in a session for one person but I'd sure be happy trying to put one away myself. Another fine brew from Founders.";;;;;;;;;;
clear gold with a nice pure white head. grassy hops in the nose with some biscuity malts. hint of sweet cracker-like malts upfront with a moderate smooth continental hop bitterness cleaning it out. finish is clean and short. mouthfeel is light and spritzy. could have a few of these when it's warm out.;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours dark and viscous. Nice foam and lacing though it was reduced a bit from aging. The beer was soo dark and thick that it stained the empty glass once consumed. 		Aroma is bourbon up front with milk and bitter chocolate in the background. Notes of vanilla and oak peek in and out. I can't keep my nose out! Easily one of the best smelling beers I've ever had. 		Taste is full on coffee, chocolate and bourbon. Very nicely complimenting each other and harmonious. 		Mouthfeel is round and rich with an almost milkshake smoothness. Slight acrid coffee astringency but it's welcome with all the sweetness. 		All around a world class beer that deserves it's spot in the top tier.		Edit: This was an 08 bottle cellared by Derek hoppymeal. Thanks for this whale of an extra. By far one of my new favorites.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to my Beer Buddy N. Ketchum for just giving me this bottle out of the kindness of his heart. You will surely receive good beer karma my friend.		Poured out of a 22 oz bottle into a snifter.		A) Deep... Deep... Brown. It is nearly black. About a finger of tan head that settles to a thin dusting. There was a bit of lacing, but it didn't last.		S) Dark roasted malt, coffee, hint of dark chocolate, and some alcohol.		T) Sweet but not so sweet that other flavors are overpowered. There are nice coffee and chocolate tastes. The hops is present in the background. There is some booze, and this is enhanced as the brew warms.		M) Medium to full bodied. It is pretty well carbonated. This beer is so smooth and very creamy. There is a warm boozy finish that is somewhat sticky. The mouth feel on this beer is superb.		O) Quite tasty.... This one sneaks up on you and then... Pow... This is a nice beer to sip, savor and enjoy.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours straw yellowwith a large foamy head that stays around and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass.		The smell is clean - floral and honeyish.		The taste is of a crisp bitterness balanced by a honeyish sweetness. Slight grassiness. Nice balance in a medium body. Sweet, fairly dry finish. Fairly creamy and smooth.		This is a nice, easy drinking ""sessionable"" lager. Tasty, clean, crisp and refreshing.";;;;;;;;;;
"I had this beer poured from a bottle into a snifter...		A: The beer pours a hazy deep golden, light amber color with a large white head...		S: Some spiciness, but mostly just a sweet sugary smell...		T: Eh, its got some of the basics, although, it could use a most yeasty character...		M: Smooth, crisp...		D: A good brew, a very good attempt at a tripel, from an American brewery, that is.";;;;;;;;;;
A - Dark brown with a red tint and half finger of tan head and okay lacing;;S - Bourbon and vanilla. Wish it was a little stronger;;T - Bourbon vanilla caramel. Pretty sweet but not overly. A little heat but not enough to make me think it was 9%;;M - Medium body with light carbonation;;D - This is damn enjoyable and pretty easy to drink. Yet another awesome beer from Founders. Why won't they distribute to Texas :(;;
This amber pale offers little head, and a mild floral aroma. Flavorwise, it's rather mild and drinkable. The centennial hops are dominating, with some piney cascade notes balancing a caramel malt flavor. This isn't a pale ale for the hop lover, but instead a more general purpose full-bodied beer that serves as a good compliment to the CBC's enjoyable meals.;;;;;;;;;;
Got this one in a trade from DrDogbeer. Thanks.;;Pours a very dark black. Although it doesn't look as viscous as the KBS. Thin tan head formed that dissapated fast but leaves some sticky lacing.;;Smell is awesome. Lots of coffee with bitter sweet chocolate. Lots of toastyness.;;Taste is awesome. Lots of coffee flavor and bitter sweet chocolate. The oats lend a smoothness that is much appreciated after the bitterness from the roasted malts and from the coffee. It tastes almost as if I'm biting down on a chocolate covered espresso bean. Very tasty.;;Mouthfeel could be a little more viscous.;;Overall I can't wait to let a few of these sit and then taste how they changed. A very good brew. Recomended.
"A- Thin tan head completely opaque with great retention, ideal at slightly below a cool temperature 45-50.		S- After a sifter of the KBS, I found the Breakfast to have mostly Chocolate aromas, with some roasted/coffee coming through as I drank it.		T- Complexity improves as it warms. Liquid Breakfast, I actually had malted pancakes before drinking this. I would even recommend trying it over vanilla ice cream or with a piece of apple crisp. It tastes roasty and chocolatey at the beginning with the dark fruit and bitterness of an imperial at the end. Worth the drive if you are within 100 miles of a distributor.		M- Definitely an oatmeal feel with the malty sweetness on the sides of the tongue. It surprised me once again how subtle any alcohol feel/dryness are left afterword. They could amp up the ABV even more and it wouldn't be turned down.";;;;;;;;;;
"had on tap at lazy boy saloon white plains NY 6/30/11	$8 per/small pint		Pours into my glass a deep dark brown that borders on black when you view it from a distance. A quarter inch of khaki head on top leaves some splotchy lacing as it falls. Aromas start off with dark fruits and toffee melding with some roast, coffee and cocoa. Piney, herbal hops make themselves known alongside dense malts.		First sip brings smooth, dense malts upfront with tons of dark fruits, toffee and roast. Notes of cocoa and coffee combine in as the brew flows down with a good hit of bitterness from pine resiny hops. Sweetness is there but is well balanced. Alcohol is well hidden also. Tasty dark barleywine.		Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with good carbonation. Pretty easy to drink considering the ABV on this one. Overall, another tasty treat from Founders and a nice twist on a standard barleywine. 		waited a long time to try this and I was in no way let down";;;;;;;;;;
"Serving Type - 22oz bottle		Appearance - Dark tan/black, creamy 1/2 head and some nice lacing.		Smell - Hops, dark fruits, roasted malts, some coffee, chocolate, plum, some sugars,molasses and licorice.		Taste - Hops right up front at the start. Roasted malts and molasses comes in with some plum, raisin and licorice. Nice hint of coffee, expresso, and some chocolate. The hop and coffee really bitter this so the added molasses flavor is needed to sweet this up.		Mouthfeel - You get the bitter hop hit at first, then coated with bitter coffee but not overwhelming at all. Touge gets hops, malts, coffee, chocolate, and bittered. Palette gets some sweet fruits and coffee at the end. Aftertaste is bitter and thick but not long lasting and too strong.		Overall - I liked this alot. Its fun to drink since its two beers in one, I was plesantly surprized at the hop character it had, but it still had enough stout to it. Tasty and easy to drink, ill have this again.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a 20oz imperial pint. Thanks to HollyAnn for the hook up!		Bottled on: Jan/Week 2 (2008 I assume)		A: Pours a hazy pale gold color with a creamy white head that's two fingers in height. Although fed by some active carbonation the head dies pretty quickly, leaving a small amount of lace behind.		S: Nice yeasty aromas of banana and clove followed closely by some tart fruit and a mild breadiness.		T: Enjoyable yeast flavors (banana, clove, and bubblegum) that have biscuit-y, bread-y, and toasted crustiness nipping on their heels. Also along for the ride is pepper and a tart and slightly sour citrus flavor that lends some balance.		M: Pretty chewy and pleasantly spicy on the tongue. Interesting peeks of dry/toasted malt.		D: Very good. I bet this is very popular around Nashville in the summertime.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Poured out a dark brown color with highlights of ruby. It had a small, tan head that left soapy trails of residue on the glass.		S - It smelled of oak, vanilla, caramel and toffee. There was a very muted bourbon aroma.		T - I picked up very little bourbon flavor. Good chocolate and caramel with a touch of vanilla.		M - It was soft and a little chewy. A medium-bodied brew with a warm alcohol presence.		D - This is a fairly easy-drinking beer. It just didn't have much of a bourbon aged feel. It makes a nice vanilla stout, though.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle thanks to Tom Peters over at Monks.		This tasty pours a hazy golden straw color with a large foamy white head. Some carbonation and a nice amount of sediment that deepened the color to an orange tone. Retention was very good and lacing was decent.		The bouquet has a reasonable amount of citrusy hops with lemons and oranges. There were some toasted malt undertones. The taste has decent hops that are balanced with a grassy-straw bite that finished with light heavy citrus and sweet malts. Nice bitter aftertaste.		The mouth feel is light and crisp. The carbonation really works for this beer, making easy to enjoy, while it does not fill. This will be a refreshing beer on ht days!! While I agree this is a bit tame for Founders, it is still a nice beer. Crisp, well balanced and tasty.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a properly-sized Carlsberg mug.		Appearance: Sort of hard to tell, as the mug is gray stoneware. As it poured out of the bottle, though, this beer had a very pale yellow hue, almost american macro-like. Nice head retention and clinging lace.		Smell: Plesant, light, fruity aroma. Not a whole lot going on, but I don't expect more from a pils.		Taste: First thing I notice is a strange, sharp bite. I'm not sure if it's just over-zealous carbonation or something weird about the hops. Once the bite fades, though, there's not much left, just a bready malt flavor that lingers on the palate. None of this is necessarily unpleasant.		Mouthfeel: I guess that the 'bite' kinda plays into the mouthfeel portion of this review. 		Drinkability: Almost like a soda, this brew is rather refreshing. While it's possibly a bit unbalanced, it would make a perfectly acceptable session beer. It's also certainly several steps up from a macro-lager and would be appropriate wherever a macro might be appropriate.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle.		Crystal clear, bright amber, with an enormous, frothy off-white head. Citrus aroma hits the nasal passages and you can tell they dumped their fair share of hops into this one. 		Toasted grain & slightly musty pale malts round out the flavor, with the hops showcasing a nice lingering bitterness. Certainly gave me my hop fix for the day..apparently they use four different hop varieties in this, and I can believe it.		Only shortfall for me was that I like a little more body to my IPAs, as this one is medium-bodied at best. That being said, it's gotta be one of the easiest drinking IPAs out there, not harsh at all..kinda like a mutt offspring of an IPA & a standard APA.		Some of O'Fallon's beers have missed the mark for me, but this one is worth trying.";;;;;;;;;;
"never been much of a fan of british comedy, but i sure love their beer. i'll take 2 pints of bitter any day of the week.		A- pours a slightly hazy copper orange apricot, very nice rocky bone-white head has great retention and lots of baby-swiss type lace all around. settles to 1/4in disk and stays that way.		S- very fruity and wine like until it warms up a bit. sherry, port, and red apples. wild strawberry, white raisin, old wine barrel, and as it warms caramel toffee/praline and bready aromas come out. sour tart yeast, and woodsy malt, herbal almost floral hops.		T- flavor seems somewhat diluted compared to the aroma, but seems to fit. well water, toffee, raw cocoa, tart bitter cranberry, white grape, aromatic resinous dried wood , grape leaves, dry chardonnay, white zinfandel, and again, as it warms, the bready malt flavors show themselves with caramel and toasted grain, and woody herbal tea like hops. if this were classified as a bitter, it might have received a higher rating from me here.		MF- soft, smooth, and refreshing slightly oily medium body, but the medium level carbonation washes it down and cleans up making way for another drink.		D- as a fan of english beer, they all are highly drinkable to me. the bottle is gimmicky and fun and that adds to the experience.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Dark blackish brown color with a nice brown head that faded quickly.		S: Smells amazing with a nice strong bourbon aroma.		T: Fairly light considering the ABV (which was listed as 10.5). But a nice strong taste of bourbon with some lighter notes of chocolate. The flavors work extremely well together, and complement each other very nicely.		M: Decently chewy, but I almost expected it to be thicker.		D: Very, very drinkable due to the great taste. Although be warned, the ABV is pretty high, and the easy taste might make you drink one too many.		Overall: I thought this was an amazing beer. I ordered several when I was out, and if i ever saw this on a menu I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone who likes a good stout or is a bourbon drinker.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a barely translucent dark brown color with better than a full finger loose light tan collar that fades slowly to sheets of Belgian lacing. The smell is a great cherry fig and molasses...that's what I'm talking about! The mouth feel is another classical example of that smooth Belgian effervescence. Tastes really good. I'm somewhat partial because I'm drawn to Belgian Strong Dark ales. I can't believe how many times that I've walked past this one...goes to show the power of graphic arts/marketing. I'm a really big fan. The NECCO chocolate, subtle cherry, earthy yeast and dark fruit flavors rock. An incredible drinker. The 8.2 ABV is well integrated. Highly recommend that you check it out.;;;;;;;;;;
"Good for Founders for bringing this one back so I could finally try it. Looking forward to warming up with one this afternoon before an awesome tasting tonight.		APPEARANCE: Pours into a Sam Adams glass black in color with a one finger tan head. It dissipates very quickly leaving behind a sturdy thick collar with some bubbly haze across the surface.		SMELL: A decent bit of roastiness pairs with some chocolate and a decent bit of caramel to form a well-rounded aroma. Black malt adds much more a bitter aroma than any hops do, as any aroma from them is pretty much non-existent.		TASTE: Black malt stands out quite a bit, but the beer is missing some of the more chocolaty flavors I've come to expect. It's got a light caramel quality to it, but a smoky nuttiness if much more prevalent. Hop flavor is there for balance, but doesn't take on many actual flavor characteristics.		MOUTHFEEL: The body is nice and medium-full without any sort of syrupy quality. Carbonation is definitely on the lower end, which isn't completely unheard of.		DRINKABILITY: Quite good. No alcohol to get in the way, and I'm nearly finished my beer already.		Not bad at all, but quite different than I'm used to. Definitely seek it out if you're a lover of porters like I am. Or even if you can appreciate all beers from a great brewery like Founders. Not a bad choice.";;;;;;;;;;
"Beer Review #100, I thought the Centennial would be appropriate-- here's to the next 100.		A- Nice copper color with an offwhite head that sticks to the perfect pint glass as it settles. An unfiltered IPA with very fine sediment that is only visible when held to the light.		S- All hops with lemon and pine shining through.		T- white grapefruit up front, followed by a pleasantly striking aftertaste are the first things I notice. Also get notes of toastiness that make this seem balanced. 		M- medium bodied, some residual carbonation, finishes pretty dry.		D- Another solid regular offering from Founders, a very nice unfiltered IPA, I'll definitely pick this one up again, or better yet find a place around here to try it on tap.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Pours a very deep black with almost no head and minimal lacing		S: A huge explosion of coffee, maple, oats, and a touch of booze	 	T: Chocolate, maple brown sugar, wood, boozy, and a nice hint of vanilla 		M: Robust and yet very smooth and goes down so easy for a beer around 10%.	 	D: This is as close to a perfect beer as you can get in my opinion. I'm very happy to hear that they are bottling this soon.";;;;;;;;;;
Bottle dated 12/28/10. Poured into NB globe, color is golden peach with a tiny white head that fades quickly to a creamy collar with nice lacing. Smell is citrus hops, grapefruit, bubble gum, tropical fruit, pineapple. A great showcase of American hops. Taste follows smell, very bitter but lots of citrus fruit, lemon zest, grapefruit, pine, some pineapple, a touch of pale malt some alcohol and a bitter spicy hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light medium carbonation, finishes pretty clean. A very drinkable beer, this is my favorite founders brew. This one is right up there with Elder, the best east coast example of the style.;;;;;;;;;;
Appearance: Pale golden slightly hazed body paired with bright white nice sized head dwindles slowly leaving specks of lacing. Aroma: Nice noble hop bouquet Tettanag and Halletau paired with a crisp pale malt sweetness very nice biscuit malt presence to note as well. Taste: Very good German style pils floral and herbal hops with the slight biscuit toned malts blend into one insanely refreshing pils. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied crisp mouthfeel carbonation was a bit high but didn't hurt drinkability. Drinkability: Nice easy going flavorful lager pairs nicely with food glad to see Stoudt's finally deliver this offering in bottles.;;;;;;;;;;
12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a deep brown/black with a finger of tight bubbled tan head. Bottle conditioned. Dark malts, chocolate along with a bit of citrus hops in the aroma. Lighter sided of medium bodied. More chocolate malt and maybe some black patent in the flavor. Decent amount of hop bitterness. Dry malty finish with the chocolate malt lingering. Instead of a black IPA, just a black PA or is that an oxymoron! Very drinkable beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter.		Appearance: Pours a dark red color, almost like blood. There is a finger of very pink head that fades quickly.		Smell: Sweet but very natural raspberries. Just a little tart.		Taste: Sweet but not too overpowering. Lots of tart natural raspberry with lots of fruit in the finish.		Mouthfeel: Medium body with smooth carbonation and a mildly dry finish.		Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. The alcohol was well hidden, and the flavor wasn't artificial at all. I would definitely have another if I get the chance.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a great deep brown/copper color with great head and nice lacing; nearly opaque. Huge malt aroma with nice caramel undertones. Deep malt and wonderful caramel tastes; wonderfully deep and sweet flavor with a tiny hit of hops at the end for a nice finish; just a bit of peat in the flavor would've made it perfect. Slight alcohol tinge to it, but very smooth.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.		A: Clear, deep, radiant ruby body underneath an inch of moderately textured tan foam; average retention and light lacing. Scores points just for it's fantastic color.		S: Nice, smooth, balanced malt. Nutty, chocolatey, and thoroughly sweet without intimating cloyingness. Pretty good, if a bit low on complexity.		T: Follows the nose, but just a touch less refined. Still, the nuttiness comes through well, and the finish shows just a bit of hop bitterness to keep things clean. Not bad at all.		M: A little watery, but helped out with a good amount of smooth carbonation. Still, definitely too thin for my tastes.		D: Truly a session beer in every sense of the word - I never would have guessed the ABV was quite as low as it is, though. So I guess that should count against it here, since I usually give beers bonus points for hiding their alcohol.		Notes: While far from exciting, this is a pretty tasty, inoffensive offering from one of the better breweries in the mid-south (I do wish that were saying more, but give Yazoo some respect). This one's worth a shot if you're not in the market for anything remotely extreme.		Cheers!";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours pitch black in color with a 1/2 inch creamy brown head that looked like a chocolate milkshake and faded slowly to average and left a ring around the top of the beer with good spotty lacing sliding down the glass slowly; there was an oil slick/spill appearance on top which looked like the Gulf of Mexico a few years back.		Smells of roasted coffee, cocoa, chocolate, rum or bourbon, light vanilla, burnt wood, molasses, burnt grains, sweet roasted malt, caramel, toffee, and a syrupy sweetness that reminds me of a coffee pot spiked with booze that was left on the stove too long in an old coffee pot. With that being said, this aroma was delicious and so inviting to me that as I was sipping the beer I was savoring the aroma at the same time. An excellent smelling beer, and what I had hoped for in an Imperial Stout from Founders. 		The taste was equally as impressive as the aroma, with the same components in the flavor: it starts out with sweet roasted malt, roasted coffee, molasses, cocoa, toffee, chocolate, and then come the syrupy sweetness that then leads to a slight bitterness from what tastes like citrus hops mixed with a burnt Starbucks French Roast. It felt like there was a chalky residue on my tongue after the swallow, like I had just licked dry charcoal but it left a sweet cocoa powder instead of burnt wood; really quite an odd sensation that was a pleasure on my tastebuds and very tasty. Then there are the flavors of bourbon, light vanilla like it was aged in wood or a barrel, burnt wood, brown sugar, hot fudge, and some light dark fruits that were so repressed by the toasted coffee and roasted malts that I couldn't even make them out. As this beer warmed it got better, more complex, and yet stayed true to all of the sweet roasted flavors that made the initial taste blast so delicious. Quite simply, this is an excellent tasting beer and one that I slowed down to enjoy more so I wouldn't finish the whole glass so quickly. 		Mouthfeel is creamy, slick and smooth, to the point of being almost watery; the body is medium to heavy, but the carbonation is almost non-existent and flows down like water, or as easy as a Guinness in beer terms. 		Extremely high drinkability, as the 10.5% ABV barely peeks through, even with the slight bourbon flavor coming through in waves throughout this masterpiece. For any stout lover or coffee lover out there, this is a must try beer which I thought was excellent overall. A very high recommendation and a beer that I hope to have again soon.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a dark brown color with a nice two finger head. Lacing sticks nicely to the glass. The nose is hoppy, and malty with some dried fruit thrown in there. A bit of booze lingers at the end of the whiff. Definitely an invitation to deliciousness. The taste does not disappoint still very hoppy (given its release date) with a robust malt backbone. It finishes bitter and leaves a nice warming sensation. I had this beer when it first came out on tap and I think it has improved immensely in the bottle over a couple of months. It is much smoother now. The mouthfeel is light and slightly flat, however I think that it balances well with the rich nature of this beer. I do not think I could drink more than one in a sitting, but I am really enjoying this right now.;;;;;;;;;;
765 ml bottle, purchased at the brewery. Brilliant amber red color topped by a small but firm off white head. Nose is not strong, but some deep malt notes vie with light hops. Slight chocolate note in taste. Malty and clean, not overwhelmingly sweet. A little hop tingle in aftertaste.  A fine example of the style.;;;;;;;;;;
"Freshness date on the six-pack box wasn't clear, but obviously this is the present year's batch and it is fresh. Website description, ""like pumpkin pie in a bottlewe add real pumpkin to the mash and then season the finished beer with cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.""		Appearance: Slightly hazy burnt orange color. Little head development, retention, and no discernable amount of lacing.		Smell: Pumpkin pie aptly describes the nose. The spices come across well, but are not overbearing. I give high marks in this category for the aroma is well done, considering the beer's base and good use of spice additives.		Taste & Mouthfeel: A bit thin bodied, which makes for a mild drinking experience. The flavor is as expected--pumpkin with spices along with the graininess that comes with lighter beer territory.		Drinkability: Something to appreciate during autumn, but not something that knocks my socks off. Still it is a solid pumpkin ale that is worth a try.		Notes: O'Fallon changed the label last year and it is different than the one pictured. My second review of this beer on BA, which resulted in the same overall score.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Light straw color and very clear. Head was about a finger high when first poured and very light and foamy. Excellent lacing.		Smell: Dried malts and sulfur.		Taste: A nice malt flavor with a little hop to balance it out. A slight hop aftertaste gives it some bitterness, but also gives it a nice crisp feel to it.		Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and crisp. 		Drinkability: This would be a good summer beer for those days by the pool.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. This beer pours like a thick black motor oil. It is opaque with almost no color at the edges. A 1/2 inch mocha colored head forms and leaves a pleasant lacing around the edge.		The aroma at cooler temperatures seems to be dominated by chocolate and coffee and warms to include a healthy dose of alcohol. The malty goodness definitely comes through. The could have been more strength in the aroma. 		The taste includes large notes of coffee with a good under-belly of dark chocolate. A nice level of hops sits in the background. The bitter coffee lingers on the tongue nicely. As with the smell, the alcohol becomes slightly more prominent.	 	The mouthfeel at cooler temperatures was a bit creamier than my preference although it did improve nicely. It is fairly full bodied with a mild stickiness left on the lips. The hops/coffee combo leaves a nice sensation on your tongue.		Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. The primary issue I had was the feel because I think the aroma, taste, and appearance are great. I will look forward to enjoying more and seeing how it gets better with age.";;;;;;;;;;
"500ml brown bottle, the BB date is 05 July 06.		A: in a goblet it pours a clear, copperish hue, with very thin beer head settling fast to a rim of foam; restrained carbonation.	S: quite sweetish malty upfront, decorated with a deeply floral and slightly stinky-hayish hoppy note (said to be Liberty hops), with a candyish orange-peel and tropical fruity note sustaining at the back. Not very complex but very rich.	T: upfront is predominantly malty, slightly toffeeish, with some chewy-nuts, but fast turning to profoundly earthy and herbal bitter taste, along with a horizontal malty flavour in parallel on the palate; a small amount of refreshing hops hide at the back, while the well-lingering bitter aftertaste overwhelms the palate and surrounds the whole mouth.	M: refreshing mouthfeel for sure, supported by the seemingly gentle but materially lively fizz, quite like a fresh barrel of real ale; the finish is quite clean, crisp and allows the bitterness to assume itself freely.	D: good balance between (a bit too) sweet malts and profound bitterness, making it a very drinkable bitter even at the strength of 6.0%abv. without any unwanted alcoholic mouthfeel. A solid brew.";;;;;;;;;;
"Growler from Party Town. Pours a clear, reddish copper color. Nice white fluffy head. Pretty good retention, and lace. 		Caramel malt aroma. Some spicy and earthy notes, fitting for rye. Some citrus and pine hop notes softly in the background. 		Solid caramel malt background. A nice layer of spicy rye, combined with some earthy bitterness. Some citrus notes fall softly in the background. 		Medium body, a good amount of carbonation. Alcohol pretty well hidden. This is a pretty nice beer, especially for the price.";;;;;;;;;;
"This beer in under rated. keep in mind that this is a craft beer from argentina. It's not overly hopped, it's a properly made english red ale.		appearance: pours amber orange verus red. nice head and rentention.		smell: nice caramel smell as expected. no hop detection.		taste: low bitterness, but a nice malty, and caramel dominate, subtle sweet, some apple flavor, nice and hefty beer.		mouthfeel: medium body		drinkability: well done craft beer from an area of the world that we dont see much. Good to see they are getting into the craft kick too. Nice beer and well crafted. Surprised thi sis only a B-, but it's not hoppy and only hoppy beers get rated good here.";;;;;;;;;;
"We are just starting to see Founders around here, and for that we are very happy. If you see this beer and are thinking of trying it, do it.		This beer is one of the best IPA's I have tasted in a while. It has a nice amber but cloudy color and an incredible hoppy aroma, from the first sip you are in for something special.		It has a somewhat bitter aftertaste, but nothing that lingers. It is a bit stronger than typical IPA's and almost seems like a double IPA.		I picked up a six pack and haven't seen it since, I don't think they can keep it on the shelf.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a 20oz imperial pint.		A: Pours a hazy, warm, glowing gold color with a creamy, off-white, two finger head. Good head retention and lots of lace sheeting.		S: Aromas of bready malt, piney hops, caramel apples, and dusty/earthy toasted malt.		T: Nicely bitter, piney hops compliment, nicely, the toasted/bready/caramel malt flavors that wash all over the tongue. The finish turns out slightly sweet and caramel-y.		M: Dry and bitter to start but ends up slightly fuller and sweeter at the finish. 		D: Very drinkable and quite refreshing. Would be great in the summer when the beer store is out of their Centennial IPA (perish the thought!).";;;;;;;;;;
Poured into a Corsendonk Christmas Ale glass a very nice black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger fizzy tan head, which left some small islands and sticky lacing. The nose is big and malty, lots of dark chocolate, toffee, and caramel, with some figs, raisins, plums. The taste is sweet at first, big malts, dark chocolate/fruits, slightly bitter, with a dry finish. Full-Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a awesome tasting brew, surprised the shit out of me, never really cared for the Pike brew's, but this is an exception, highly recommended.;;;;;;;;;;
"I had seen on twitter (@mpbrew) that they had just released their Saison a day or two prior to my visit and that was just what I wanted on this balmy end-of-summer afternoon. 		Ice-cold with a touch of fruity yeast, a handful of doughy malts, a modest yet kissable hop-bite and a bright lemon-pepper zest made this glass of beer a winner. In fact, of the three I drank (plus the two others I sampled) this was by far my favorite offering.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle poured at Belgique tasting, Hugo MN Thanksgiving 2010.		Dark ruby brew. Fine bubbles. Delicious tangy raspberry aroma, with an earthy leaf must underlying. Tart and extreme raspberry...incredible lack of any alcohol heat given the greater than 12% ABV. Brett provides a mushroomy flavor. A rich maltiness and slick and sticky mouthfeel. Truly a unique and fabulous brew!";;;;;;;;;;
"Presented from the tap in a simple ""tear drop"" glass the beer was a dark brown near black color innitially but settled to a bright ruby red about half way through the sample. Presented with no head, leaving no lacing, and no signs of carbonation. All in all, not an ""eye candy"" beer by any stretch of the imagination.		The nose was sweet and ripe with mollasses and syrup like honey aroma. Earthy and the smell of freshly churned garden dirt. Slightly smokey and medicinal.		The taste is of sweet malt made sweeter with honey that leaves a good mouthfeel on the palate. Some earthy and smokey flavors, very herbal and medicinal. No hop character as expected, and the smokey flavor increases slightly as the beer warms. Very subtle chocolate and vanilla flavors towards the end with an smooth if not somewhat syrupy finish.		Medium body with little carbonation.		An interesting style and one most are probably unfamiliar with. I know I am not and I approached the beer with an open mind having little if nothing to compare it to. Alone, it was a good beer. Slightly alla dopplebock, slightly alla rauchbier; this is for sure an interesting an enjoyable beer. I would say I would not rush to find as many of these as possible and drink them, but I would not shy away from the style when it presents itself either.";;;;;;;;;;
"on tap at the Birch in Norfolk, Va		a - off-amber with huge white head that refused to be gone. lacing would be an understatement.		s - light smoke, the twang of an almost-sour, grapes, german skunk (the good kind.). 		t - light german malts with that helles feel, smoke, but not obnoxiously so. a great balance of flavor and smoke. I'm sure there are hops, oh wait, I'm getting them on the finish. Light bitterness follows.		m - light body, only mild bitterness and a whisp of smoke remains. 		o - one of the more enjoyable smoke beers I've had, in that the smoke is minimal but present. Its light and crisp nature lends to some immense drinkability. Interesting and repeatable.";;;;;;;;;;
Merry Christmas to me! Enjoyed on christmas morning in my Surly Darkness goblet. Pours a thick oily black with a creamy mocha head. Smell- Lots of dark chocolate and roasty goodness. Taste- Coffee roast and ash balanced off with lactic sourness from the oats. Chocolate is actually subdued in the taste. Very creamy mouthfeel which finishes dry and bitter. Definitely an eye opener;;;;;;;;;;
"Got this in pints at a pub while in London; one of the best ""real ales"" I had there, and I had many, of course! Unfortunately, I couldn't find any in bottles to bring home!		Some of the descriptions here say they aren't sure how to categorize it; it is categorized in England as a Strong ale, which means over 5% alcohol. I would categorize it as a brown ale, based on taste, color and body.		Nice toasty, roasty, malty, coffee, chocolate, etc., nose and taste, touch of sweetness and hoppy bitterness, just like you would expect in a good brown ale. Excellent brew to have relaxing in a pub. One good reason to go back to England!";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a ""bomber"" bottle into a wine goblet.	Deep, dark burgundy in color, with a rather short head of pink foam. Quite a surprise, not what I expected this beer to look like at all.	Aroma-Wildflowers and crushed rasperries.	Taste-Full-on rasperries, tart, subtle Belgian spiciness. Almost like a glass of fortified wine or a Raspberry Lambic. That being said, this is a very refreshing and drinkable brew that hides the high(9.2)ABV. very well. If there are any hops to speak of in this Belgian Strong Pale Ale, they are effectively drowned out by the intense raspberry flavor. The Blushing Monk would make an outstanding dessert beer, either on its own or with anything sweet.";;;;;;;;;;
"43% ABV - this is so crazy!		A: Pour is warm amber with absolutely no head.		S: Vineous and syrupy. Lots of dark dried sweet fruits. Alcohol. Kind of burnt. 		T: Complex and vineous. Sweet caramell and dark dried fruits. Alcohol. Some smoke. Reminds me of an exclusive aged port. 		M: Full body and no carbonation. Alcohol is very present in this syrupy ""beer"". Aftertaste stays for some time and is mostly sweet. 		O: I had about 2-3 cl, that amount is great. But to drink a whole glass... Out of the question. Very complex and interesting.";;;;;;;;;;
"Motor oil. Plain and simple. Thick, black, almost gooey looking. There are a couple of dark tan bubbles forming an island in the middle of the black sea. Even though there really wasn't a head, there is still some rather nice lacing ringing the glass.		The smell is of burnt cowboy coffee, woody bourbon, and some dark fruit. Slight hint of wet cardboard...uh oh. It's very slight, though, and way in the background.		The flavor is of the same strong coffee and bourbon in the aroma. Fairly strong bitterness. The bourbon flavor is there, behind the coffee, but it does not have the alcohol quality to go along with it (nice). No taste of the hint of oxidation I was smelling, thank goodness.		Mouthfeel is full and heavy. Very slick and oily. Aftertaste is a little bit bitter and the alcohol hits me in the back of my throat after swallowing. Warms the belly nicely on a cold night. I can't seem to remember who sent this one to me, but thanks!";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a Weizen glass.		A: Super cloudy deep straw. A big eggshell head starts strong and sticks around. Leaves a fair amount of lace.		S: Lots of lemon and clove, plus a bit of banana.		T: Tart and dry. Starts with a dry biscuit flavor. Bitterness is there with a mild lemon and clove bite. Banana resides in the background. Finishes with a lingering clove flavor.		M: The body feels grainy, with a high level of biting carbonation.		D: A nice Hefe overall. I'm glad I picked it up.";;;;;;;;;;
"(Special thanks to CRJMellor for a great trade)		This is the thickest-looking stout Ive ever poured. Completely opaque blackness with a toasted chocolate head. You ever get some chocolate from a candy bar on your fingers and then accidentally smear some chocolate on a piece of paper? Thats how the head looks.		Smells like COFFEE! Chocolate, too. And mocha. Im drinking this very close to room temperature and the sheer complexity of its odor is astounding. Its like several types of stout all rolled in to one and with no conflicting scents. Absolutely wonderful.		Flavor starts out with coffee electricity, a dark roasted malt middle with strong nodes of a dark, bitter chocolate, ending with a more milk chocolate sweetness, an oatmeal stout finish, very dry with a slightly sour hint. 		This beer is like candy. Like one of those iced mochas they sell at Starbucks only better. As strange as it may sound, this incredibly flavorful and highly-alcoholic stout would actually make a great cross over beer. Its that tasty, and that inoffensive. 		Great stuff. Perfection. Please please please start distributing to Iowa or Illinois so I can drink it more often.		I don't like giving out fives. Something sticks in the back of my throat, sputtering, making me really question myself ""Is this beer good enough? Is it really perfect? Why don't you just take the mouthfeel down a notch?"" I've put in a lot of thought, and giving this beer anything other than a perfect score would be a lie. Buy some. Right now.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks seaoflament...		Aroma is exactly what I hoped for. Awesome mix of chocolate, coffee..vanilla, more chocolate...roasted grains		This one tastes just like it smells. Very nice balance of flavors. It has depth. I'm loving this one. It is very hard to keep from drinking to fast.		As it warms it opens up even more. Mouthfeel is creamy.		I'm looking forward to trying more of this one.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Poured a crisp copper and tanned gold color with very slight crimson shading. The head was small and dissipated quickly leaving zero lacing. Sat in the glass transparent and unassuming. 		S: Picked up some initial pepper and spiced aromas. Some herbs and caramel malts as well. The most surprising thing about the nose was the lack of alcohol (considering the ABV).		T: Decent but there are no hard hitting tastes popping out which makes it tough to put into words. Relatively sweet and sharp with a nice honey quality. There is a bitterness here as well. Regardless, I find the taste enjoyable and even more pronounced as it warms to room temperature. 		M: Slick mouth feel with moderate carbonation. Just a tad thin. 		D: There were four reasons I picked up this beer: the country, the price, the huge red tag that said 9.5% ABV, and the intriguing, arousing, and yet disturbing label. As someone who loves both lobster and the female form I can't complain about the bottle graphics while strange, even for me. I would drink more of this beer and maybe even give it a spin with lobster.";;;;;;;;;;
"Finally got to get a try of this stuff at the Brewers Guild Fest in Ann Arbor 2010. It was one beer that brought me to this fest with such excitement. 		Pours out really really solid black with a creamy, dark reddish tan head. 		The maple here stands out super nicely as does the bourbon. Lots of oats, vanilla, bourbon, maple, roast and maybe a little alcohol from it all. It smells absolutely delicious. 		Taste is even better. This is a very roasty beer but its sweetened up a lot by maple, vanilla, oak, oatmeal and chocolate. Coffee, alcohol and intense roast flavors bitter it down. The result is a very nicely balanced, but very big, beer.		I can now rest happily having gotten to try this. Only thing now is I want more...";;;;;;;;;;
"A- Pours a near black with a thin, though persistant, tan head. Good lacing.	S- The smell is rather chocolatey and coffee like, with definite smoke wafts.	T- Smokey right away, and the nice wood smoke. Chocolate malt plays a big role with coffee and hop flavors lingering in the background.	M- Slightly full body, good carbonation. 	D- For a smoke beer and one at 9%, this is quite drinkable. I will daresay it's the best beer I've had from Yazoo to date. Really dug it and could definitely enjoy a few more.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle into pint glass		Pours clear brassy copper / gold with two fingers of aggrssive foamy offwhite head. Sheets of lace coat the sides of my glass.		Scent is distinctly oranges, grapefruit and citrus, and fresh bread, and floral		Taste is strongly oranges and citrus hops, grapefruit hops, floral and slightly spicy. Even sweet sugary pineapple and tropical fruits! Sweet and oily. Hint of spice. White pepper? Mild bitterness. This is not a hop bomb with respect to bitterness though it is clearly packed with aroma hops and hop flavor.		Mouth is juicy and a bit oily, creamy and viscous medium - on the heavier side thereof.		Drinkability is fantastic.		Wow this is a fantastic IPA. Fresh and juicy, vibrant and colorful, eminently quaffable. WOW!";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Drie Fonteinen tumbler. 		Hazy titanium yellow body (which catches the shadows forming a beautiful mysterious gradient) with an incredibly dense pillow of magnolia cream. Heavy persistent head and rich creamy lacing.		Pale malt, asian pear, and a hint of citrus in the nose. A vaguely tropical lager...		Tastes very much like a well done APA, with a nice balance of pale malt and low hop bitterness. The ginger adds to the refreshing character, but isn't readily detectable at first (lacks any ""bite""). Medium-dry finish - very clean and extremely quaffable. I can imagine hibiscus and beets working in small quantities, though I think they omitted those for this version...		Light bodied, pillowy, smooth and moderately carbonated.		Don't go into this expecting a ginger beer (despite its name) as it has little in common with that spicy soft drink. This is a wonderful session ale though, and worth seeking out if you are a fan of light yet flavorful lagers. Would obviously go perfectly with sushi.";;;;;;;;;;
"16.9oz Euro style bottle without freshness dating. Appearance is a very dark brown that has a decent tan head with good retention. The aroma is a light roasted malt scent. Flavors of brown sugar, molasses, and bittersweet chocolate are present. The finish is mildly astringent, but the taste profile is smooth overall. Body is medium and it hides the alcohol well in the taste and mouthfeel.		I'll admit that this is only my second Baltic style porter I've tried (the other being the not so good Williamsburg Porter), so I can't compare it adequately to it's brethren, yet it is a pretty good beer nevertheless. In sumnation I have to say this is a porter with some bock characteristics and is quite quaffable.";;;;;;;;;;
"On-tap at Concordia Ale House, Portland, OR. $3.75/pint.		Unsure of what an ""Imperial Brown"" might taste like, I started with a small taster, which my wife sipped on, too. We both really liked the sample alot, so I decided to get a full pint.		A: Excellent rich brown with a 1/2 finger creamy tan head.		S: Little smell - subtle caramel malt and dark chocolate. 		T: Rich full flavor of chocolate, malty caramel and well-placed bitter hops. Very nice character to this beer, a brown ale with a bigger body and stronger attributes. 		M: Creamy and smooth. Carbonation level seems low - nice lingering sweetness - not sticky.		D: With great flavor and balance this is a very appealing brown ale. I'd definitely have this again.";;;;;;;;;;
"Not a bad porter, but not great. It had a nice dark color to it with all right lacing. Good scent, a nice dark aroma with very strong coffee hints. Unfortunately, the strong coffee hints went over into the taste as well, and were overpowering to the point of taking over everything else. It goes down fine, but is not the best porter out there.		EDIT -- so much better! A very rich and smooth cask porter with great roasted grains, and the coffee flavors/scents were much lower and better. Fantastic!";;;;;;;;;;
"2003 vintage sampled on tap at Anam Cara. Also sampled at the brewpub (ABV 4.7%).		This heather ale poured a cloudy, reddish-amber color with rich, white foam that was long lasting. The smell was biscuity malt, cinnamon, and a bit of a floral character (heather?). The taste was malty and floral with some cinnamon-like spiciness. Overall a rather mild heather flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and low carbonation feel. Relatively clean, but with a biscuity aftertaste. This was a very enjoyable ale and left me wanting more.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a bright yellow golden color with a light two finger bubbly head.		The smell is of HOPS!!! Tons of citrus hops with some grass and straw aromas as well.		Taste is grapefruit and citrus hops smacking you in the palate. The hops absolutely dominate here. Fantastic IIPA, I very to Founders Harvest Ale in taste but much more hoppy. Not too much malt present going on here. Definitely a top tasting IIPA, so much hop goodness. 		Mouthfeel is smooth and relatively light for an IIPA. Very crisp finish.		Very drinkable, alcohol is detectable though coming in at 9.4%. One of the best IIPAs out there, absolutely delicious.";;;;;;;;;;
"The beer poured deep golden amber with a slight haze and with a compact off-white head that fell slowly to lace the glass.		The aroma was smoky and malty with dark fruits and caramel.		The flavor was smoky with just a slight sourness way in the back. The maltiness expectation from the aroma just doesn't show, also no noticeable presence of alcohol.		The finish was just dry and smoky into the aftertaste. The body was medium.		16.9 ounce bottle. For a 7% beer, you could drink a ton of this. Unfortunately the flavor just isn't malty enough to balance the smokiness. Would make a nice bitter without the smokiness, still makes a nice ale.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bought this 22 oz. bomber bottle at a wine shop last winter. I was recently surprised to also find it in the cooler of my local liquor store.		Pours black with dark crimson edges. The dark tan head dissipates into a nice foamy ring. Aroma of roasted malts, oats and grains with some grassy hop notes.		Tastes big. Bigger than the aroma suggests. There's complexity here. Raisins and cocoa, spices, plums and roasted malts. Hops are there but very subtle. 		Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than expected but it all works together with taste and aroma. 		All things considered...this is an incredibly easy drinking intermediate stout. Not too soft, not too hard, just right.";;;;;;;;;;
This was my first venture into Founders Beer. I hope to do a lot more. This was a good IPA. I have to say to begin, this is not my favorite IPA, but I would definitely drink it again. This beer has this apple-ish flavor. It pours dark yellow, slightly hazy but mostly clear. Thin head, doesn't quite cover the top of the beer. Aroma was strong to begin and fell away as the head fell away. This is a very drinkable IPA, bitterness builds as you drink it. Never overwhelming.;;;;;;;;;;
"I, like some of the others here got excited about finding this bottle being labeled as a ""winter"" brew, and then experienced sadness when I found out it was only a Vienna Lager...but after drinking this I am a happy man. Maybe the mood was just right but this one really hit the mark tonight. Nothing unrealistic in relation to the style just a pleasant example. Sweet aroma, very bready/biscuity with a hint of stinging sour fruit. Beautiful light amber pour with a frothy head and a nice ring of lacing at the top. Sharp mouthfeel, clean and simple. Nice toasted flavor mixed in with an ample helping of sweet malt. Lightly hopped supplying a quick burst of bitterness. Doesn't excel in any category but overall I give it a deserving 8 for sheer enjoyment.";;;;;;;;;;
"Deep copper/amber hue with a lovely 1 1/2"" pillowy cap that slowly (slightly) dwindles leaving nice lacing behind		Aroma: Wow...sweet hoppy caramel malts all in one...apple juice...grapes and bready malts		Taste: nice sweet apple juice...honey suckle bready notes....not as deep in musty as you may find with some other doppels...nice balance between hop and malt though...and smooth it is		Mouthfeel: very smooth and without question a good candidate for sessioning..		Overall: Quite a nice doppel....";;;;;;;;;;
"Serving- 12 oz bottle, 45F, no date.	A: Poured a golden color with suspended yeast. Maybe I should have reserved some beer in the bottle? Moderate beige head that died down and left a minimal layer of foam. Plenty of lacing. The foam layer really persists. Fully carbonated. Cloudy appearance can be typical for the style.	S: A light hop aroma that blends with the malt aroma. Reminds me of apple and pear fruit with spice. Not a grassy aroma. No odors or diacetyl. I would have scored a 4.5 if the aroma had more presence.	T: Clean malt up front with hop flavor and bitterness in the finish. I was left with a sweet sensation on the tip of my tongue with a lingering bitter taste at the base. The bitterness was not biting and was balanced well for the style.	Pre-digestive reflection: Persistent, crisp hops. This is the way hops should taste. Overall, a good representation of the style. Now I know what American IPA is all about (+0.5).	M: Medium body. Fully carbonated with no carbonic bite. Bubbly, smooth and silky (+0.5). Almost as silky as a Trappist Rochefort 10. Dry, but not too dry. Not astringent. An impressive mouthfeel.	D: The mouthfeel, hop finish and hop balance make this beer a good experience. Its not too strong, either.	Notes: With a clean crisp, basic flavor, the hops and mouthfeel make this beer a special one. If I had to explain to a newbie what hops taste like, I would use this beer as an illustration.";;;;;;;;;;
"I have frequented Party Town in Florence, KY for a few months now and have been impressed with the knowledge and information they provide about beer.		I was suprised to find that they actually put on Rye 75 on their growler station which they designed the recipe for and brewed through BBC. They indicated they will have 8 half barrels coming of this and I highly encourage folks to give it a try.		It's a Rye IPA		A - Looks like very dark ice tea with beautiful lacing and about 4 finger lengths of head with a direct pour into the glass		S - Smell has apricots or peach coming through for me which is a first. Very strong aroma coming through on this one		T - Fantastic as an IPA. It has bitterness throughout but isn't drying like some IPAs		M - Sits on the palate very well. I really enjoy the feel of this beer		D - Could have more than one of these. Good thing, I have a full growler because I believe I will likely have a few of these. 		I'm excited to see if Party Town gets into brewing any other beers. This RYE IPA is quite impressive. The price is only $5.99 for a refill and $7.99 for a new jug. You can't beat the price for the quality.";;;;;;;;;;
This one pours an orange color with tons of head that stick around for a while and leave plenty of lacing on the glass. Beware the overflow of foam in the glass. The aroma is filled with grapefruit and pine hops along with some spiciness. The flavor is much the same. Tons of hop flavors - mostly grapefruit and pine. Hints of malt, but lots of hops. Very resinous. The hop flavors stick around in the mouth. The body is pretty full and the drinkability is ok.;;;;;;;;;;
brown and thick-looking. small head that receeds to just a coating of small bubbles. looks like a glass of watered down maple syrup. sweet odor with hints of chocolate bars, ginger, pine, toffee, oak, ethanol and dates. Very delicious taste. sweetness is the first flavor along with kind of a sharp alcohol bite, but this quickly mellows to a fantastic mix of chocolate, cherries, oak, dates and a fudgey/caramelly blend. Extremely smooth mouthfeel. Way to go again, Founder's. Im looking forward to my first breakfast stout and my second kentucky breakfast, both of which are burning holes in my DBF.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a flute and even though the head wasn't much, despite a healthy pour, the color is a dirty blonde with excellent clarity and lots of bubbles racing to the top.		Aromas are delightful: white grape, honey, yeast, and something reminding of pilsner malt.		The flavors are incredible, aided by a light, creamy mouthfeel and a finish that reminds of the funkier Belgian yeast strains meeting orange rind. The flavors themselves are so well-mingled and unique, it seems almost an insult to the beer to dissect it too much. But ok: there's strong honey and white grape; it's floral and earthy; yeastiness comes into the flavor and carries through to the finish; all the while I'm reminded of Belgian saisons, white wine, and even champagne (the latter two largely due to the pleasant dryness). It's complex, and a little bit of a challenge to figure out. I know I love it.		I'm not sure I ""know"" this beer after two bottles, but I will revisit it many times, and will certainly buy more than two bottles next run. It's a pleasant sipper, light yet surprisingly complex, and along with their Tripel, my favorite Stoudts offering so far.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - It comes in as a dark liquid, impenetrable by light 		S - Strong smell of coffee and perhaps some chocolate 		T - Rich and creamy, full and complex. It tastes strongly of coffee with hints of something slightly sweet - maybe chocolate? It does have some bitterness, but it is hardly noticeable. 		M - It is smooth, creamy, easy on the tongue, and goes down easily. 		O - This is a wonderfully creamy and rich beer that I wish were more widely available. (At the time of this review, I believe it is only available in Wisconsin)";;;;;;;;;;
"Light/medium bodied, clear golden color with a nice white head. 		Aroma is sweet toasted malt, hay, and a bit of hops spice. 		Taste is somewhat sweet and malty with a very nice crisp hops finish. 		Very well balanced, smooth and very easy to drink. This was perfect with barbecue. 		Definitely one of the best of the Pilsner or lager beers.";;;;;;;;;;
"Simply Beer BIF from Mike (mcallister) shoots another good one my way. A fine example of an IPA.		Clear amber pour, sticky tan head laying sheets of lace. Umm, the infamous citrusy pine, woody and vinous. Sharp and crisp hop bomb, she is, underlying dry pine all blended together well. No one taste jumps out to smack you.		Tingly in the mouth, a bit semi-antiseptic to clear the palate quickly. A fine drinking summer session beer  although a tad big for a real long haul.";;;;;;;;;;
"The folks at the brewery (thanks, Chris) told me this is a seasonal right now, but if it gets more hype and people keep drinking it, it may become a year-round brew.		Appearance: A copper amber color with nice soapy lacing rimming the imperial pint glass, good head retention throughout, a lot of carbonation shooting toward the top of the glass. 		Smell: A nice balance between husk and earthy notes, fruit and berries, some sour cherries, and some citrus tones from the hops. 		Taste: I would've guessed this was more than 4.0% ABV, but alas, it's not. I could see this being a monster imperial pale ale, as the flavors here are extremely balanced, with the fruit and citrus dominating, and the earthy husk notes giving a nice backbone, all with a nicely lingering finish. 		Mouthfeel: Lighter-bodied even though the color's darker, but still remains crisp and not too carbonated, which I was worried about at first from the appearance. 		Drinkability: Highly sessionable, with the flavors balanced, the alcohol fairly low, and the flavors better as they warm. I could probably drink this stuff all day, but unfortunately I don't live in Savannah. Try it if you get the chance. It won't blow your mind, but it's a very solid brew, and once I could drink a lot of.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance - a medium golden beer with nice white head. Head doesn't last long when poured into a pilsner glass.		Smell - this beer doesn't have a strong smell at all. You can smell the hops and a little spice.		Taste - A little citrus, a little spice, a little sweet.		Mouthfeel - Very smooth.		Drinkability - It is good when drank really cold. As far as a pilsner, there are better out there. It is decent, and I can easily drink a couple. The flavor grows on you after you finish the first.";;;;;;;;;;
"The color is a dark brune, with copper reflexes. It has a brownish head, beautiful on the top, not the same on the side. Good persistence.	The nose is a prepotent smoked. Prepotent, but non overwhelming. Very pleasant. Wood smoke, ash. Good!	At the taste the smoked is less prepotent, and the malty notes come out well. But the smoke comes back and it is very long in the aftertaste.	Good body, adeguate.	In the aftertaste, beside the smoked, there is also an herbal note.	Very good!";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into regular pint glass.		A - Poured dark mahogany color with small head that quickly dissipated leaving light lacing around the glass.		S - Mostly malts, toffee, caramel and cherries.		T - Sweet malts to start that gradually turn to cherry, caramel, butterscotch and some dark fruits.		M - Medium bodied with high carbonation.		O - Very good malty brew that I would highly recommend.";;;;;;;;;;
"Had a chance to pick this up via the single bottle a few weeks back. I had tried just about everything else from Founders and had high expectations for this since their other offerings were better than average. Sure enough, that was the case here! No doubt that this was the best Porter that I'd ever had and hands down, this is one of the best dark beers that I ever tasted as well!		This had a near-perfect appearance to it, with a nice, dark body, light brown frothy head, and lacing that looked clung endlessly. The aroma didn't match up to the look but the taste picked up nicely from where the look left off. The body was full and had a great burnt taste to it. However, this wasn't dry and the smoothness of the mouthfeel made the transition to the dark chocolate back easy to take. Everything melded together nicely and this was easier to enjoy than other examples that I've downed more slowly. 		The alcohol was right on target as well, contributing to the warming effect of this without hiding the flavors at all. I was surprised by how good this was and this is good enough to become one of my go-to beers in the winter. Another solid offering by Founders and a must try for anyone looking for an excellent example of this style.";;;;;;;;;;
"Exceptional beer. Light red, copperish hue. Effervescent. Overall tastes like a classy IPA with subtle hints of rye that ground it well. 	I especially enjoyed the aftertaste, which wasn't too fruity like poor IPAs, but had an earthy bitterness from the rye that well balanced the beer. Don't be afraid to try this one, you will be keenly rewarded!";;;;;;;;;;
Surprising is the first word that comes to mind! I could actually taste smoked salmon!!! Very unusual to say the least, but most surprising is that it wasn't overwhelming nor was it disturbing! You could taste the roasted malt in the background, but not too far away, a creamy feel to it and a hint of chocolate ... i never thought i'd give a 4/5 to a beer that has a light smoked salmon taste!!! You simply have to try this one out... very hard to rate!;;;;;;;;;;
"very up and down with this one...pours a strong pale red with a contrasting white head...but it disappears right away...i'm getting no strong smells...malts are there but not like i thought they would be in this malt beverage...but, very delicious...malt smoothness and sweet cherries dominate...if you just were judging by taste, this beer would do alright...you'll see what i'm talking about...		i really wish this brew was more dry and finished with a dry spumante-type finish...but, see what you think...i'd buy a single and stay away from the 4-pack unless you have friends who might enjoy...";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at Bukowski's and at the CBC in kendall sq.		A: Pours a cloudy yellow, amber, golden color with a huge frothy white one finger head. Leaves wonderful lace.	S: Aromas of floral and grapefruit hops dominate the nose. You can smell the bitterness on this guy.	T/M: Grapefruit, pine, lemon, pineapple flavors dance together in the mouth. Ever so slight bready malt flavor that kicks in after it goes down. Big bitter mouthfeel that stings the tongue. Wonderful bitter aftertaste. Very very tasty!!! This one mellows out a little as it warms.	D: Definately a drinkable beer. Tried to get a growler of this at the brewery, but it's considered a ""special beer"" and they only pour house beers. Oh well, but more for everyone else. Get it if you can!";;;;;;;;;;
"A very unassuming ale. Nothing special, but good nonetheless.		A: Nice copper color. Very active carbonation. Dense pillow-like cream head has intense retention and leaves a heavy lace.		S: A nice balance of hops and malt. Very woodsy, with a lot of oak overtones.		T: Well balanced. Hops provide mild bitterness, but not much flavor. The oak theme from the beer's aroma carries through into the taste. Slightly dry finish. Not particularly complex.		M: Medium-light body has the right amount of carbonation.		D: Quite drinkable. I didn't sense anything particularly special in this, but it was still nice.";;;;;;;;;;
Light copper, clear, smells very fruity, much more so than I remember. Taste includes berry with a little bit of tartness, did not get much hoppiness, expected more from the category. Head died quickly, and difficult to judge lacing as I was drinking out of a styrofoam hotel coffee cup (my bad). Overall drinkable, mouthfeel almost a bit sticky or oily, but absolutely worth a try.;;;;;;;;;;
Had this at an Ethiopian restaurant in SF. Small bottle poured into a water glass. Dark brown, no head, no lacing, not too dark either. Smelled of roasty malts, more along the lines of a porter than a stout. Tasty. Not much if any alcohol present. Decent mouthfeel, not too remarkable in any way. Some caramel, some raosty malts, but not overly sweet. All in all it was very drinkable, complemented the meal well, and I had another.;;;;;;;;;;
First off this looks nothing like any ipa I've had before, but what do I know this is the first triple IPA I've ever had. Color is contains dark cherry colors ranging from a purple to maroon. Very limited biscuit color head on this one which is limited to the rim of the glass with carbonation bubbles crawling up the edges. As one sips the glass is coated in what remains as the beer falls from the lip similar to that of a cognac. Smells of cherry, orange and slight alcohol are apparent in the nose reminds me of Gordon DIPA. First thing I taste is grapefruit as well as pine like fruit esters. At 13% you would assume that the alcohol would be overbearing but it is well hidden with zero alcohol burn. This is a very good beer but one for special occasions or a night cap for that really bad day at work. I took a good hour sipping this one and was happy with each sip.;;;;;;;;;;
"I poured into a pint glass to a half inch of mocha head. It is very dark brown in color. The head leaves quickly, but there is some lacing on my glass. It has some coffee and roasted malt smell and maybe some milk chocolate. The taste is so much better than the other day when I was buzzed. The richness of the roasted malts really comes through. It reminds me a lot of Edmund Fitzgerald. It is a very drinkable porter. 		Cheers!";;;;;;;;;;
nice burnt orange with a white head that holds fairly well and leaves very pretty lace. nose and taste consist of piney, citrusy and maybe peachyish hops with a caramelly backbone. decent mouthfeel, a little thicker would be good for me, but there is no doubt this is a first class ipa. tons of competition keep the ratings down, but i could knock these back all night and be in sweet hophead bliss the whole time.;;;;;;;;;;
This beer is very dark with a great tan head. There is lots of head and lots of sticky thick lace. It has a burnt coffee taste with some chocolate tones. It is a very bitter sweet flavored beer. There is a burnt sugar aroma. The body is medium and there is not much for carbonation.;;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at Bukowski's, Cambridge, MA. 		Appearance: 1/2 inch offwhite head that stays for a long time and leaves rings of lacing. Beer pours a very deep amber and leaves clumpy lace on the glass. 		Smell: Bourbon, caramel, maple, maybe some pine lurking around, along with some plum and raisin. Predominantly boozy and rather deep. Very inviting.		Taste: So much going on here. Sweet caramel and toffee, some chocolate, subdued bourbon notes, with a hot alcohol finish. Rather malty at times, but there's definitely some sharp hop influence (piny?). Coffee ice cream, sweet yellow cake, some vanilla, fresh backed cookies, hints of raisin and prune. Tons of creamy, candy/cookie flavors and a lot of depth. Excellent. 		Mouthfeel: Creamy and full-bodied. Kind of sticky and almost chewy. Starts a little watery then thickens way up. Carbonation is decent. Stickiness can almost get to be too much. Hot from the alcohol. 		Drinkability: This is a strong beer in every sense of the word. It hits a bit heavily to have more than one at a time, and I think it's probably a bit too aggressive to be more than a special occasion beer. I won't pass it up if I get the chance to have it again though. 		Delicious beer. Reminded me of some of the deeper, creamier offerings at last night's Night of the Barrels. Lucky find.";;;;;;;;;;
The beer pours a deep ruby color with a 3 finger pink head that falls slowly, leaving a lot of lace behind. The nose is big with sweet raspberry with a wheaty beer backbone behind it. I'm not a big fan of the strong wheaty notes. The flavor is also very wheaty. The raspberry is less strong. The flavor is really lacking any gusto. The feel is thick and full, slightly creamy with a moderate carbonation. I get a blast of heat in my belly from the alcohol. The beer is pretty drinkable. The flavor is just missing something in my book.;;;;;;;;;;
"I really enjoy stuff from Founders and try to sample all the different varieties from these guys. Excited to try Nemesis.		A - Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours molasses black, mostly opaque with brownish-amber highlights and a thin light khaki head.		S - Piny hops, earthy malt, burnt dark sugar to molasses, dark fruit.		T - Coffee, dark malts, floral hops finishing with a hop bitterness mixed with alcoholic aftertaste. 		M - Slightly oily, just under medium bodied, medium carbonation.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle into snifter.		Pours black with a thin light brown head that dissipates into a thin ring around the rim of the glass.		The aroma is very heavily of coffee with light chocolate notes.		The taste is of strong coffee roast with sweet chocolate towards the finish. The ABV is quite well hidden, as I really didn't detect any heat at all.		The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, and not to mention ridiculously smooth.		I really enjoyed this beer as it is one of the smoothest and easiest drinking coffee-forward beers I have tried.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a decent fizzy head of about 1 finger that fades at a med pace with a bit of lacing, over clear reddish slight orange brown color.		Nose is pure smoked malts, a nice smoke though not too overpowering, a bit of a smoked cheese aroma, not much of campfire or anything harsh, just a nice soft smoked gouda like aroma, with a bit of darker wheats and sweet malts behind that, hint of crystal and caramel, and a slight hop character.		Taste starts with more smoke, this time getting a bit more of a smokey smoke, touch of campfire, smoked meats, slight smoked cheese, some sweetness, a bit more darker wheats give it the base with just the slightest hint of fruit, bit of caramel and crystal malts, a slight salty briny taste too. It comes a bit creamy though, with a slight bitterness and just a hint of warming booze. Finishes a bit drier, smoke lingering smoked cheese, a bit more bitterness with a touch of hops and some of the salty smoked malts.		Mouth is medium to slightly bigger bodied, a bit creamy, with decent carbonation and hint of warming booze.		Overall pretty good, drinkable, much more smooth and mild than the Urbock or Marzen I think. Drinkable and nice smoke qualities.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to ManekiNeko for a couple of bottles.	Pours an orange/amber hue with a white head and splotchy lace.	Aroma of caramel, bubblegum, orange citrus and some piney resins.	Flavor starts with chewy caramel and mvoes to a really resiny hop note and a quikc burst of citrus. Finishes with a strange and powerful burst of depp pine bittering.	Mouthfeel is medium-boided with some lifht sweetness. This is followed by varying degress of bittering ranging from citrus to heavy, gooey resins. Highly hopped.	Drinkability is good. Nice combination fo sweet and bittering. Powerful resined note at the end is a bit over the top but doesn't detract too much.";;;;;;;;;;
"A- Pours a very dark brown color with a bit of red head lights when held to a light. A tan colored head with good retention and leaves good lacing. 		S- Pretty interesting roasted malts, chocolate and tropical hops. 		T- Hops are citrusy with some pineapple and a bit of pine. The malts add great balance, with smokiness, caramel and sugar. 		M- Lighter side of being full in body and low carboantion. Very creamy and smooth.		D- Very solid I like the complexity here. I like this one better than last years since this one is not nearly as hot.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to the most standup BA I know, Kevin (kzoobrew) for this great beer. Cheers friend! Can't wait to try it.		Appearance - Pours into my Bell's Tulip with an impressive dark color. I really didn't believe how black this was until I held it up to the light and nothing came through, even around the edges. About a finger of tan/mocha colored head is achieved with a rather vigorous pour that dissipates at a moderate pace, but leaves nice, light lacing on the glass.		Smell - Caramel, oranges, molasses, dark fruits such as plums and raisins, burnt brown sugar, roasted malts, just a hint of chocolate, and slight hops.		Taste - Honestly, similar to the nose. It begins with a rather sweet flavor of caramel, brown sugar, and the dark fruits as mentioned in the nose. There is a nice citrus bitterness from grapefruit and orange, more prevalent than the nose would have indicated that nicely accentuates the sweetness of the beer. At the tail end of the taste, there is coffee, a slight cocoa bitterness, and just a tad of vanilla. As the beer warms, there is a nice estrangement of earthiness that makes itself prevalent. A damn tasty beer, though not as ""barleywine"" as I would have expected.		Mouthfeel - One of the highlights of the beer in my opinion. The first sip made it known to me this beer was to be taken seriously. Very smooth, creamy, medium to almost heavy Mouthfeel. Lower carbonation, and finishes just a hint dry/bitter.		Drinkability - I really do mean it when I say the alcohol is masked extremely well here. I detect literally no alcohol in the initial taste (it is there slightly) and again, very little alcohol warming. This I find quite impressive seeing as this is a 12% beer and in addition is relatively ""fresh"" in regards to when it was released. Kevin was right about drinking it now - I get to taste the nice hoppy bitterness intertwined with the prevalent yet not overpowering sweetness associated with a barleywine. A very good beer and am extremely glad I was able to try it.";;;;;;;;;;
This one pours a dark brown color with a very small head that doesn't last and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma had an aroma of a cheap whiskey more than bourbon along with hints of roasted malts. The flavor had a definate bourbon overtone but is backed by a malty porter. Some wood character and some slight sourness. This could use a little more body, but overall, it's pretty tasty. The drinkability is pretty good.;;;;;;;;;;
"Good old Founders. They seem to always to live up to their expectations for me. In this case, I'm trying out their Double Trouble DIPA. Haven't heard much about this one, but I love the bottle art - an optical illusion of sorts, with two faces stacked on top of each other. That's a good start in my mind.		A: Shiny golden body; a bit murkier than I expected. Looks heavy for a DIPA. I like that. And, like most Founders I've tried, there's a relatively thin head. Would have liked more in that regard, but it might turn out to help the feel.		S: Intense, piney hops. Hardly a single note gets past the spicy intensity of the bitterness. What I mainly take from the nose is a light feeling of wholesome freshness from the hops.		T: A nice, farm-style grouping of hops dominate the palate, as well. Within that, there's the light sweetness of cherry/strawberry preserves. Grassy/earthy finish. The hops don't stick with you for long afterward, making room for more blends to emerge from the body: pine and herb, pear and apricot, subtle booze. This, I feel, is the defining distinction with this brew: there isn't that lingering taste of hops that overwhelms the palate, distorting the flavor of the subsequent second, third, fourth, etc. drinks. This is the problem with some other extra-hoppy PA's, and Founders handled it perfectly.		M: There is a somewhat reduced carbonation. In my opinion, it gives it a more conditioned/aged feel. Founders takes the risk of trying to make this beer seem more mature, and it works in their favor. Impressive.		O: This is a wonderful example of the IPA/DIPA style, and Founders really shows mature taste and discretion in brewing it in their own way. Instead of just showcasing a super hoppy creation, they throw down the gauntlet for Pale Ale FLAVOR. Genuine and memorable - this beer is damn good.";;;;;;;;;;
"A- Black color with some activity, a thin tan head with small bubbles.		S- Nice coffee smell with a hint of chocolate.		T- Bitter sweet chocolate flavor but very smooth. It's a very nice flavor of the bitter sweet in a great balance. There is also a dryness in there as well.		M- Very creamy feel, nice.		D- A nice sipper and very enjoyable, as drinkable when it warms up as it was cold.";;;;;;;;;;
"Into a pint glass, pours a dark woody brown bordering on copper, a nice inch thick off-white head shrinking to a thickish film, with some pretty nice lacing. The aroma is meaty, mostly bacon, burnt and smoky oak... its right on for the style but still a bit shocking, in that its almost not like beer. In fact, it reminds me a bit of smoking cigars, for some reason.		The taste I can enjoy more, and regains some beery qualities. Starts off quite smoky and lots of woodiness, turns more malty with toffee and they malty base is most evident. And then it turns right back to the smoke, a bit drawn out finish that ends dry and again reminds me of smoking a fine cigar.		The mouths is around medium, decent carbonation, drying toward the end, pretty decent. What I really needed while drinking this is a bid, meaty heap of a sandwich. That would've been quality. But alone, it still stands tall.		The rauchbier is the style that could easily be horrible if ill-tuned, but this one is right on the money.";;;;;;;;;;
"Not surprisingly, I always consider Czech Pils to be one of the best. I suppose the name had to come from somewhere!		The initial appearance was a golden color with a nice healthy white head,which slowly dissolved.		The smell quite crisp, almost like Budvar, but not as malty.		It had an initial good blend of tastes. Very refreshing and not a pils which is heavy as Budvar. Could sense a bit of malt, but again, no strong aftertaste. A good solid taste all around.		It had a good feel, very smooth not as thick nor as watery. Again, a pretty light pils, and not as heavy as Budvar.		Very drinkable, if you think Budvar is too heavy for a pils, this is a good compromise. Pretty impressed.";;;;;;;;;;
Thin head just a few bubbles after the pour around the edges of the glass. Dark brown in color. Barley wine alcohol, sweet, smokey, fennel, chocolate aromas. Really nice flavors, some interesting mixtures of things going on in this beer. Mouthfeel is thin but flavorful enough to balance out the whole thing. It's also got a dry finish. Found this beer to be really freaking good, would have loved to try the Bourbon one but they had sold out by the time I got there.;;;;;;;;;;
"A-Deep brown w/rusty violet tint on edges where light comes through. Very light head that quickly disappears.		S-Sweet smoked meats, sweet roast malt.		T-Smoked meat, salt and hint of minerals, hints of cocoa, toasted malts. I can't make out a lick of hops, but the sensation I have on the finish tells me there are some, even though it's washed out by the smokiness. To be honest, I wasn't really in the mood for this kind of flavor when I popped it open, and the first sip made me want to retch and build a campfire. It grew on me very quickly, and I'll buy this again, but not until I go camping. 		M-Slightly light on the body w/moderate carbonation. 		D-Not bad at first, and very good once it gets warm.";;;;;;;;;;
16.9 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear copper color with a half inch off-white head that went away quickly. However, there's a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is toffee, caramel, raisins and some butterscotch. It's a mostly sweet malty aroma. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's the addition of some toasted malt and figs. Mouthfeel/body is medium with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it certainly goes down easy enough. I think it's a decent brew, it's definitely worth a try.;;;;;;;;;;
"On tap 9/15/04 at Cedar Brewing Co.		Very Dark brown to black with a low light brown head. Strong roasty espresso aroma and flavor. Fairly light bodied for the style but has a nice roasty dry finish.		One of Cedar's better brews and in my Top 3 there.		Per CB website: Malted barley and a blend of roasted barley, chocolate and black patent malts. This black colored beer is creamy and rich. Suprisingly smooth with a little bite.		4.2% ABW / 5.25% ABV";;;;;;;;;;
"Color: pours brown. sits dark ruby		Smell: sweet malt aroma with oak and bourbon. light alcohol and hint of sweet bread and vanilla		Taste: sweet, bready malt flavors with woody and bourbon tones. finishes sweet with some whiskey and oak flavor and hints of dark fruit, cocoa, vanilla and warming alcohol		Mouthfeel: heavy-med body. smooth with low carbonation		Notes: delicious fuckin beer! i wait all year for this and i made sure we stocked up big time at the store. one of my favorite beers and probly my favorite seasonal ANYONE puts out! decided to give it a 5 cause i cant imagine a scotch ale getting any better. i can always go back anyway";;;;;;;;;;
"I gave my wife a 'blind' taste from my glass... she said ""is this from Schlenkerla?"". Supposedly not a Rauchbier, but it certainly has a smokey element. Perhaps even more than Spezial's house lager? (though the bottle was obtained in Michigan, so who know's how long it has 'conditioned').		A: Clear, golden yellow; white head, hardly any retention, but it initially leaves some lace.		S: Fresh, floral hops (a bit of a soapy aroma); a slight hint of smoke; a little toffee & bread in the background.		T: Malty bread & toffee up front, moderate floral hop flavour, mild smoke (mostly in the aftertaste). Excellent bitter-sweet balance, with the sweetness fading to a crisp finish. This gets bonus points for its flavour-to-weight ratio!		M: Surprisingly heavy for a 4.3% brew; more body than a lot of stronger lagers. Almost chewy, yet creamy. It's not very dry (seems to be a pleasant amount of residual sugar), but has a crisp finish. Amazing.		D: Plenty of flavour for a 'light' brew. I could certainly session this!		Thanks for picking this up Eric (Frozensoul), I thoroughly enjoyed it!";;;;;;;;;;
Golden yellow color with a thin lace around the glass head. Smells grainy with a nice bit of spicy hops, very clean. Light bodied with a meduim amount of carbonation. Taste is spicy hops, I think I taste some Saaz hops. Grassy grains and some light malt. Very drinkable and thirst quinching. Not bad at all. I have had better pilsners, but this one was worth the try.;;;;;;;;;;
"One of two bottles most generously received from cmaruschak recently.		Inky, opaque darkness. ""Ewww...that looks like motor oil!"" proclaims the wife. Dark tan head rises from nothing to a finger-thin level, then slowly fades. Some lacing of the glass with sticky globules.		Good golly does this smell wonderful! My nose was assualted by a myriad of aromas: freshly ground coffee beans, dark chocolate, initially subdued notes of bourbon and a toffee/char scent. As it warmed, the bourbony notes took center stage.		Up front, the flavors are dominated by a sweet choco-coffee combination. The bourbony notes flare up, especially as it warms, mixing with the chocolate. Near the end, some bitterness creeps in, along with some vanilla extract and a hint of ABV. I should note that I still am not a huge fan of bourbon-aged beers, but this was tame enough in the bourbon department to add a very flavorful and well-balanced component to an already fantastic beer.		Not a full-bodied or thick as the regular breakfast stout. Still, I had no problems finishing this one. A close 2nd behind the regular Breakfast Stout in my book.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a copper dark brown clear color, with a quick tan head. Smells like mesquite chips. This is a great german beer that would go well with BBQ ribs or smoked turkey legs. Good smoked meaty smell. If you don't like the smell, go no further. I on the other hand love a good smoked meat, the taste of this beer did not let me down. Sweet, mesquite wood flavor. Slightly coffee aftertaste. Somewhat watery in texture, I thought it would be more like a stout. Makes me think of camping or burning leaves. Wouldn't just drink this beer alone. This is definetly a food beer. I hope this one or one similar is at the next german food tasting that I attend.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a Spaten tumbler. Bright, semi-cloudy orange color. Small one and a half finger, bright white colored head. Frothy and sticky in appearance. Lace looks as if it wants to play for a while. 		Smell is bright, orange blossom, citrus scent. A hint of sweet bread and just the slightest alcohol. 		The taste is bitter citrus hop, maybe a yellow grapefruit mixed with the sweetness of a pineapple. The bitter is pretty intense. As this warms the bitter does mellow and the sweetness takes over. Just a hint of boozyness warming in the throat. Very nice!!		Mouth is bright and zesty. Well carbonated and full to the end. 		Overall I really enjoyed this DIPA from Founders. Thanks to xanok for the extra. Highly recommended!!";;;;;;;;;;
"another courtesy of Viggo. thanks eric!		500ml bottle. sampled jan 31/2011.		pours a hazy orange with a thick cap of white head. the head drops slowly and leaves a bit of spotty lace.		aroma is good. smokey! rich deep meaty smoke, with a nice weizen spice hiding behind it. light caramel. lightly earthy. whole wheat bread. bit of biscuit and grain.		taste is great. nice and smokey, but it seems slightly more restrained, or perhaps integrated, than in the aroma. light caramel. lovely weizen spice. whole wheat bread. bit of caraway rye too. touch of biscuit and grain. hint of alcohol. nice earthy character.		mouthfeel is good. just under medium body. medium carbonation level.		drinkability is great. excellent integration between the smoke and the weizen. these guys do good smoked beer. already looking forward to the urbock that's on deck!";;;;;;;;;;
A very black color pour with a thin, creamy, dark brown head that diminishes to a nice thin ring,and leaves some good lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is of dark roasted malt, light coffee, faint toffee, and sweet dark fruitiness.Flavor is very roasty malt driven, coffee,bitter chocolate notes some wood or maybe grain,very balanced. Medium-bodied light carbonation, slick mouthfeel with a dry, bitter-roasted finish that features just a touch of alcohol. As always Founders makes it Yummy !;;;;;;;;;;
"served on-tap @ Flying Saucer, Kansas City, MO, into a pint glass		I reviewed this beer in the bottle a couple of years ago. I hated it, and I looove the Porter style. I always suspected, though, that I got an old six-pack. Tonight, I finally decided to try it again. 		Pours a color that is pretty much black. It is effectively black. Which is nice. There's nearly 1.75 fingers of khaki head. It laces like you'd think a head of that size would: like a dream.		The aroma is a very, very solid melange of baker's chocolate, heavy roasted malts, and bitter hops. There isn't really anything beyond those three elements. It's a lot of bitter smells, but that's what I want in a porter.		Oh, man. This tastes aweeesome. It's so, so roasty. Roast roast roast. There's lots of dark, bitter chocolate flavor here too. But the roast takes over. But, and this is key, there's a whole lot of hop flavor here too. It's so bitter with green hop flavor that it starts to duel with the roast about which element of bitterness is going to win over the palate. That sounds bad, doesn't it? It sounds like a beer that is confused. Let me assure you that it totally works. These contrasting bitternesses represent what the porter style can do better than any other style. This is so good. 		Mouthfeel is also good. It's got a pretty innocuous body; you don't really notice it ever. The carbonation level is soft but not without power behind its bubbles. 		When I first got into beer, Boulevard's Bully! Porter was my favorite beer. It was an incredible porter with contrasting bitternesses -- the roast bitterness complimented and contrasted with the hop bitterness. Bully! Porter has in recent years received a recipe change. It's far less hoppy for some reason. Well, Founders Porter picks up the slack on the hoppy + roasty porter style. I take back everything I've ever said about this beer. It is excellent.";;;;;;;;;;
"Really excited to try this maple bourbon barrel aged wheat wine. Bottled 2/3/10. Pours into my glass a brilliant red orange with some hazy particulate like a fall sunset. Small white bubbles on top. Aromas feature complex layers of crisp sweet wheat, caramel and an amazing mix of bourbon, vanilla, wood and rich maple syrup. A touch of honey as well.		First sip brings crisp, dense sweet malts drenched in a wash of caramel and bourbon. Big vanilla flavors and a great kick of maple syrup. Honey and wood tones along with a kick of alcohol heat on the way down. Finishes with maple and lingering bourbon. Simply wonderful.		Mouthfeel is hefty and malty with a good mellow carbonation. A tad sweet with big viscosity. This one is a sipper and every sip is a smile. Bold, complex and flavorful, the maple really makes it. Glad I was able to try this one and look forward to more in the Nemesis series!!";;;;;;;;;;
"Had to edit this one: Big thanks to madtowndmb1 for helping me acquire this beer, much appreciated man, thanks a million!		Pours black, with an inviting coffee colored topper of foam, about a half an inch high, which drops pretty quickly, leaving a few bubbles here and there.		Vanilla, chocolate, and whisky are prominent in the nose, along with an underlying roasted quality. If the taste can back up the aroma, this should be good.		Wow! So much going on, it's a little overwhelming. Roasted grains, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, a rounded bourbon whisky flavor. I get some brown sugar in there as well. Coffee bitterness comes on strong at the end, and more so as it warms. Pleased to note that I'm not really noticing any apparent alcohol. Also, as I'm sure others have previously noted, my bottle ('09) reads ABV of 11.2%, while BA has it listed above at 10%. 		Mouthfeel is full as full can be! Silky smooth, bitingly bitter, and definitely decadent. 		I'm not a big fan of hype. I've sought out beer after beer, only to be let down and depressed. This is not the case here. This one is worth it. I'm about 5 ounces in, and I've got a nice warming feeling going on. I can't wait to try one of these in a year or two, although I seriously doubt that I will be able to wait that long. Cheers!";;;;;;;;;;
"9.8% ABV, $2.60 for a 12oz bottle at Jack's, although I bought a 4 pack for $9.99. Cool label looks like Tartakovsky drew Qui Gon Jin. Pours out to a cloudy reddish-amber, forming a small light yellow head despite a very vigorous pour. Small, very fine yeast layer in the bottle. Average retention and minimal lacing. Carbonation is quite mild. The aroma is intense with a ton of brown bananas, candi sugar, sweet caramel...this is bananas foster in a bottle. Wonderful, fresh nose akin to Final Absolution. Medium-dense lightly syrupy body. The taste begins with a slamdunk of phenols, a ton of bananas with a nice roasty grain bitterness (sorta like that Schwarz-Weizen I had a few days ago, but much better), orange juice, and some candi-sugar sweetness. Bitterness is well-balanced for the style and adds a nice hoppy astringency to the finish which balances with the malty sweetness. Cleanly fermented.		Another amazing brew from Founder's...IMO, the premiere brewery in Michigan. Check it out. This one should age very nicely. Recommended!";;;;;;;;;;
"Had ""Icky"" (as the locals call it) ontap at a real nice pizza place in Sparks. One of the best AIPA's ive had in a good long while. It's a bit sweeter than some of the IPA's im used to in Oregon. Got a lot more florals and herbal flavors from it, as opposed to the citrus and pine i'm accustomed to. 		Pour was a amber copper, with a thin sticky head. The lacing grabbed the glass wherever and whenever it could to create resinous art down the side of my glass. 		Juicy sweetness, with enough bitterness to add complexity. Like I said afore, this was one of my favorite ipa's in a very long time, and more complex and interesting than say, a Stone IPA, though not as 'big'.";;;;;;;;;;
"Served into a Bruery tulip glass at about 45 degrees.		Pours a viscous black with a creamy tan froth and decent lacing that really doesn't stick to the glass. Decent head retention. Aromas of roasted coffee, chocolate, chicory, oatmeal, subtle citrus hops, roasted barley, soft molasses, easy mocha, smoke, light charcoal, & light peppercorn. Creamy, but dry texture and burnt flavors of roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate and chicory lead to a long finish. The 8.3% abv & hop presence is very well hidden, but definitely present. Overall a great coffee stout that is definitely worth the hype.	Thanks kmurray8621 for the great trade! Cheers!";;;;;;;;;;
"fairly dark brown with ruby edges while holding to the light. Small tan head that goes away quickly.	sweet malts, boozy, well ripened fruits. Dates or figs come to mind. Really sensing an almost bourbon nose	bourbon notes dominate the palate. Big and boozy..wooden, earthy. Sweet caramel and bing cherries...well may not be bing.	Nice big mouthfell.";;;;;;;;;;
"According to wikipedia, this must be an IPA that ""conducts specialized operations such as reconnaissance, unconventional warfare, and counter-terrorism actions."" The Green Berets of beers, if you will.		Anyway, it's a copper, slightly hazy IPA with a slim ring of white head. Smell is one dimensional hops. Taste is caramel malts and lingering hops. Mouthfeel is decent, and drinkability is great. This is a very sessionable IPA, considering the ABV.";;;;;;;;;;
"Re-review:		I quickly figured out my first bottle of Centennial was on the old side and got one that was a lot fresher this time around. What a difference that made! Great IPA. Dark orange, cloudy, 1/2 inch of off white head that falls quickly. A small white band remains on top, with patchy lacing on the sides of the glass.		Fruity, citrusy aroma with lots of grapefruit; earthy and lightly floral with a touch of caramel malt underneath it all. Excellent flavor matches the nose, with citrusy, grapefruity, pineapple hops and a nice malt backbone. Good bitterness that lingers pleasantly in the finish. Much better and subtler than the older bottle, the nuances of the hops are all there in spades. Very drinkable. 		Original review:		Dark gold beer with a smallish head; decent lacing and retention. Mildly hoppy aroma. Nicely hopped bitter taste..maybe a bit one dimensional for my liking. More bitter than anything else; the citrus and floral notes I like in IPA's were a bit lacking here. The beer does open up after time to reveal soft malty notes and the booze. Good mouthfeel, medium long finish, moderate carbonation.		I guess I was a little disappointed by this one. I really enjoy Founders beers but I wanted a little more subtlety and nuance here. Not bad by any means but could have been better.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a deep dark brown with a hint of lacing - no head to speak of.		Oak is very prominent in the nose - has the typical earthy oak aroma. Also hints of boozy sweet caramel and a touch of vanilla.		Wow. Lots of bourbon. Tastes a lot like you'd expect from the smell. Very smooth & malty with some oak notes and a lot of boozy caramel sweetness. Not much fruit or vanilla flavor.		Mouthfeel is perfect - medium body, plenty thick, nicely carbonated. 		I had no problem polishing off a bottle - at this abv it's probably best to leave it at one 'though.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Pours between an amber and a brown with an orange hue. Little to no head at all.		S - Very, very floral. True to the name, lots of heather as well as lavender and other spices and herbs.		T - Nothing like I've ever had before. Earthy floral galore with bits of spices the whole way, namely a feel of cinnamon. A slight mint leaf hint somewhere around the middle. Bits of sweet tea with honey. It's more difficult than usual to tell what you're smelling and what you're tasting as you bring the glass away from your mouth.		M - Carbonation and sweetness from the heather make a very interesting and satisfying feel. Medium bodied with a bit of a dry finish.		D - Very enjoyable and one I always look forward to. Love seeing a brewery think outside of the box when it comes to brewing a ""summer"" beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appears almost black, unless you put the glass in front of a light bulb, when you'll see that really it's a dark ruby red. This is my favorite color in a beer. I don't know why it appeals to me so much.		The light tan head is rather small, but releases an absolute malty aroma explosion. This is the way a bock SHOULD smell! No hops, all malt, no apologies. Yeah! If you don't know what malt in a beer smells like, than go sniff out an Asam Bock. You'll be confused no longer.		Of course the taste is all malt as well, as one should demand in a bock. However, there's a decent amount of hop bitterness to keep it from being too sweet. The complexity tells me there might be a hint of black or roasted barley in there, but most likely it's just due to an insane amount of quality German Munich malt. There's a silky smoothness in the mouthfeel that perfectly complements all that malt goodness. Oh man, I really enjoy this beer. Strangely, there's almost no aftertaste on the palate. As soon as you swallow there's nothing there lingering. But that's OK, it just means you'll have to take another sip ASAP!		I could find nothing wrong with this beer, only that I don't have another one to follow it up with! It's aroma and flavor are perfect opposites to that of the IPAs I've been drinking for way too long. This beer convinces me it's time for a change to German bocks!";;;;;;;;;;
Pours light orange into my nonic with a creamy white head. Light hops, citrus, floral on the nose. Taste is fresh, citrus/hops, very crisp. Light on mouthfeel, floral/citrus on the palate with a smooth/clean finish. The 7.20 ABV is well-hidden I could could easily drink several more pints. Will revisit very soon.;;;;;;;;;;
"At Macs in Charlotte. Golden/orange pour, maybe a finer of off white head. Just barely laces the glass.		Aroma has a surprising amount of barrel prescence. Vanilla and oak intertwine with zest and herbal pine.		Taste they intertwine even more, but even better. Very interesting how the vanilla and oak merge with the piney hops, orange and lemon citrus. Very unique.		Medium bodied, could be a little lighter and a little less sticky. Still good. There is a definete warmth to it, aided by the barrel charcteristics. Has a creaminess to it that makes it very drinkable however.		Not bad, get one if you see it.";;;;;;;;;;
Sampled at CBC. A clear burnt sienna color when poured. Not much head, but subtle lacing left in the glass while drinking. Smell was reminiscent of sweet pumpkins. Taste was exactly of pumpkins, with a light hand with the spices. It was a nice change to have smooth pumpkin flavor, with not a heavy hand with the spices. A very nice version that is easy to drink as well.;;;;;;;;;;
"Chilled bottle into a glass. Received as an extra from semibaked. Thanks! 		A: Pours a cloudy orange / copper color with a thin white head that fades quickly. Leaves some trace lacing down the glass. Has slow carbonation up the center. This isn't the best-looking IPA I've ever seen; I prefer clearer-looking ones. Thankfully, appearance is now a small weighting in the overall score. 		S: Citrus, namely orange, grapefruit, and pineapple. A little honey is detected also. Some floral scents too. When it's cold, the pineapple dominates, and I absolutely love it. I go coo-coo for tropical aromas, and this nails it. As it warms, the orange takes over, so it's less exciting, but hardly bad. 		T: The initial taste is floral, which imparts a mild bitterness. Pineapple is quite strong (again, especially when cold), and I pick up orange, grapefruit, and lemon. The beer becomes progressively grassier as it warms, and it manifests more bitterness in the finish. But it's never enough to be truly off-putting. At best, I can tell this wasn't made on the West Coast. At worst, it's really, really enjoyable. To be perfectly honest, I enjoyed this more than this year's HopSlam. 		M: Medium bodied, with low-to-medium carbonation. Has a decent warmth to it, but no burn. A fairly dry, if slightly bitter, finish. 		D: Pretty good. I normally enjoy HopSlam more than Double Trouble, but in a stunning upset, the excellence rankings have reversed this year. Wish I hadn't missed out on this when it was coming out in large quantities. I need more.";;;;;;;;;;
If you are a pale ale fan, you can't do any better than this quality brew.  Fresh out of the tap yields an extra citrus taste element not noticable in the bottle.  Pike has done a superb job of making the pale with just the right amount of bitterness without a strong aftertaste.  So smooth you'll drain the glass before you thought you could.;;;;;;;;;;
Poured a nice billowing white head stickiness down the glass. Lots of carbonation been sitting in the fridge for months. Great taste very crisp. Malts are very well balanced. Last sip made me really feel the alcohol. Not a bad lager!! I will stick with there McCarthy Red for now!! Oktoberfest is coming!!;;;;;;;;;;
"All I can say is ""wow!""		A= Pours a hazy orange hue		S=Hoppy, piney,citrus aroma		T=This is the ultimate American Pale Ale. Great balance,totally fits the bill for the style. I could drink this all friggin night! This should be the standard for APA's!!		M- Creamy,spicy,hoppy...great mouthfeel		D- WOW. Really glad that I found this. 		Happy New Year!!!";;;;;;;;;;
"The Pike Pub has made a decent name for itself in the Pacific Northwest with a nice array of relatively hoppy ales including their IPA, Kilt Lifter and now Naughty Nellie's Ale. Nellie's is the least hoppy of the three, but that would make it a litlte more drinkable for the average uninitiated hophead. 		Pours a very light golden color with a nice amount of carbination. A fairly sized, white foamy head forms on the pours which rather quickly gives way to little more than a thin surface coating. Lacing is minimal but the collar is quite substantial.		The malty characteristics of this beer overpower the hoppy characteristics, but that blend tends to give this brew a little more earthy complexure plus a sincere fruity kick overall.		Tastewise, the hops come through a little more in flavor than in aroma, but again the malt build up is the prevailing factor here. Although the hops on this one are used to offset an overpowering malt factor, and its not considered or intended to be a hoppy ale, the hop characters are quite prevelant.		Overall this is a rather enjoyable brew and very drinkable, but it does pale in comparsion to the Kilt Lifter Scotch Ale and their flagship Pike IPA. Give it a try if you get the chance, but if you know you like hops, stick to their more formidable brews.		[ STATS:&gt;&gt; SERVING: 12oz bottle / ABV: 4.7% / PRICE: $1.39 USD ]";;;;;;;;;;
"I had this on tap at a little neighborhood pub in the shadow of the Gilde Brewery in Hannover, Germany.		A - Presentation of the beer in Germany takes on a new meaning and is part of the overall experience of the beer. Poured into a 0.3L shaped, stemmed and properly logo'ed Gilde glass in 4 stages by the bartender to allow for the impressive foam head to die down each time until she can finally fill the glass up to plimsoll line and still leaving a thick, whipped cream like and shape holding 3 finger cap of foam that extends beyond the top of the glass. A crystal clear, deep golden body sits beneath with streams of carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Add to the presentation the finishing touches of the Gilde logo'ed coaster and doily around the stem of the glass and the appearance is just amazing.		S - Bitter aroma up front of noble hops with the clean and a bit spicy character coming through nicely. Slightly buttery aroma that smoothes things out and blends with a low level sweetness and a host of grainy and bready/biscuity malts at the base. This is very fresh for sure probably hasn't been away from the brewery for more than a few days at most.		T - Pretty much spot on with the aroma. This is as a Pils should be. Grainy and bready at the base, lightly sweet up front and fading easily to a assertive and crisp, clean hop bitterness. Very clean flavors.		M - Medium bodied with a soft feeling medium carbonation level. The flavors transition smoothly from soft sweet grains to a drying bitter hoppiness thru to the finish.		O - Well, I really have a soft spot for this beer. This was the first beer I had in Germany on my first trip there over a decade ago. This is definitely a solid Pils. Even after many trips over the years and lots of palette development over that time, this one really holds up for me. It's what I look for when I'm there and never disappointed, unlike many of the the other pils I've had in Germany.";;;;;;;;;;
"750 mL bottle of the 2011 vintage. A huge thank you to inlimbo77 for providing me with this one!		Pours a deep, blood red with about an inch or so of bubbly, purple head. The body looks nearly black in the glass, but retains an ominous red glow when held to the light. It looks absolutely stunning. Smells, as one might suspect, of raspberries; crisp, refreshing raspberries - without the artificial sugar scent - dominate the nose, but some yeasty, belgian-like scents escape the depths and are vaguely noticeable. Taste is very similar, being primarily of fresh raspberries, so much that it reminds me of homemade raspberry jam. It is slightly sugary in the mouth, but the carbonation helps it from being overly-so; it also seems to bring out the tiny bit of belgian pale character that lies beneath the surface, as some yeasty notes can be found rather readily after the raspberry punch subsides. A small amount of warming alcohol lives at the end. The carbonation is great, and helps the beer finish slightly dry instead of sticky/sugary. Overall, this is the best fruit beer I have ever had, and I feel fortunate to have been able to try it.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle poured into a shaped pint glass.		This is wrong on so many levels. To be fair, Founders Cerise should be reviewed for Wine Cooler Advocate; however here we are. It pours a pale red (I can't write ""pi**"") with some fizz on top, but not anything I'd call a head. 		The smell, taste, and after-taste (!) are like cheap cherry wine. The feel is sparkly and refreshing. There is no denying that it's drinkable, it just should not be allowed to call itself ""ale.""		I can imagine a group of 21 year olds drinking Founders Cerise at a pool party, along with umbrella drinks; however, after finishing one today, I feel like I need to follow it with a beer (and possibly a shot of testosterone).";;;;;;;;;;
This is a great brew for the fall/winter. Very dark with a little brown head. Smells like over cooked coffee. Tastes very coffee with subtle chocolate undertones. Feels very smooth, not as viscous as I anticipated. Great for sessions or if you're just trying to warm up on a cold day.;;;;;;;;;;
"sampled through trade with northertimber.	poured red copperish color with orange with sunset colored edges. tan/half finger head.	this has nice has a nice hoppy smell with hints of nice crisp fruit. 	the flavor follows the smell. great taste. there almost seems like there are hints of apples and strawberries.	carbonation is a bit high, but the hoppiness balances out well. this would be great sessional beer. many thanks norhtertimber";;;;;;;;;;
"I really enjoyed BBC's Dark Star Porter so I'm expecting good things from this pale ale. Big burst of pent-up carbonation on crown cracking. Murky tawny with a huge, stiff, light toffee colored head that is cratering on its superior surface and looks like it'll never deflate. It's an impressive lacer as well; mostly small chunklets in abstract patterns, no real rings or sheets.		Beautifully hoppy nose that isn't quite IPA-like, but is close. The hops smell more like orange and lemon than grapefruit. After drinking, I continue to be impressed. The beer is more grapefruity on the palate than it was in the nose, indicative of at least one of the 4-Cs. There's a decent amount of sweet pale malt on hand in addition to the bitter citrus fruit. Bottom line: well-balanced with a solid nod in the direction of the hops. 		The body/mouthfeel leans toward full for the style and the generous amount of carbonation, in addition to delivering a majestic head, gives the beer a lively mouthfeel that doesn't cross the line into fizziness.		Bluegrass American Pale Ale (cue the Star Spangled Banner) is at least as good as Dark Star Porter and is a very good APA. It has no weaknesses to speak of and the bottom of my pint glass was visible shockingly quickly. A big Thank You to SheepNutz for the bottle.";;;;;;;;;;
"I kind of bought this bottle as a joke, as part of a mix-a-six at a local spirit shop. Wasn't expecting it to be a halfway decent beer, honestly.		A - A crystal clear copper brew that produces a neat little bubbly head.		S - Sweet and tangy. There's just the slightest hint of hops in the background. However, I have a hard time really picking out the complete aroma because it's just not that aromatic. Fairly boring smell. I doubt there's any corn in there, but I am picking up just a bit of that in aroma, too.		T - Sweet, sweet, sweet. Caramel and just a bit of apple zing to it. Based on the nose I expected a bit of light bitterness to it; however I wasn't really able to pull any bitter notes out of it.		M - Richly carbonated. Finishes fairly dry.		D - It's pretty light and refreshing, almost Kolsch-esque (in fact this beer's character reminds me more of a Kolsch than a pale ale). Coupled with the low ABV I could see this as a session beer, splitting a pitcher or two with some buddies.		Pleasantly surprised with this brew, really. Not bad.";;;;;;;;;;
Dark chestnut color, almost mohogany. Small, thin white head, not much retention or lace. Darker, malt almost a roasty aroma. Floral hop aroma. Good slightly caramel biscuit malt, followed by a fair amount of floral hop bitterness. Finishes slightly dry. Lighter body, low carbonation. This is another great session beer brom Broad Ripple.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Darkness snifter.		A- Pours a  finger head dissipates quickly, carbonation streaming off the bottom of the glass, dark muddy brown color, really cloudy, splotchy lacing, nice bubbly lacing around the glass.	S- Big bourbon aroma, dark fruits, vanilla, alcohol is present, malt, some spice.	T- Bourbon is definitely present, bitter sweet, vanilla, oak presence, caramel, brown sugar, some spice, sweet malt. 	M- Big mouth feel, crisp finish, nice burn from the alcohol, well carbonated. 	O- This is a big beer, really enjoyed the big bourbon flavors, not over powering but really balanced, really impressed.";;;;;;;;;;
"This is great beer!	Stonecrusher stopped by and mentioned that the case I had was not dated and ran the risk of being old, I trust the big lug so we cracked one in the store to test it.		Poured a nice light gold with a thin head, that had me a little worried at first because it died so fast.		The smell was slightly smoky, like a nice western highland scotch, wicked with some hops and a good green leaf hint. Had a hint of rye bread in the nose.		The taste is smooth with a smoky/hickory pepper that would pair well most cheese, and good marbled beefcuts. It finishes with a subtle malt/hop body thats like a sour dough bread.		Best beer I have had in a while. I quote crusher ""this beer rocks""";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a pils glss. Just a wonderful offering from Founders! Pours black, with a 1/4"" brown head that every world class stout has. Smell was of dark, burnt roasted malt and cocoa...followed by the dark roasted coffee. Taste followed the smell in order of the flavors that hit your tastebuds. Mouthfeel was would you would expect of a stout of this caliber....silky....no...velvetty. Fantastic beer!";;;;;;;;;;
"A-a clear copper orange with a thin layer of white head		S-pumpkin, spices, and medium amount of malt		T-very balanced, you can actually taste the pumpkin, light amount of spices and malt, not too sweet		M-light to medium body, moderate carbonation, smooth		Overall this is one of the better pumpkin beers out there, low in alcohol which is a nice change compared to many pumpkin beers that pack in the alcohol and you almost can't taste the pumpkin";;;;;;;;;;
The cherry flavor is well managed. Too often in cherry-flavored beers you get something more like a Jolly Rancher or cough drop, but here the cherry is very mild, almost more of a background flavor. Not too sweet, with a some tartness to balance. Finish was a little dry, with cherry pit bitterness.;;;;;;;;;;
"A: A fairly transparent, but vibrant copper, and off-white head, left decent lacing.		S: Strong citrus hop notes, grapefruit, and a faint malt smell that plays nicely.		T: Solid hop presence, but not overly bitter. Very fruity, as in grapefruit hops. A caramel malt flavor balances the beer nicely, but the hop punch is solid.		M: Quite smooth, but on the thinner side for my liking.		D: It's a pretty good IPA, not overly hoppy or bitter, but enjoyable.";;;;;;;;;;
"I happily accepted a bottle of this at my mate's house recently, I must admit I was worried I would be given a bottle of lager.		The beer poured a dark bronze colour with a decent white head that displayed solid retention throughout the drink.		The nose was completely bland, slight hint of malts and nothing else a very disappointing start.		However this was rectified in the taste. Malts mainly dominate the taste buds with a strong fruity after-taste, a medium - light bodied beer which left a dry taste and also a delayed after-taste of spices.		A good beer, at 6% it may be a bit too strong for a session beer, however it was very drinkable.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured an amber brown with reddish yellow accents that had a thin head and left a little bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was pretty sweet consisting of honey, wood, very slight bourbon, rich with caramel and some minty peppermint notes to it but with noticeable booze as well. Upfront on the palate caramel, honey, and that pepermint/mint flavor stike first along with woody bourbon accents and a good booze presence to warm it up. The brew was medium to full in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, minty, but boozy finish. It drank pretty good considering the booze punch and I'm really starting to dig wheatwines.;;;;;;;;;;
(Served in an American pint glass);;A- This beer has a warm reddish brown body with a strong carbonation of big bubbles and a thin creamy/bubbly head that fades to a ring pretty quickly.;;S- This beer has a hop aroma of pine with a light pineapple weed note. There is a very light pineapple sweetness to it that comes through when it is warm. ;;T- This beer has flavors of pine hops that are a bit dark in character. There is a smooth herbal note to the hops that finish with a soft sweetness. The note of pale malt has a soft chalk taste to it with some biscuit notes and a light toasted malt hint aswell. The bitterness from the hops lingers after the finish with notes of dry grapefruit and it is the strongest part of the taste. ;;M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with no alcohol or astringency in it. ;;D- This beer has big hops but not really that juicy taste that I usually expect form a big hoppy beer. This has a unique profile to the hops without the malt sweetness that boost the hop sensation.
"Poured from a bottle into my European pint glass.		A: A nice deep amber orange color with a nice one finger off white head. Nice glass lacing.		S: A rich smell of citrus hops that pretty much takes over. Not really overpowering, just very evident and enjoyable. A sweeter malty undertone is present, but it is far from the predominant smell here.		T: Citrus and floral hops bitterness give you the first taste, but the hops are quickly subdued by a rich sweet malty flavor the tones the hops way down. The hops flavor is still there, but it is blended very nicely with the sweet malt flavor. Maybe even a bit of candy sweetness on the tongue, all the while the hops just keep showing up with every sip. A very well balanced DIPA that if anything swings more towards the sweet malty side. This DIPA is quite different from many of the face smacking hop monsters.		M: A medium mouthfeel with some decent oily charactaristics. It is however not overpowering and I think the 10% ABV is very well hidden. No real alcohol burn on the finish either. 		D: To me this beer is very drinkable. If you want to sit down and enjoy a very well balanced DIPA that won't kill your palate with hops, but still gives you a nice hoppy flavor.		Overall this is a solid DIPA that is nice to have sitting in the fridge for a change of pace. Hats off to Stoudts for making a beer with a different twist but it still oh so enjoyable.";;;;;;;;;;
*Note: I am not a huge Imperial Stout fan but I have been wanting to try this one for a while...;;A- Pours a jet black motor oil style body with a creamy coffee colored foam head that leaves some good lacing.;;S- Wow...this is one of the best/most aromatic coffee noses that I have ever come across. Roasted coffee (java or mocha?) and sweet chocolate scents completely dominate the nose. A light toasted malt and oatmeal can be detected as well. I could sit here smelling this all day. I wonder if Founders and Glade would team up to make a Breakfast Stout air freshener?;;T- A huge rush of coffee taste initially with a roasted/burnt flavor of cocoa and bittersweet chocolate. A sweet malt backbone helps to balance the bitterness of the cocoa and coffee (definitely not a hoppy bitterness). Toasted flavors of grain and oatmeal are more apparent with warming. A fairly substantial alcohol presence can be detected as well.;;M- Big and bold with a full body and velvety smooth feel. Medium/low carbonation but it works well with the style. ;;D- This is a palate smasher of a stout with tons of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors. The alcohol is fairly noticeable and turns this into a sipping beer. A fantastic brew that won't easily turn into a session.
"Drank on tap at Old Town Pizza in Portland in pint glass.		A: Solid amber hue; lacing in glass.		S: Slightly grass smell, hoppy notes on the nose.		T & M: This was a quite hoppy pale ale but not overly so, this is a nicely done pale ale. 		D: Highly drinkable, this is a pale ale that could definitely be sessionable. I really enjoyed this beer but get a feeling that I'll have a hard time finding this in Dallas.";;;;;;;;;;
"22 oz. Viscous near black pour. Some brown bubbles, sticks to the glass a bit. Big bourbon aroma, accented with molasses, vanilla, caramel, just hints of roast malt. Taste is a real nice balance with the barrel on the stout qualities, not as potent as the nose. Roasted malt, chocolates with light amounts of dark red fruits. Vanilla, caramel, oak follow. Warming, but not as much as the aroma would suggest. Thick and full bodied. Finish is lingering toffee sweetness and oak barrel. The only thing I would say this could use is some more bittering of coffee and hops. I expect barrel aging to negate some of that anyways though. Good drinkability for the ""size"". A real nice variation on the excellent original Boris.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a deep dark oil black with a dark tan head that left lacing and sticky sap looking head on the top. 		Smell of strong bourbon, coffee, dark roasted malts. 		Taste of sweet malt, bourbon and oakiness. Roasted chocolate and caramelized sugars are heavily in attendance. The booziness is mainly presented in odor, but this tastes quite palatable and very smooth at the high abv. At first I am reminded of Bourbon County Stout but this seems to be smoother and more evenly rounded. Both are great, I think this one is a little better and does not burn as much as BCS. 		Lots of bourbon, chocolate and coffee. Not much roast, which surprised me. Little to no oak. However, the flavors present are excellent. They mesh well and are wonderfully assertive. Lots of vanilla and some caramel, as well. Actually, this is one of the most vanilla-forward beers I've had in awhile. Alcohol is present but stays inside the bourbon aroma.		Mouthfeel is relatively thick with a light carbonation. There is no ugly charred flavors rearing their head which makes this more desirable to me. I would say when compared to FBS, this is slightly smoother, not as dry with the oatmeal flavors and not as much char flavor whether or not it is just the bourbon barrel masking these flavors. 		Id def get more of these if they were not so pricey";;;;;;;;;;
"Brown 12oz bottle, colorful with no born on dating. The color poured out a cloudy, deep amber with a reddish hue. The 1/8 inch head dissipated almost immediately (maybe a bad pour the first time, but after the 6th one still nothing noteworthy). The scent was of light hops with a very slight fruit accent. The taste was bitter with a nice bite but a very smooth finish. The mouthfeel was bright and crisp with a nice tingle. I really enjoyed this beer, my first real ESB (I think I had a Pete's ESB before I really started ""tasting"" beer). It was just bitter enough, very crisp and clean and nice and smooth at the tail end. I'm very interested in sampling some of the other Stoudt's creations soon --- this one is a keeper and I will continue to explore ESB's.";;;;;;;;;;
"2nd review, I guess the server crash ate my other one...		Pours an effervescent honey color with 2+ fingers of pearl colored head. superior lacing & very good head retention as well		S: Lemons, biscuitty malt & grapefruit, plus some leafy hops once warm. I remember my 1st review having much better aroma, but got call em as I see em, this might one of those beers that is fantastic fresh, but suffers over time, not sure???		T: Follows the nose, plus a touch of flinty dryness up front. Grapefruit & buscuitty malt dance as this warms, plus some floral hops as well. Finishes crisp, citrussy & with a dryness that demands you get another one out of the fridge		MF: Medium bodied, fairly soft carbonation & superior balance		Through the roof drinkability. As long as I can get this & the frehness is there, this a must purchase every time I cross the Mizzou State line! If not the best fresh hop beer I've had it is in the top 3...";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: It's dark brown (slightly red when held to light). Head is about one finger. Retention was rather short and lace was light.		Smell: Very nice caramel malt aroma. Slight hint of dark fruit (raisin, perhaps). Alcohol is noticeable, but not strong smelling. On the outskirts is a toasted nut smell.		Taste: Initially, it's simply a very full, flavorful malty taste. Dark fruits taste is there. Slightly nutty. Alcohol is blended well and not noticeable. Seems a bit chocolaty on the way down.		Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's full bodied. Carbonation is excellent. ABV is perfect for this beer. Very drinkable. Overall, this is a very good beer. One I'll certainly drink again.";;;;;;;;;;
"Reviewed from notes.		Pours a moderate yellow straw color with a white head and a bit of lacing. The nose is slightly grainy and a bit of hops. The taste is slightly hoppy with some grain and straw. Light and crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this drinks pretty well, and I'll always have a soft spot as this was one of the beers that introduced me to ""good"" beer, as my grandpa always had this around.";;;;;;;;;;
One of the best Barrel-Aged Stouts I've ever had! The appearence is dark as dark can be with a beautiful creamy dark head. Smell very nice, Bourbon for sure! The taste is spot on. Exemplfies the style! Smoothe oily mouthfeel makes you yearn for the next sip!;;;;;;;;;;
"This beer is one of my favorites. It pours a beautiful copper, amber color with a small head that dissipates pretty quickly. The smell is my favorite part of this beer. It is a delicious hoppy, fruity, floral smell that just begs you to take a nice gulp. The flavor matches the smell, with fruity, citrus-y hops on front end that are rounded out with a really unique and delicious rye taste.	This beer is also very drinkable for 6.5+ and could easily be a session beer. This may not be for everyone, but in my opinion this is a unique and delicious creation from Founders(which is rapidly becoming a favorite brewery of mine).";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours black with thin brown head. Wetter than typical for imperial stouts.		Nose is vanilla, alcohol, roasted malt, wood, coffee.		Taste is sweet vanilla cream soda, a roasted chocolate malt blast, 	bourbon, finishes with a hint of wood and warming alcohol.		Creamy, with an alcoholic aftertaste and warm bourbon burn.		You could have more than one but you probably don't have more than a few.";;;;;;;;;;
"this new version on tap at the brewpub replaces the Belgian-style third ingredient with their newest hop monster, Red God IPA.		porterish appearance, dense lingering eggy foam of a beautiful tan color		aroma bursts with burnt caramel, nuttiness and mild hints of chocolate		taste is (no surprise) dominated by the sour cherries, but brings a nice, roasty bitterness along for the ride.. say hello to notes of coffee and cocoa to balance the strong fruit. my palate is confused and excited by this chaotic yet balanced porter. red god's hops contribute more to backing up the fruit than the bitter brown. post-swallow, im left with a dry, chestnutty bitter. body is perfect, medium and crisp with threats of heavy substance. 		drinkable.. well, except for the urge to stop and savour it. absolutely fabulous brew that needs to be commended for its dedication to beer tradition and at the same time, its experimentation and pushing of said envelope. 		a beer that will not be soon forgotten by this reviewer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Served at Birrificio Del Levante's HQ in Bitritto, IT (BA) in a stemmed pint glass.		A - Beer poured with a black colored body; dark, 3 finger dark creme, latte colored head; small amount of visible carbonation in the beer; moderate amount of sticky lacing formed on the side of the glass		S - Deep, deep fig fruit aroma; other dark fruit scents; very light traditional stout scents, like coffee, chocolate scents, subtle roasted malt notes; after warming up a bit, licroice become very overwhelming		T - Dark fruit flavors of fig and dates, very strong and controls most of the flavor profile; light roasted malt flavor; licorice		M - Nice smooth texture; has less body than most traditional stouts, but has has a nice light feel which makes you want to drink more (as informed by the beer master); little watery, could use more body; aftertaste is slightly bitter and is followed up by dry lingering flavors of fig and licorice 		D - Great stuff; I really liked this beer, fantastic flavor profile";;;;;;;;;;
Grabbed a bottle of this from Downtown Wine and Spirits tonight in Somerville. I passed on this beer the last time it was out because of the high price tag, but now that I can afford it, I am game. Pours out a nice reddish pink, with a finger of white/pink heading. The nose is of fresh raspberries, and that is about it, not artificial smelling either. Flavor is very sweet with raspberries, and again, that is about it for me, but this is not a bad thing by any means. Medium mouthfeel, and the alcohol is not present at all. It appears that they dialed it back a few notches with this batch, which is fine by me. My final thoughts are that this beer is delicious, and needs to be paired with some kind of dark chocolate dessert.;;;;;;;;;;
"12oz can into a Duvel tulip. No date, but I know it's at least a few months old as I got it in an in-person trade at DLD and forgot about it in my fridge until today. Oops.		A: A fairly fast pour results in two fingers of lusciously creamy off-white head perched atop a hazy orange body. Solid, rocky retention and lots of frothy lace. Quite nice indeed.		S: The hops have certainly faded, but still lend a nice bit of spice on top of the pure caramel malt. Simple, straightforward, balanced, and pleasant.		T: Follows the nose, but with a bit of extra hop bitterness on the finish; lightly resinous. Very tasty, classic pale ale. 		M: Medium body, lots of carbonation. A little bit too frothy, but not bad at all.		O: This is an eminently solid APA as it is, and I'm sure it would have been even better fresh (I've bumped it a half point to make up for my own foolishness in letting it sit for so long). I'd love to take a sixer on a camping trip. Craft cans FTW!		Cheers!";;;;;;;;;;
This is a great beer in the canned beer arena. Had no option but to drink this straight from the can so I can't comment on appearance. Had a nice scent of bitter citrus and pine. Hops contribute a moderate bitterness consisting of both grapefruit and pine flavors, on top of a lightly sweet pale malt backbone.. Mouthfeel was crisp and pleasing with generous carbonation. Had a couple of these on a hike and found them to be great for the occasion.;;;;;;;;;;
"2011 poured into my snifter.		Poured thick and black and beautiful. Very thin dark brown head, never even enough to cover the surface. Retreats quickly to a ring. Each drink leaves a nice ring around the glass. Nice retention on the lacing.		Nose is roasty, full.		Taste is exceptional. Dark roast coffee, dark chocolate bitter. Bitter, but not in a bad way. Flavor remains, but not like a bad aftertaste, just lingering goodness. Masks the 10.2 ABV quite well. Expected it to be hot being so fresh, but only a tiny bit boozy, nothing out of line for the style.		Mouthfeel is very pleasant, little carbonation, but enough. Coats the tongue nicely.		I could enjoy a couple of these.		Another +1 for Founders in my book.";;;;;;;;;;
"Again, I've found an IPA that is well worth not only having again, but stocking the refrigerator. Nice presentation from Centennial, a finger of froth with a cider orange body. Good nose, strong on hops--as with the very good taste--but subtle on the fruit, which comes out better in the taste, which was very good. Lots more fruit in the taste than the nose, with apples, orange peel, lemon, and grapefruit accosting the taste buds. Excellent.		This is something I'll be sure to grab again. The dense hops are well incorporated, front and center but smooth, with a sterling mouthfeel keeping the flavors in harmony. Very good brew.";;;;;;;;;;
"A Belgian ale brewed with barley, wheat, spelt (spelt?) and oats. I'd never had a beer brewed with spelt before, so this was a must buy for me.		A: Cloudy brass with relatively active carbonation. Foamy eggshell head has nice retention, but sadly left little lace behind.		S: I think this beer's style should be refiled under Witbier, because that's what it smells like. A sourdough biscuit quality dominates. A sharp coriander and clove bite adds a spiciness to the proceedings. Citrus is there with a combination of lemon and orange.		T: Tastes like a Witbier too. Quite dry and tart. The sourdough biscuit quality from the nose transitions nicely into the flavor. Husky raw grains are front and center. Balance is created in the form of a coriander presence that's more spicy than bitter. Finishes dry and tart, with a puckering lemon flavor, plus a slight sour note.		M: The grainy medium body feels coarser than most beers of this style (perhaps from the spelt?). Carbonation level is about right.		D: This was certainly different. The spelt and oat additions added an extra level of complexity that was nice to explore. Relatively low ABV makes this beer easy to drink too quickly. Sour finish is something I have to be in the right mood for, but fits this beer well. Overall, I'm glad I picked this up.";;;;;;;;;;
A - Pours thin into a glass with a glazed bronze head that vanishes quickly. Some foam remains on the rim. ;;S - Just a great smell of cocoa and coffee. The cocoa travels first and then the coffee just hits you. Almost like smelling freshly ground coffee in the bag with cocoa. ;;T - A slightly sweet cocoa sensation with a coffee explosion. Some oats on the aftertaste as well as an earthy bite. Taste actually got a little better as the temperature increased. ;;M - Good smooth texture with little carbonation. ;;D - A tasty stout that I could probably have with waffles or pancakes. yum!;;
"Poured a copperish orange color with a magnificent head that retained well and left great decoration lacing on my glassware.		Smells of citrusy and piney hops with a good sweet malt backbone to it.		Taste is extremely balanced between the hop punch and the maltiness. Much grapefruit in the finish, nice and citrusy, with the malt fighting its way throughout the flavor. Nice brew!		Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated.		Very drinkable IPA despite its hig halcohol content which may hinder the drinkability for most. Despite that, as said, everything else is there to make you want to have one after another...just be careful, it will creep up on ya! Great IPA from Founders...I'd expect nothing less form them.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours an opaque black colour with hints of brown. Almost no head. This looks very thick. Smell is huge of roasted malt, oatmeal, vanilla and sweet raisins. Flavour has a kick of bitterness to join the roasted flavours. Very delicious. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Hard to drink a lot of this with the abv, but I'm having no issue polishing off this bomber after my first ever 10km run. One of the better imperial stouts I've had.;;;;;;;;;;
"500 mL bottle. Haven't bought this in a while, so I'm guessing two years on this.		Pours a very dark brown into an imperial pint glass, with a tan head that just barely fits in what room is left in the glass. Not a lot of initial retention, but the remaining ring left better lacing than I expected.		Nose is a really wonderful concoction of chocolate, dark fruits (plum, then raisin, then some sort of sweet berry) and just enough alcohol. If I remember correctly the alcohol was a bit more present, but overly so, when this was fresh.		Taste is sweet up front with carmelized sugar, and plenty of plum right behind. Alcohol isn't overpresent, but is quite a bit stronger than with Sinebrychoff, both fresh and aged. The complexity of the flavor profile, along with the alcohol, make this seem a bit spicy - quite a (pleasant!) workout for the palate. Alcohol warming in the throat as I swallow. Finish is more roasty than the rest of the profile, with a mildly bitter coffee flavor noted in the aftertaste. Very good.		At this age (or maybe it started out like this, I don't remember) carbonation is on the low side, with a fantastic full smooth mouthfeel. No trouble letting this brew glide across the tongue savoring the flavor. They don't get much better.		ABV isn't much higher than Sinebrychoff, but once again I find this affects me quite a bit more...I can't have nearly as much of this as I'd like.";;;;;;;;;;
"Had this beer for the first time in November at a local bar in Saugatuck, MI. I had only heard just how tasty it was from fellow beer lovers. I haven't gotten it out of my head since. I have dreams of this beer, it's that good.		The color is dark as expected from a stout. It smells of espresso and chocolate. My first sip I was surprised how light it was in the mouth. The taste is just a good as the smell and for a stout which one or two is my max I felt I could drink this one all night..yikes! 		For me this beer is an A. I recommend it to everyone especially in these cold winter months. Next year I will be sure to stock up before it sells out.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle (bottled 7/14/10) poured into a Brooklyn snifter.		A - Pours a nearly opaque and extemely dark brown color (almost black) with marginal ruby highlights when held to a very bright light. A quckly dissipating, creamy looking tan head that falls to a thick collar with lines of lacing left behind.		S - Green and citrusy hops up front layered on top of a rich smelling malt base filled with a good caramelly aspect to it and some nice roasted malt too. Very fruity...lots of dark fruits, prunes, cherries, and maybe a touch of raspberry too. Alcohol is also noticeable in the nose.		T - Dark roasted malt, charcoal, burnt toast, coffee leave the first impression with a sizeable hop bitterness and citrusy hop flavor. Light caramel and tons of dark fruit in the middle and a lingering bitterness and slight astringency into the aftertaste. Alcohol is rather well hidden in the flavor profile despite the 12% level. A light kiss of vanilla enters the flavor profile as the beer warms up a bit.		M - Medium bodied, not as thick as I expected it to be and perhaps a bit lighter than desired too. Alcohol is only marginally noticeable and really only after the swallow with a lingering ""burn"" on the back of the throat that is noticeable on the exhale. Carbonation is just on the low side of medium...gives a somewhat creamy feel.		D - Nice beer overall. Barleywine?...I don't know, had a lot of imperial stout-like qualities in my opinion, but I suppose barleywine is an ok style descriptor here too. Seems like Founders rendition of SN Bigfoot, but not quite as enjoyable, at least in my opinion. Think I'll hold on to some to see how it ages...perhaps do a side by side some time with some Bigfoot vintages...";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a snifter from a 22 oz bottle. Appears a complete black color with a thin dark brown head that leaves a little bit of lacing. The black is absolutely midnight dark and is beautiful, the head, slightly less than impressive.		The nose is complex. Lots of bitter chocolate, roasted malts, grains, slight hints of yeast and some alcohol notes. There is something present that I don't normally get in a stout, but it is definitely welcoming. The taste is also complex with bitter chocolate, roasted malts and the grainy notes as well. The alcohol is much better hidden in the taste than in the nose, although there is still a hint of it. This finishes slightly bitter.		Mouthfeel is full bodied, with an average amount of carbonation. Leaves a thick film on the inside of your mouth with each sip. Overall, this is a great brew! Another wonderful RIS with a full body and extremely complex flavors. Not the best stout I've ever experienced but still very enjoyable.";;;;;;;;;;
"1 pt .9 fl. oz heavy duty, dark brown bottle. No date that I could find.		A. Poured hazy amber, nice head w/fair retention and lacing.		S. Very slight acedic but flowery aroma		T. Moderately malty sweet and nice hop balance. Nice bittery finish		M. Creamy smooth nice easy carbonation.		Anything Monty Python gets my attention. Getting past that, this was a delightful beginnning to the end of a warm day. Paid $3.99, I suppose was worth the price of admission. Wish I had another one..bummer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Founders CBS		Pours a dark tar black with a small short 	livid head. Aroma of coffee, booze, syrup and chocolate. In the taste, aggressive bourbon, roast, coffee, oak and a pronounced alcohol burn. The stout qualities are there, with a black roast flavor and boozey barrel notes. At the end of the sip there is a sugary residual sweetness due to the maple syrup, along with an astringent bitterness from the hops, coffee and bourbon. Mouthfeel is full bodied and well carbonated. Overall, a treat of a beer and worth seeking. Enjoyed at Fat Heads Brewers Brunch 2011.";;;;;;;;;;
"My local Co-op started offering Founders, so I did what any reasonable person would do and bought one of each kind they had. This is my fifth Founders brew and might just be my favorite so far.		This one has a nice, rich, hazy orange color. An inch of puffy head formed on the pour, with some good lacing as I worked my way down the glass.		I knew I was in for a treat when I picked up an intense lychee/sweet pink grapefruit aroma. It smells like some perfectly ripe tropical fruit. What's awesome is that there's an equally intense lychee taste that opens up when you take a sip. The fruitiness stays for a second or so, dissipates into some dry, piney hoppiness mixed in with the rye bite. As the bitterness fades I start to pick up the lychee again. There is a lot going on in this one!		Final verdict: a big winner. It amazes me the kind of flavors a brewery can wring from a relatively limited amount of ingredients! I'm going to be picking up this in quantity as soon as possible.";;;;;;;;;;
12 oz bottle pours a cloudy amber chestnut body with a small beige head that quickly falls into skim and sheet lacing. Aroma has a bold maltiness of caramel and molasses with citrusy hop notes in the background. Medium body with an apt medium low carbonation. Taste is scorched caramel and pine and citrus hop bitterness. Fruity notes of apples and oranges add an interesting dimension. Pine hop bitterness becomes assertive midway through and stay to the finish. Finishes with a pine cone hops bitterness. Well done!;;;;;;;;;;
"Tried on tap at the brewery.		Slight pale gold colour, mild brown tinge to it and considerable haze with light bead. Head is off-white and sunk quickly to a ring of whispy lace. Could use a more opaque haze - or at least it wouldn't be unwelcome in the style - and more head, but decent anyway.		Smells very funky. A salty, corporeal aroma with complex bouquet of fresh orange, barnyard animal smell, some peppery spice and lavender. Maybe a bit on the rank side, but it's plenty saison-y and there's plenty to like here as well.		Taste strikes me as a bit subdued at first. Quite sweet on the assault with mild caramel malt that then starts to gather steam, developing rich earthy flavours midway. Some barnyard funk with soil, hay and a corporeal edge round out the mid-palate. Some nice bitterness late, slightly phenolic with a twang of citrus at the very back. Really quite a drinkable saison with good complexities that aren't too heavy to lower its accessibility.		Fine tingly texture with a slight viscous body. Very nice.		Great beer here by the MP brewery. Saison seems to me a difficult style to get right and not many Aussie breweries are trying it. But this is stylistically bang on the money and has enough pleasant flavours not to put off the average lager drinker. 		(Once I'd finished my reviews of my four-beer sample paddle, I put the half-full glasses in the midst of my three not-really-beer-drinking friends to taste, and this one came out the favourite.)		Nice job.";;;;;;;;;;
"From a 12 oz. long neck brown bottle with a freshness date on the carrier, fall '06 version.		Poured a hazy golden orangey bronze with a foamy off-white head that settled into a thin sudsy lacing.		Aromas of nutmeg, clove, pumpkin juicy and a sweet grainy maltiness.		Good carbonation and a crisp, smooth light-medium bodied mouthfeel.		Tastes of clove, nutmeg, light cinnamon, pumpkin flesh and fruity as well, a subtle hoppiness towards the end and a sweet grainy maltiness.		A seasonal from O'Fallon that I look forward to every fall, not the best, but one of the better pumpkin ales out there.";;;;;;;;;;
"A ""summer barleywine"" from CBC; as the menu describes meant to sip, have a kick, and still refresh. Presented from the tap in a 10oz. narrow wine glass the beer was a light ruby red, orange/light amber color. No head and no lacing. Few signs of carbonation at all.		The nose is very strong with white wine aromas. Some grape and soft fruit. I picked up a hint of peach.		Taste is innitially soft and mellow with a very wine-y like taste. White grape and a soft alcohol. Nothing here intimates 10.75 ABV. Soft summer fruits and malt dominate the palate. The beer has a soft mouthfeel, about the consistancy of juice. Only mildly, carbonated.		An interesting twist here to a summer beer. As the menu described it, refreshing with a kick. Light body and little hop presence make it good for the hot weather. And the subtle wine-like alcohol presence give it the strengh needed for a barley wine. This one lacked the big screaming hop presence of American Barley wines and instead goes for smoothness, balance, and subtle strength. A very nice selection.";;;;;;;;;;
Yazoo has just installed a bottling line in the last month. The Dos Perros has a deep chestnut brown color with a disappointingly vanishing head. Rich sweet Malt dominates the nose and the flavor with nuances of hop bitterness for balance. Finish is very smooth. This is not my favorite style but I could drink alot of this. Very nicely done brown ale.;;;;;;;;;;
Picked up a single at Exito strolling through the beer aisle. Bottle smell is malty and slightly citrusy and mostly zesty. Pours to a nice red bronze with a multi bubble head that is like sea foam sticking on the glass as it recedes, slowly. Taste is very hoppy up front and well, throughout, but more prominent in the finish. Good aroma and bitterness. Seems to be a Cascade aroma with a Fuggles flavor and taste. Very English-like as was their goal. Almost approaching a brown ale in flavor but with the citrusy aromas I would peg it as a West Coast Red. Mouthfeel is spot on. This is a very good brew.;;;;;;;;;;
"This review taken from notes written about two weeks ago, as I recently moved and did not have internet access, but didn't let that stop me from reviewing.		I intended on a nice leisurely pour into a snifter with this one, and ended up up-ending it just for a half finger of sandy colored head. This dissipated in a minute to leave nothing on top of the beer but a thick ring. Body was a nice orange-brown color. 		The aroma on this is all malt. Caramel malt is strong and a hint of bready malt is detected after some searching. Raisins and figs are also a nice strong aroma here, and I detected a whiff or two of alcohol on the end.		The taste was to the nose, with the addition of a nice bitterness on the end that just drew me in and made me want more. Sweeter than expected.		I found this beer nice and thick. Full bodied, with carbonation that was just enough to ease it over your tongue. Although I caught a bit of alcohol in the nose, it was not apparent anywhere else in the beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"brown bottle poured into S. Smith pint glass		A - appearance is great, pours as thick as oil and makes a head (well, condsidering I poured it about a half foot about the glass) there is quite ample is great lacing all over. the head is a dark tan color. the body is black and opaque, no way in hell of getting around that.		S - there is a good amount of coffee and bitter chocolate up in front, along with a spicy alcohol making the nose tingle a bit. there is some sweet toffee/caramel to be had in the background, though not much.		T - wow, this is actually like biting into a huge dark chocolate espresso bean. that pretty much sums up the forward taste. the chocolate dominates over the bitterness of the coffee to note, and the alcohol taste comes out quite well once the brew has sat in my mouth for a small while. If the beer can get better then I am dumbfounded as to how, maybe it can actually give me some sort of sexual favor, or come with 20 bucks while it is at it, that would make it better, though not much else. the finish has some noticeable alcohol and bitterness of coffee like tendencies. I don't know how much more to complement this beer other than say it is amazing		MF&D - for how bold and big a body this beer is the viscosity could have been a bit thicker, this would have let me sip it rather than take mouth sized gulps. though this is certainly not one to chug. the drinkability is excellent in my view, though something thicker would have been more satisfying.";;;;;;;;;;
"Found for a reasonable price in an upscale Nashville, TN liquor shop, this attractive smoked imperial porter begins by pouring a deep black, with a sizeable tan head. Lovely, frilly, ornate lacing.		Nose says smoke, wood, dark fruit, and peat. Very malty, appealing, and complex.		Taste is at first woody and smoky, followed by more wood. This is a nicely hearty and potent brew, with the heavy flavor profile masking the high 9% alcohol content. Superb! And one I'd gladly pick up again.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance  Blacker than black with a very dark tan head that foamed up big and lasted forever, lacing the glass as it went down.		Smell  Big, very dark chocolate leads the way here followed by deep, roasted malts and fine espresso beans (not espresso but the raw, whole beans). Theres also a nice hop balance in there (citrus maybe) plus a soft sour tang.		Taste  Everything comes out beautifully at the taste. For all the big smells up front, this one is very even and balanced at the tongue. This is almost like a milkshake complete with cocoa and sweet chocolate, espresso (subdued from the nose), malt, and a very light, barely detectable sweet/sour note.		Mouthfeel  Smooth and chewy and medium in the body. This is a serious stout with a somewhat bitter finish.		Drinkability  One of the better stouts that Ive tasted from the NW. Most of them are pretty lame (Hales Pikop Andropov's almost made me vomit), but this one is the real deal.		Update  I rated this originally with a 2003 vintage so thought it would be run to take another look at it using an 04 bottle. It happily lost the slight sourness this time around and really is one of the better examples of the style brewed here in the PacNW.		Update  I had a 2005 vintage in May and found it to be very consistent. This is about as good as it gets here in Seattle, and this wonderfully brewery is just a few blocks from where I work.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours with a nice head that stuck around. The smell has lots of those typical BA stout smells - vanilla, chocolates, roasted malts, oak, alcohol. The taste follows those line with vanilla being the dominating note for me. The roasted malts and some mild bitterness and some coffee comes out nicely too. The mouthfeel is good, similar to BORIS and it finished with big roasty notes. Overall, just a well made ba ris. If you can get some you shouldn't be disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;
"This beer is very dark when poured into the glass. I used the side of the glass and ended up with about a 1/2-inch head, which I liked. It smelled smoky, and I was expecting a bit of smoke flavor, but I didn't realize how strong it was. Instantly I felt like I was by a campfire. This beer has a fairly alcoholic undertone, but it can be ignored easily. The mouthfeel is very thick and grainy, making this beer slightly harder to drink than something less flavorful.		All in all, the only problem is that it's such a treat that I couldn't see myself drinking a whole lot of it.";;;;;;;;;;
"I had the good luck of spending quality time on business last year in the Philly (PA) area not far from the Black Angus. I made the trip over to Stoudt's brewery for dinner at the Angus and was stunned by their Triple! Wow, what a taste treat. A golden (orange?)nectar with an aroma of fruit and spices that grabs your attention. I carried four 22oz bombers back with me the next day on my return flight to Chi-town. Wish I could get Stoudt products here in the Chicago area, but alas the don't distribute to Illinois.		The taste and mouthfeel are outstanding for a Belgium Triple, especially an American Belgium of this type. One bottle of this tasty treat will warm your spirits, a second will give you insight on Ben Franklin's quote about how beer is proof that God loves us. Stoudt's triple was an excellent, soul warming experience.";;;;;;;;;;
"An orange-tan colored beer, almost clear, not a lot of head but nice lacing. 		Definitely grapefruit hops, some sweetness, a little bit of fruits and malts.		Tastes quite good. Piney grapefruit hops are the dominant flavor. The malts make for a nice background along with a very nice rye flavor. Somewhat sweet but not too much. 		Feels very rich and thick, medium bodied with a pleasantly lingering bitterness that's not too overpowering. 		Very drinkable. My favorite from founder's so far.";;;;;;;;;;
Served a nice clear amber color with some white headskie on top. Alas, no pints allowed for an 8% beer? That's a strike against. Guess what... hoppy hop is in effect with a 120 ibu reported. Not perfectly balanced as one may expect from a dipa, but I think this works in its favor as this beer outperforms the regular IPA in my opinion. I'll have another.;;;;;;;;;;
"Which of these items don't belong to this beer? 10% ABV, Double IPA style, or 99 cents for a 12 ounce bottle? Actually, they all apply to the bottle I got at Vendome, which was in the markdown section for some reason. Never having a DIPA before, I took a flyer on this low-risk/ high reward brew. Let's get on to it:		A thick, compact head rises from the beer. It's hoppy alright, mixed with scents of piney tropical fruits. I was expected a blitz of hops in the taste, but it wasn't as intense as I was expecting. Flavors of orange, mango, sweet malts, and a hoppy finish dominate the taste. Despite a warm feeling from the 10% ABV which burned as it went through my chest, it was easy to drink for such a style. Because of that, keep track of how much you've had of this if you plan to operate machinery afterwards.";;;;;;;;;;
"This is a big black porter with a bit of off-white head. Holding it up to the light, there is just a tinge of crimson at the edges of the glass; the rest is black. The smell is just like an iced espresso. The taste was all deeply roasted malts, some bitterness and residual sweetness. Mouthfeel was thick and slightly silky. For such a big flavor, this remains very drinkable. An excellent porter.";;;;;;;;;;
Black with a small milk chocolate colored head that only endures for a few seconds before sounding retreat. Smells of big, rich roasted malts, very sweet, yet bitter at the same time. Somewhat smokey with some soft vanilla and black licorice notes as well. Very rich malt flavor as well. A little roasted malt bitterness with some coffee flavor and something reminiscient of oaky tannins that give a somewhat sour vanilla flavor as it warms. Very warming alcoholic finish. Very thick and viscous, drinks like a meal.;;;;;;;;;;
Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub. Solid porter with expresso coffee and above average mouthfeel. Bitterness without being mouth puckering. Very dark brown colour with tons of lace following through. Carbonation was right there. Chocolate stouty aroma, some licorice in the taste. Drying finish.;;;;;;;;;;
This beer is truly outstanding. It is somewhat light in flavor and flavored with coffee and smokiness. Delicious.;;Appearance is an inky dark with a fairly minimal dark head. Aroma is of coffee. Coffee notes permeate the taste along with a taste reminiscent of a Rauschbier. This beer feels good in the mouth and is wonderfully drinkable.;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Delirium Tremens snifter/tulip. Pours a heavely dark black with about a finger or two of medium tan head. Retention is a non-issue as it dissapates relatively quickly but settles to a nice creamy surface. Spotty but sticky lacing.		Aroma is a little weird. It reminds me of how Smuttynose Imperial Stout smells. It has a mild medicinal aroma. If you can get past that, there's some great coffee and chocolate notes. Wow, this beer smells thick! Is that possible?? I guuess I should add it's rather malty too, which isn't a bad thing.		Tastes a lot better than it smells! Very malty and thick, tons of heavy chocolate, oatmeal, and coffee notes. Carbonation is mild, great mouthfeel! Booze stands out well in the swallow. Has an extrememly tasty chocolate aftertaste! A very good stout!";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bought at Capones in Norristown. Poured into a pint glass.		Appearance: Finger tall white head above a golden/amber color. Streaming carbonation lets the foam hang on for a little while, but it slowly recedes to a thin layer. Leaves spotty lacing.		Smell: Floral hoppy aroma. Oily citrus, grapefruit and grassy aromas are most prevalent. Really a nice smelling beer, wish more had this aroma.		Taste: Bitterness up front gives way to a semi-oily grapefruit and lemon flavor that is very good. Bitterness returns in the middle and lasts through the finish with lingering grapefruit flavors on the tongue. Has some piney and grassy notes, but they're not very prevalent and only appear once the beer warms. Enough malt backbone to balance the bitterness, but the hops dominate.		Mouthfeel: Lingering bitterness with a bit of an oily feel after the finish. Medium carbonation that hits you just about everywhere. I'd say medium body, but certainly not challenging or filling.		Drinkability: Super beer. ABV is hidden well, maybe just a hint at the end once its warmer. A sixer wouldn't be an issue for me.		Despite my love for hops, I usually ignore a lot of harvest ales in favor of pumpkin ales. Glad I didn't overlook this one this year.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into my Duvel tulip.		a - Pours a hazy dark orange-copper color with one finger of off white head and moderate carbonation evident. Light lacing left on the glass and an inch of head throughout drinking it.		s - Smells of spices, pumpkin, bready malts, light cinnamon, and light ginerbread. Pretty nice, and a little heavy on the spices. 		t - Tastes of spices, pumpkins, gingerbread, nutmeg, cinnamon, and bready malts. Again, heavy on spices, thought the gingerbread comes through a bit more than the nose. A small step up from the nose.		m - Medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Pretty easy to drink.		o - Overall a good pumpkin ale. Seemed a bit heavy on the spices, especially in the nose, but a good pumpkin ale. Very easy to drink and would like to have it again.";;;;;;;;;;
"This Nut Brown Ale is beautiful in appearance. Good clarity, as in not opaque, but translucent brown. A bit of head graced the initial pour, disseminating quickly into thin froth and ring lacing. Odors of puffed oats and brown sugar infuse the nose. Sugarsmacks?		Wheat germ and honey flavors combine with roasted malt and herbal touches of mild hops to create a delightful robust ale.		A thin to medium body allows for a rather enjoyable drinking experience. The ABV is not listed, but I would estimate right around 5%, making this Brown Ale a close second to its English counterparts.		Nice job BBC.";;;;;;;;;;
I was really impressed with this beer. Low carbonation for an ale which is fine. I can taste notes of caramel and cinnamon. This is truly a treat for the holidays. Overall I am pleased to have tried this beer as recommended by a friend. Drink On. HOG;;;;;;;;;;
"I could dring this beer all night.	Appearance: Clear Amber copper, with a 2"" off-white head.	Smell: Some hop bitterness, with a hint of sugary malt.	Taste: Not an overpowering hop or malt profile. Actually, somewhat bland, with some pine hops. biscuity malt starts to emerge as the beer warms 	Mouthfeel: Smooth. mildly carbonated.	Overall: You may call this beer boring. Nothing stands out, but nothing overpowers. Enjoyable beer for a fall afternoon watching some football.";;;;;;;;;;
"Chilled bottle into a glass. A generous extra from boatshoes. Thanks!		A: Pours a pitch black body with a nice finger of mocha head. That long-lastin', lace-leavin' sumbitch takes his sweet time before moseyin' off into the-... oh, sorry. Anyway, this beer is a reminder that dark beers can have a nice head. I think I'm grading too leniently on some stouts and porters that lose their foam immediately. 		T: Roasted malt and chocolate up front; this doesn't have that over-roasted, slightly burnt flavor I find off-putting in similar beers. Coffee grounds, a touch of anise and smoke. Slightly bitter cocoa. While this isn't a hoppy beer, it's evident that some earthy hops went into it. A very balanced, flavorful taste. I can't help but be thoroughly impressed. 		M: Founders typically does a good job with the mouthfeel. I'm surprised at how thick this beer feels for a relatively light ABV, but I suppose that attests to a nice presence of residual sugar. It certainly feels sweet and heavy, though not cloying. In fact, it finishes with a drying presence. 		D: An excellent example of a style that seems to be forgotten in favor of EXTREME!!! imperial porters with adjuncts. It's nice to revisit the basics. I think there are one or two I'd rank ahead of this one, but it's up there.";;;;;;;;;;
Aroma is absolutely heavenly - smoky with firm tones of quality coffee, molasses and sweet chocolate and a hint of licorice. It pours a deep, rich, warm opaque sable with a thick dark tan head that leaves some good lacing. Mouth filling flavor has a decided mocha core, quality coffee and chocolate plus licorice, molasses and even a bit of hoppy bitterness. Smooth flavor has a firm and biting fizz, and it leaves a smoky, slightly bitter, tingly finish. If ever you are in Oregon, grab a bottle - or better yet, grab two or three so you have something to trade.;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours very dark, near black with very little head to it, although what was there stuck around for the ride.		Smells fairly sweet of malts and a good amount of coffee (it's called Breakfast Stout for a reason). After warming a little some more hoppy smells begin to show themselves.		As with the smell the taste is fairly sweet with big malty and roasted flavors with the additional coffee and some chocolate. Again, as it warms the hops show up on the back end with a subtle bitterness that I found really enjoyable.		It is a thick beer that had just the right amount of carbonation and went down smoothly.		Overall, a very high quality stout.";;;;;;;;;;
Ruby brown. Generous off-white head receding to a big ring. Aroma is heavily smoky, youve got to like this aspect. Theres just tons of ham, bacon, pork. Its intensely meaty and feels like a meal in itself, very expressive and one that you can smell from far. In this ragard, this can do wonders as a welcome home beer or a barbecue apetizer. It remains rather sweet too with its maple suggestions, peppery and salty, theres even leather and woody flavours in there. This is pretty complex with tons of character. The oldest sharp smoked cheddar youll come across. Body is medium-thick, fulfilling with a bit above average carbonation. Mild bitterness in the finish balances from the rather sweet malts. Fantastic. Probably the smokiest beer on the planet and it will never get on your nerves. Actually, I wished some brewery would make something smokier and as pleasant than this, but this is an old mans daydream. Nevertheless, this remains the father of smoked beers and an experience to enjoy as often as possible. A truly unique product of great appeal.;;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. 		Pours a crystal clear golden straw color with 2 1/2 fingers of brite-white head. Retains with nearly a 1/2 finger of smooth and creamy looking retention that has a fantastic flareup when swirled, leaving back some great looking spotty lacing that sticks like glue. The aroma is just LUSH smelling with tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. There are also surrounding notes of floral, herbal, and spicy hops, as well as some additional sweet tones of bread and caramel in the nose. 		The taste is a spicy and tingling hop bitterness up front that is nicely balanced by fresh feeling citrus and bready caramel malt sweetness. Finshes very dry, bitter, and warming on the palette. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with an extremely smooth and creamy carbonation in the mouth and a nice feeling underlying slickness that helps this glide across the palette. Unfortunately, I'm also picking up a little too much of the nearly 10% ABV in this. It lessens somewhat as it warms but this combines with the present bitterness to give off a bit of a sting at times, which unfortunately hurt the drinkibility some for me. 		It's good to see Founders releasing a DIPA in bottles and this one brings the thunder, with a big time fresh tasting mix of hops and citrus. A touch too hot maybe but I still really enjoyed this. Another great beer from one of my favorite breweries.";;;;;;;;;;
"2009 vintage	This beer pours a pitch black with a two finger mininmum brown head tha slowly dissipates leaving some of the thickest lacing I have ever seen.	I smell a lot of coffee, chocolate, and some smoked malts.	Huge bitter chocolate, expresso and roasted malt flavor. A little smokey flavors as well and it all melds perfectly.	The lightest mouth feel of any stout like whip cream making me want drink after drink.";;;;;;;;;;
"Excellent porter.		Has a beautiful chocolate color with an awsome tan head. Smell of Nuts, chocolate, and fig are present. Has a very smooth cahracter when you taste it. Seems to age pretty well. My dad and I had a bottle that was a year old and it was excellent. 8.1% ABV is nice and it finishes well. Awsome job Poland.";;;;;;;;;;
"[thanks to JonD for the bottle]		Black with brown cap which stays as a small fuzz and pretty light lace. Aroma is huge coffee with some vodka and vanilla, overall very strong and wonderful. Flavor is again coffee, alcohol, and vanilla. It doesn't develop as much as I would like, but what it is is nice. Really like liquid dessert, reminds me a bit of tiramisu. Smooth as silk. Thankfully the bourbon notes are not over-the-top and actually complement the malt and hop flavors.		Very well done. From the name of this, I did not expect to enjoy it, but it must be a blend and not 100% from the wood. I wouldn't mind having one of these every so often as a nightcap.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a slightly hazy orangey brown color with a small wispy khaki colored head that settled into a sparse cap.		The aroma is nice and smokey. The smoke is not too overpowering and it brings some charred wood and meaty notes. I don't pick up much beyond the smoke.		The taste is sweet and smokey. Some light caramel, candied sweetness and light fruitiness from the malt. The smoke is rich and brings wonderful charred wood notes. A bit meaty. This is a good style to add the smoked malts.		The feel is moderate with tingly carbonation. It is quite sweet on the palate but the smoke provides an earthy offset. Despite the smoke, it drinks easy.		A nice smokey sweet brew. Not the most bockish dopplebock that I have had but the smoke makes the beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"11.2oz bottle into pils glass.	A: Strong and steady stream of carbonation. White head retreats quick and left is a small, and foamy layer. Body is a crisp golden yellow.	S: Nice bready aroma, with a nice interplay of hops and malts. 	T/M: The all around flavors make this a nice and complex lager. Great malty off flavors. On the front there is a crisp welcoming from the mouthfeel of sharp hops. The overall body is light, but holds long character.	D: This is a nice session lager, and a nice imported choice. Nothing crazy going on but could fall back to this one.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle poured into pilsner flute		A - Pours a light orange color with a good one inch head that is slightly off white. Cathedral lacing is very nice.		S - Lots of hoppy pine flavor with some good citrus accompaniment. Slight grapefruit scent. A bit of caramel sugar to balance the bitter hops.		T - Starts with a touch of caramel sweetness before the bitter, flavorful hop explosion. Pine dominates, but grapefruit contributes. Very bitter and dry finish.		M - Very dry and bitter. Mild carbonation with a medium body. A bit chalky.		D - More piney and dry than many DIPA's, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Kindof one-dimensional though. Decent alcohol content. The flavor doesn't get too old after 12 oz, but a bomber might be a chore to finish.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Deep reddish purple. Nice fluffy head, with decent lacing. Head last's through out.		S: Ton's of tart and sweet raspberries. Some creamy notes show up behind the raspberry. A nice whiff of funk as well.		T: Upon first tasting you definetely get the tart raspberry, followed immediatley by sweet raspberries. There is some breadiness and a little funk in the taste. This is a fine tasting beer.		M:Fluffy/Chewy. Smooth and refreshing for a 9.5 abv brew. It really finishes great.		O: For a style that is growing on me this beer is definetely tops. This should be a must try on anyone's list who enjoy's or is looking to explore fruit beers.";;;;;;;;;;

"This was traded with a kind BA, in person during DLD 08. Unfortunately, I do not know his avatar.	Pappy Van Winkle barrel.		Nearly impenetrable black, frothy light tan head that dissipates rather fast, but leaves a lot of lacing on the sides of the glass. 	Aroma is a very nice, well balanced and complex mixture of vanilla, oak, bourbon, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and smoke. Not overly smoked as some have mentioned, but keep in mind I am a big fan of smoked beers, so it is never too much.	Medium bodied, a bit thinner than I would have liked, this being the only significant flaw, but not a major one.	Similar to the aroma, the flavors are a very nice, complex blend of bourbon, oakiness, roasted malts, vanilla, chocolate. 	A marked improvement over the original version, with a bit more body would make a spectacular beer. Too bad this specific barrel will not come around anymore.";;;;;;;;;;
"Filled my growler today with this amazing brew. According to Paul @ Calapooia, it's basically the RiverDog ESB, but aged in bourbon barrels that had previously held KringleKrack. 		From the growler it poured into my pint glass a hazy copper color, with a thick creamy head, good retention, heavy lacing. The aroma is amazing! Sweet bourboney(sp?) aroma, along with just the right amount of hops and a hefty malt sweetness. Taste is very true to style, lots of english style hops present. Very balanced flavor. Mouthfeel is very smooth and buttery. Drinkability? Very good. All the flavors and aroma go together so well, and the low abv make this a VERY sessionable brew. I could drink this all day long.";;;;;;;;;;
this is a benchmark pilsner. billowy, white two finger head that leaves a fair amount of lacing. it has a medium yellow color and is very effervescent. urquell smells a touch grainy and grassy. it tastes spicy, bitter, and sweet. this is one of the most drinkable beers around.;;;;;;;;;;
"A slightly hazy golden color with virtually no head. Very minor lacing.		A strong sweet citrus of apples, peaches, pears, and spices. Very pleasing.		Hops are a wonderful eclectic blend presenting a sudden blast of floral flavors and a somewhat toned down bitter spice. However, bitter flavor is perfectly balanced by a moderate malt backbone.		Mouthfeel is terrific - a viscous, thick bodied assault!		Drinkability is good too. Carbonation is not overwhelming by any means and the burning alcohol present in many hopped-up IPAs is pleasingly absent.		I certainly can't find much negative about this blend. I suppose the appearance is its weak point and I prefer a slightly more bitter flavor in an Imperial. Overall, an excellent brew.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a reddish orange body which has fine particulate suspended in it, kinda cool looking. Head is minimal which is what I would expect of the style and abv.		Wow what a nose on this one! Big bourbon, vanilla, candied orange, oak.		A carbon copy of the nose. The most interesting thing about the flavors on this one is how little sweetness there is which totally defies logic between the fact that it's a wheatwine and it was aged in maple syrup barrels.		Syrupy and viscous body with light and soft carbonation.		This is a very complex and unique beer. I'm amazed at how dry it finishes. Definitely a one done due to abv but nicely done Founder's.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz (undated) bottle into a pint glass.		I really like the way this beer looks. It's a murky, chestnut brown with amber highlights. A 1 & 1/2 finger light cream head with a cinnamon colored swirl of sediment that rises to the top makes me wonder what I've gotten myself into. The head settles quickly, leaving mild lacing behind.		The nose is very nice. A very buttery toffee aroma hits first, along with a sweetness. Seems like a candied fig or date. As the beer warms, I pick up some smoky wood tones.		On the tongue, I'm tasting a sweet caramel/toffee, along with butter rum. The oak comes out a little more here as well. A decent hop balance here also, along with a nice warming alcohol kick.		For me, the mouthfeel is outstanding. Very smooth and creamy, medium full body with low carbonation. The hops are mild, but enough to provide just a little bite, and the finish is sweet and sticky.		I don't have much experience with this style, but I like this beer a lot. Layers of interesting flavors. I wouldn't expect anything less from Founders.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Pours a fairly clear deep red-brown color (mahogany) with a finger of off-white head. The head faded fairly quickly to a nice ring on the glass and laced very nicely.		S - Very powerful and deep smokey (bourbon) aroma. Also some sweet elements from vanilla and carmel notes. There is also booze in the nose. Excellent aroma.		T - Starts off with some sweet carmel malts and a touch of the smokiness building in the background. Also the vanilla is also mixed in. In the middle the smoky flavor really jumps out. The finish has some more of the smokey/bourbon taste, the sweet malts, some dark fruit flavors, and some booze flavor, which all blend together and linger for a while. Excellent balance in the flavor.		M - Medium to medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Almost a bit think and creamy without being too viscous. The smokiness really coasts the mouth well. There is some nice alcohol sting on the tongue also.		D - Fairly drinkable. Knocking in at a relatively high 10.20 % abv, this is a fairly heavy beer and is best sipped. That being said, the booze flavors stay in check for high level and the flavor is just amazingly well balanced and complex. Excellent beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"wow, im impressed. this could be a stand by for me. i wish the taste had a bit more of the smell in it but the ships dont sing for alaska.		appearance - coal black and looking nice and thick on the pour. mocha colored head. almost two inches on a not so gentle pour. great lacing, sticking to the side of the glass as i drink.		smell - lots of vanilla, and really nice vanilla at that. oats and chocolate, dark chocolate that is. some other malts.		taste - vanilla is there, but not as nicely. oats come in stronger. chocolate is thin and other malts play bigger this round.		mouthfeel - a bit thin for an imperial oatmeal in my opinion. carbonation is great. this is the biggest let down of the almost perfect drink for me.";;;;;;;;;;
Appearance: clear golden yellow with some light orange colors mixing in. Spotty lace develops during the session.;;Smell: malt sweetness is all you can detect.;;Taste: thin malt profile with some grass and hints of fruit sweetness. Little bitterness. ;;Mouthfeel: lightly crisp from start to finish. Very short aftertaste. Lighter side of a mdeium bodied beer. ;;Drinkability: easy to quaff because it is thinner than other oktoberfests. But this beer doesn't excite you to drink more than one or two.;;
"Pours amber red with a medium sized whiteish head and little lacing. Fairy strong aroma of hoppy citrus and faint rye malt. 		Tastes of malty rye and spices up front that quickly melds into a nice hop bitterness with a nice creamy body. Strong aftertaste of rye, hops, and pine. 		I found this to be quite drinkable and really enjoyed the quick transition on the palate from this one, as it made it for a quite interesting and ejoyable beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"OK, so this was my first wheatwine tasting so it was hard to have anything to compare it to, but either way it was a great beer, not that I expected any different from Founders.	A-A hazy golden orange, light head, with legs	S-Fruity light oaky bourbon smell	T-Wow! definite malt upfront, with some fruit, sizurp, bourbon flavor on the end of the palate, a hint of hop, just barely.	M-Med-Full bodied, carbonation was a medium, made the beer quite refreshing.	D-The only hint of the high ABV was during exhalations after the first few sips, but dang it was good. 		I wish this was readily available later in the year, I would love sucking this down out on the screened porch all spring and summer long.	Slainte";;;;;;;;;;
"22 oz bottle, 8.6% abv. Pours a nice ruby color. Thin white head disappears immediately. A couple spots of lace. 		A nice ginger and cinnamon aroma. Some caramel malt. Very nice spices here. 		Caramel malt up front. Fair amount of sweetness. Long lingering gingerbread flavor. Some cinnamon sugar flavor with a bit of floral hop bitterness at the end. Very nice. 		Medium body, good carbonation. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. This has a very nice Christmas cookie feel to it.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.		A - Pours a dark brown with a thin tan head. Some slight lacing left on the glass.		S - Malty, bread, slight hops.		T - Bitter chocolate, heavy roasted malts.		D - Low carbonation, heavier body, some hop bitterness.		O - Sweeter, but different. Malty with some hidden hop bitterness.";;;;;;;;;;
"oh man, seeing that A+ average is daunting to start a review! i hope my tastes can manage such high standards! (only kidding)		im usually not crazy about reviewing the beers that i drink, i enjoy them much more when i simply take my time, and pay attention as i please. but after sipping this for over an hour (a couple bottles) i feel compelled to write something about it.		its 2009 vintage		a. super dark, barely a dark red tinge around the edge of the glass when held up to light. a rich dark brown head is agitated with the pour and raises between one and two fingers width. settles gently with a thin line of lace and maintains a partial head through the entire session. in general, it looks very very appealing as a stout, the heaviness though is slightly unappealing, in terms of the weight of the head and its inability to persist. it gets sucked into the dark depths of the brew. ominous.		s. smell is overall bourbony, but very intricately composed of sweet chocolatey and malty fringes. its not alcohol im smelling, its bourbon barrels. the chocolate vibe is more of an atmosphere surrounding the more pungent bourbon aroma. 		t. i like the use of the bitterness here, it attacks bitterly at first. the bitterness opens the door so to speak for the bourbon to introduce itself midpalate. the end is very gentle, simple, fulfilling chocolate. lingering aftertaste is coffee grounds and faint reminiscence of the alcohol and barrel and toasted baked goods. really nice.		m. very smooth at first, silky. then the carbonation pops up and settles dry, but not too dry, but it leaves a heavy coating of KBS in its wake.		d. very very very very lots of ""very""'s drinkable. its just overall so enjoyable and pleasant that there's no trouble at all taking down a couple bottles, as im doing. there's nothing difficult about it, its pleasant (instead of pungent, strong, intense...), and to me, that's the main appeal.";;;;;;;;;;
"Draft at Gourmet Haus Staudt in Redwood City, served in a stein.		A - Very dark brown in color with a fairly large off-white head.		S - Caramel, roast, and dark fruits. Somewhat sweet.		T - Lots of caramel malt, chocolate, roast, molasses, toffee, raisins and other dark fruits. Sweet but not overly so for the style, and well-balanced.		M - Palate medium-full and very smooth.		D - This was a surprisingly awesome doppelbock and never got to be too much. Drinkability was good.";;;;;;;;;;
Got a can of Caldera Pale Ale from a neighbor that collects cans, but did not really like the beer. You have to love a nice pale ale in a can. The beer is a cloudy yellow with a nice head that fell after a couple of minutes. The smell is very malty for a APA and has a nice hint of floral hops. The taste is very well balance between malt and hops. Not overly bitter or hoppy, but right on for a pale ale. This a a very good interpretation of the style and unique with the nice malt presence. Mouthfeel is on the medium side and the drinkability is good a well. This woould make a very good session beer if it were regularly available to me. I would definitely recommend this beer if you are looking for an above average pale ale.;;;;;;;;;;
"A bottle from '09		A-Deep rich black, not much head but what is there is a deep brown. It wants to leave some lacing behind but just can't.		S-Mainly chocolate, some roasted malt and even some alcohol.		T-Roasted malt. More coffee than in the nose. Chocolate is present. Even going on three years old bitterness is present. Coffee and chocolate blend well together.		M-Medium bodied, thick but not much carbonation.		O-A wonderful beer, now I'm going to have to hunt down a fresh version of this beer in January.";;;;;;;;;;
"Had this on tap at a special tasting.		A- Pours a deep black color with a thin mocha head that leaves some mild lacing.		S- Huge aroma of roasted malt and bourbon. Vanilla bean and oak scents blast through and can be smelled even across the room!		T- Big rush of bourbon initially which mellows into a combination of vanilla, oak, and bittersweet chocolate flavors. Roasted malt and coffee in the finish. The bourbon and alcohol are both apparent but not bothersome. 		M- Big and full bodied. Low carbonation with a lingering roasted/vanilla bourbon aftertaste.		D- Overall a huge brew with a nice bourbon flavor that wasn't over done.";;;;;;;;;;
Drank a bottle of this, dated from December, decanted into my KBS glass (holla!). Pours an opaque brownish-black. The slightest hint of head. Head is off-white. Aromas of coffee and chocolate. Tastes of espresso, dark chocolate. Strong malty center with a bitter finish (again the dark chocolate). Medium thickness to it. This is an excellent drinkable porter. Dynamic aromas and flavors, without that hard, watery bitterness that comes with a lot of porters.;;;;;;;;;;
"Paid $1.70 for a single at Ludlow Wines in Clifton...		The beer pours a clear golden base, decent sized head, good retention and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is banana heavy with other notes of wheat and clove/cardamom.		The taste is refreshing during the summer-time, low carbonation, very crisp with little aftertaste; tastes just like it smells. Excellent feeling in the mouth and yes, session, a great session beer!		Final Thought: Solid offering as usual from Stoudt's, but I was hoping they would try an mimic a Bavarian hefeweizen over this unique brew... oh well, it works!";;;;;;;;;;
A - Pours a cloudy dark yellow with hints of gold. Got about a half inch of head. Retention was good. Lacing was good.;;S - Primary aroma is citrus hops. That is followed by a combonation of citrus hops and citrus hops. The smell is also close to that of opening up a bag of fresh hops. In the background there is also a honey aroma.;;T - There is an abundant citrus hop flavor balanced with a good bitterness. The malt base is a little thin giving the hops a big upper hand in the flavor (it is an APA so I can't fault it in the respect). There is a nice touch of alcohol in the distant background of the flavor profile. ;;M - This one is medium bodied with pretty good carbonation. Finishes really bitter and dry. ;;D - This is a good beer that is very drinkable. The big flavor assaults the taste buds so my limit would be one per sitting.;;
"black as night with no head other than a thin tan ring around the edge.	the aroma contains big time burnt coffee/espresso. it's also got components of baking chocolate, vanilla, caramel, bourbon, molasses and a hint of black licorice.	the taste is awesomely rich and luxurious. creamy espresso, with bitter chocolate, vanilla, and caramel drizzle. bourbon behind that and in the aftertaste. it's got a charred oaky character that just completely puts this over the top. fantastic.	the mouth feel is very full and smooth as hell... like butter. active, but delicate carbonation.	drinkability isn't perfect, booze and magnitude of flavor contribute to that, but it's pretty near perfect.	this beer is amazing, period. it sets a benchmark for the very deffinition of barrel aged double stout. well worth the price in my opinion. i'm a bit of a beer slut, but i would keep this in my fridge at all times if i could.";;;;;;;;;;
"355ml bottle bought online from Mybrewerytap.com...		Poured jet black - nothing gets through even when held up to the light. Dark dirty brown head poured thick and foamy then faded to nice thickish covering... very faint lacing...		Aroma - Big blast of strong espresso coffee and toasted malts, some milk chocolate, oats, light blackcurrent/blackberry notes, cocoa, leathery, woody, some faint vanilla traces, light spicy hops, burnt sugar...		Taste - Lots of creamy chocolate and rich dark coffee to the fore, roasted malts, faint smokey notes, some liquorice, some peppery hops, nutty, light molasses sweetness..		Feel - Very smooth and creamy with just a little sharpness after... full bodied... very drinkable for 8.3%		Overall - An outstanding brew and up with the best of the Americans impy stouts...";;;;;;;;;;
A completely black beer with a thin mocha head. BORIS is a thick, almost to the point of sludgy beer with a roasted malt taste with a noticeable but background hop presences. The oatmeal comes into play as a slight cookie taste. Overall it's a great beer that worthy of a try.;;;;;;;;;;
A translucent golden color, not much head on the top of the pour, gives way to slight lacing as it is consumed. A piney and citrusy smell is given off. I taste grapefruit and other citrus notes. It has a medium mouthfeel with a perfect amount of carbonation. I could drink several of these in one sitting, although with the high abv, not the best idea. One of my favorite dipa's along with Hopslam. This one is not as sweet though.;;;;;;;;;;
"GLASS: Snifter	TEMP: Cellared @ approx 45 degrees		Dark copper colored liquid with light highlights of dark ruby. Almost one-fingers worth of tan foam forms the head. It recedes to a very thin surface covering, rather quickly. Lacing is spotty, but rather sticky.		Huge maltiness, which is expected, what with the purported 10 different kinds of malt used to brew this one. Big yeasty breadiness, also.	The nose is kind of minimal, actually, although it smells very delicious.		Big, bready, biscuity flavors dominate. Large presence of toasted and roasted malts. A nice amount of smoke/char flavor comes through also. Very light hints of caramel and brown sugar.	This is a much drier scotch ale than I expected. Not nearly the amount of swetness that I generally associate with the style. It's deliciously different.		Solid medium bodied brew. Low to medium levels of carbonation. Very smooth, but could use some more creaminess.		A very nice and drinkable bottle, here. The ABV may keep it out of session range, but it's still delicious and goes down easy.";;;;;;;;;;
"A- A vibrant creamy amber with a misty head but persistent lacing 		S Winey almost syrupy sweet aroma. Also, floral possibly plum hints.		T- Amidst the myriad of flavor chocolate and honey notes. Spicy hints hit the edge of your tongue. 		M- Fluffy and creamy. The alcohol makes itself know with a slow constant burn. 		D- Overall this was a very enjoyable ale. the mouthfeel was the most interesting part of this beer. Also, the alcohol can sneak up on you if you have a few of these.";;;;;;;;;;
Jupiter has one of the best IPAs I've had in my day. At the bar there in Berkeley, the bartender was excellent in making recommendations and this one was well taken. It poured a deep red color and was obviously thick with hops. It had a small creamy head that stayed throughout the beverage's existence in my glass (which was short lived). The taste was amazing, the hop explosion was perfect and didn't just overpower everything else about the power. I highly recommend both Jupiter and this beer (as well as the redspot).;;;;;;;;;;
"Split a bottle with my roommate tonight. His first time and I think he hated it. Doesn't like stouts though.		A- Poured into a pint glass. Quater inch head that slowly went away after a short while leading to a nice lacing around the sides of the glass. Pours pitch black very much like motor oil.	S- Smells of burnt coffee and bourbon undertones. Also, a strong soy sauce smell which kind of makes my mouth water for some reason.	T- Hints of bourbon and oak. Big stout taste which the roasted malts come through and the coffee taste with this one. Little chocolate taste that lingers after it goes down.	M- Heavy! Coats the tounge nicely in a bourbon coffee overload. Little bit more chewy than most stouts I had.	D- This is a beer that I can enjoy when I'm looking for something different than what I have been drinking. 		All in all Founder's never ceases to amaze me with their beers. My roommate on the other hand never ceases to amaze me with his chugging skills when he doesn't like a beer.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter;;A- Pours dark raisiny brown with a light golden hue. Thin layer of head dissipates and forms large bubbles on the sides of the glass. Nice lacing of small mocha colored bubbles.;;S- Smells of sweet bourbon and coffee beans. Roasted chocolate hints with a distinct oak finish.;;T- Wow....this is perfect in every way. Sweet bourbon up front followed by coffee notes. Tastes just like it smells and that is delicious. One of the most well-balanced beers I've ever had or will ever have.;;M- Thick with little carbonation. Slightly bitter oak finish which lingers beautifully on the palate. ;;D- Amazing for a barrel-aged beer. So smooth and delicious. This one is right at the top of the list
"Appearance - Poured a very clear, apple juice shade of orangish-yellow. Head is 1/4 inch, and fades rather quickly, with none remaining after 5 minutes.		Smell - Wow. The sweetness of the malt and the fruity-bitterness of the hops meld deliciously. No alcohol or estery smell - just almost want to smell it all night. 		Taste - The sweetness of the malt shines through, offset by a little bitterness and tons of lingering hops aftertaste, but very little bitterness remaining, unlike several DIPA's I've had.		Mouthfeel - Smooth, slightly oily. Very pleasant to swirl around. Good carbonation, but not overly so to the point of being fizzy.		Drinkability - AT 10% ABV, definitely one to enjoy slowly, which I don't find difficult. Trying to down this too fast is almost impossible, as I enjoy every sip just as is. Wish it would last even longer, but an extremely enjoyable beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Deep mahogany black cola color. Decent sized beige-ivory, foamy head. Disappears fast and leaves very minimal lacing.		S - Sweet caramel and chocolate malt with a bit of dark sugar. The next whiff is full of spiced dark fruit (good amount of plum and grape).		T - Good amount of roasted and chocolate malt with a hint of caramel. Good amount of tea and herbal flavors. Some dark fruitiness (plum, dark cherry, and raisin) as well as a bit of citrus (mostly orange but there was a slight hint of grapefruit). Fair amount of spice (cinnamon and nutmeg). Has a bit of a tangy flavor overall, but has a slight spiced and sweetness.		M - Medium body and low carbonation. Smooth and slightly watery.		D - Pretty drinkable. Smooth and easy to drink. Somewhat tangy, spiced, and sweet. A little watery.		Notes: Kind of a light. Not a bad beer, somewhat like a light porter with a fruity tanginess. Probably not all that memorable of a beer but decent tasting beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"This spot on rendition of the style makes a virtue of simplicity. It's very crisp and clean, with a slight bit of hops bitterness. The malt tastes fresh and provides an excellent example of the classic pils flavor, with a tinge of grainy sweetness. Gold Lager is an unassuming brew that doesn't seek to dazzle--hey, look at it sitting in your glass, with so few carbonation bubbles and so little head or lacing--it's no show off.		Brewing a session lager like this consistently and in large enough quantities to distribute takes serious brewing kung-fu. We talk so much on this site about beers that convert macro drinkers into craft drinkers, well Stoudt's helles is somewhat of the opposite--a beer to convert drinkers of quintuple IPAs, 157% ABV barleywines, beers brewed with plutonium, and so on to the lovely world of sessionable gold lagers.";;;;;;;;;;
"My 100th review!	12oz bottle poured into a snifter.	2011 Vintage	Thanks to Jarpo for hooking me up with a couple of these bad boys in a trade! As you can imagine, I am pretty excited to get to try this beer with all the hype surrounding it. Lets see if it lives up to it.		A: Jet black color pours from the bottle as a brown milk chocolate head rises up. The head alone makes this thing look delicious. The retention is good as the head settles to a thin film across the top and a solid ring around the glass. Lacing is incredible... I don't think I have actually seen exceptional lacing until this beer.		S: I popped this one open when it was still fairly cold and the first few sniffs were a bit muted. Still you could smell dark and milk chocolate and a slight hop aroma. As it warmed the bourbon poked its head out a bit more. A slight herbal hop aroma to it.		T: Tasted it while it was still fairly cold as well. Tons of milk chocolate and coffee. The chocolate is pretty awesome and the coffee flavors accent it well. As the beer warmed the flavor started to feature more of the bourbon barrels. The taste is great, there is no way around it, but I don't think it is nearly as complex as some of the other stouts I've had (Abyss comes to mind)		M: Thick creamy and chewy feel here. Plenty of carbonation to really make the flavors pop.		Notes: Definitely an incredible beer. I will gladly drink more whenever I can but its ""hype"" might make it a little higher up on the trading totem poll than I'd want to go. Luckily I had a generous trader for this round. I'm definitely excited to age this awhile and see what happens to it!";;;;;;;;;;
"Another growler shared by Eric - cheers!		Rich golden pour with a decent sized white head that diminished to a light film, but did leave some lace. Pine resins and citrus in the aroma with an underlying sweetness. Very decent flavour, and good balance - tangerine and grapefruit mix in with a touch of pine, and are married to a strong sweet malt background. The alcohol is expertly hidden in this beer. While it has all the amped up flavours of an imperial (more hops and more malt), it drinks like a session beer, which is dangerous! Smooth and clean mouthfeel with low carbonation.		Great stuff.";;;;;;;;;;
"Abbey Belgian-style DIPA pours a light gold color. It's shockingly clear and has an interesting copper tint to it. Where's the haze? I like haze in my Belgian IPAs. *sighs* A slightly off-white head tops it off nicely. It's nearly three fingers tall and takes quite a while to completely dissipate. Lacing was impressive. Very sticky and thick. Good overall. 		The nose is interesting. It's good, but isn't Belgian-esque enough. Hops are at the forefront and are mostly citric in character. Grapefruit and orange scents are strong. There's a little pine there, but citrus notes mostly dominate. That part is good. Very good. The downside here is that there's very little Belgian yeast. I hope that's not true in the flavor. Pale malts are noted. There's a hint of sweet caramel, but not much. Alcohol doesn't seem too strong. I wouldn't have guessed 8.5%. It smells good, but for the style, it's pretty average. Above average seems fair.		The flavor profile is everything the nose suggested. Hops are very much the focal point of this beer. They have a nice citrusy flavor. Grapefruit and orange flavors are noted throughout. There's a touch of pine to round it out. Pale and caramel malts give it a really nice base, though the pale variety is much more apparent. I like those aspects of it. There's maybe a hint of Belgian yeast here, but not a great deal. A true Belgian IPA needs a lot more of that flavor. To be fair, this is a good beer. I like the flavor pretty well. But, for a Belgian IPA, it's just average. There's a spicy component to it that emerges late. It's subtle and I can't identify the individual spices. Alcohol is more prominent in flavor, but is blended well. Seems on par for an 8.5% abv beer. It finishes dry and a little bitter.		The body here is medium and it is rather smooth. It leans heavy with a little warming. Carbonation is light. It's nearly creamy, but not quite there. Drinkability is good. The overall flavor, despite my criticisms, is good. This is an enjoyable beer. It goes down easy and isn't too big in stature.		Abbey Belgian-style DIPA is an interesting beer. I like Hoppin' Frog's decision to leap into the Belgian territory. But, the final result is simply above average. There's just not enough of a ""Belgian"" character to it. A stronger Belgian yeast presence would right the ship. If you ignore the style classification, it is good beer. Perhaps very good. I've really enjoyed the bottle. Definitely pick one up if you run across it. It's an enjoyable beer, but not a top tier Belgian IPA.";;;;;;;;;;
"This lively, complex, yet smooth ale is a lot like a lighter, more lively and flowery version of Old Peculier. 		Very dark red brown, it has a big, dense tan head and leaves some lace. 		The aroma is rich, toasty and caramelly with light earthiness. 		The taste is toasty and lightlyearthy with hints of chocolate, dark caramel, coffee, slightly flowery with a bitter sweet finish.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured a muddy black with nice caramel head. Smells of coffee and chocolate. The taste is exceptional with a slight bitter after taste. The bittertness is not overpowering just enough to make you know its there. Not a very dry stout either. It didn't leavneeding a drink to wet my whistle, which is a nice feel from a stout. For a 8+ ABV it hides it well, more in the smell than in the tatse. This is one of the better Stouts I have ever had. Nice job, Founders!;;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle opened by nickd717. Thanks, Nick.		Dark chocolate brown, close to opaque. A tan head retains fairly well.		Pretty nice aroma, chocolatey and nutty with a twang of acidic roast.		Roasty and nutty on the palate, reminiscent of roasted peanuts. Hints of licorice with a chocolate and coffee finish. The body is a tad thin, but I can't fault it too much for that, it's quite good overall.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle served at Maccaroni Grill in East Hanover...	From the bottle, poured into a frosty serving glass a light-copper, sunny amber appearance with no head at all and no lacing either...	Bland, watered-down, corny and grainy taste - very light, crisp, and refereshing with hardly any aroma present at all save for some grains and a light-amber essence...	This beer went down very easily - almost akin to water, and thanks to the low 4.4% ABV, this one would make a decent session beer that is easy to drink, refreshing, although somewhat lacking in the flavor and light mouthfeel department...	Decent, but nothing above-and-beyond...";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Deep amber, less than half a finger slightly off white head. Head stays around for a bit. Lots of carbonation rising in the glass. Very nice looking appearance.		S - Sweet smelling, floral hops, a bit of pine, some citrus as well. Malts balance out the aroma, not typical to an IPA. Some sweet caramel aromas.		T - Still very malt-dominated for an IPA. Caramel and light-roasted malts are the backbone with a hint of chocolate... weird. I get mostly bitterness from the hops, not really any flavor. If there is a flavor there and I'm not searching for it, it would be some earthly floral hops. 		M - Medium bodied, great carbonation. Finish is slightly dry and bitter with some residual sweetness from the malts. Hints of the floral hops show up well after the sip is finished.		D - Very good drinkability. Not too high of an ABV, but alcohol still isn't noticeable. Finish makes me want to go back for more. Despite the beer not being as hoppy as expected, it's still very good. I may be under-rating it due to my expectations from west coast IPAs, but I could be wrong.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours with a slightly cloudy pale yellow body topped by a medium thick head with lots of lacing. Sweet and citrusy hop aroma with very slight malt accents. Slightly sweet but mostly bitter citrusy hop flavor with piney notes and a very slight malt accent. the finish is bitter and piney. Medium bodied and smooth with a slight dryness. Out of the selection on hand, this is the only beer worth coming back for.;;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz. bottle dated 2/22/10 poured into a snifter		A- Black with a huge tan head.		S- Chocolate, roasted coffee, roasted malts, and a hint of caramel and hops.		T- Rich, complex, and balanced. A great blend of roasted coffee and chocolate with a great malt backbone, and had a nice bitter bit in the finish.		M- Thick, creamy, and silky smooth.		D- This is a great beer, one of the best I have had. With how big the taste is I would really only have one as a dessert, I could not drink more than one in a sitting. I got this in a Founders variety pack with Centennial IPA, Dirty Bastard, and Red's Rye PA, and this is the best out of the four.";;;;;;;;;;
Beautiful bright amber color with a lacy head.  The aroma presented an abundance of buttery character.  The first taste uncovers a slight malty sweetness which is complimented toward the middle and bottom of the glass by a grassy tea-like hoppiness.  I have never had its like.  This is a very nice brew to finish the night with.  Not too filling after a meal and without a strong lingering finish.;;;;;;;;;;
A buddy of mine picked this up for me, I've never ben able to find it. Pours like 10w40, it is just BLACK, smell is alcohol at first, it's overpowering almost, it smells like whiskey hence the aging. Taste is very whiskey heavy, it doesn't really taste like a normal stout, but that is what makes it so special. Mouthfeel is very thick, one of the thickest beers I've ever had.;;;;;;;;;;
"Got this one in my first trade a while back. Thanks again Steve for popping my cherry! This bottle is from 2009 and poured into a tulip. The pour is pitch black with about three fingers of creamy looking mocha colored head that leaves sticking lacing along the side. The first smell into this one is full of dark fruits right away. Another dive in reveals a ton of chocolate aromas with hints of coarsely ground coffee. The aroma is spot on for this, everything I could want from an imperial stout; coffee, chocolate, dark fruits and good roasted malts. The taste mirrors the aroma perfectly. It starts with dark fruits and undertones of chocolate and coffee finish nicely. Again, everything I could want. The mouthfeel seems a bit light and the abv peers through ever so slightly. However, the drinkability is tough to beat for the style.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle and served in my NB Worthy glass:	A - Completely opaque with a small but mostly lasting tan head and good lace.	 	S - The aroma has a major roasted malt overtone with barley, chocolate, black patent malts in play supported by some prune, espresso, licorice, earthy yeast ester, and a a quick vapour of fresh hops. 		T -The taste has an explosion of chocolate fudge at first then the oats add a depthness. A smoky and wood bark character show in midstream. The finish displays a note of the alcohol content and some hop bitterness. 	M - The mouth feel is lush but not still, oily and smooth except for the alcohol bite towards the end. 		D - A very good Impy from this up and coming brewery. I wish I had more than one bottle. Another road trip is in order methinks.";;;;;;;;;;
"Hurray! Another long wanted brew I was able to secure multiple pous of at GToM 2009.		A-Golden copper/orange with a thin off-white head that reduced to a ring and left spotty lace.		S-Dank grapefruit, lemon, vanilla, oak and butterscotch. Ends with a floral pop and some malty sweetness.		T-Initial caramel malt sweetness that is quickly augmented with a plethora of flavours to include, dry oak, orange, grapefruit, herbalness, vanilla, mango and cinnamon?.		M-Medium bodied with a nice creamy smoothness and all of the lingering flavours one would expect from such a complex brew.		D-Well hidden alcohol, a boat load of flavours, superbly smooth and tasty! 		Head starts spinning round, you fall down to the ground. Feel your body heave, Death's hands starts to weave!";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a can into a Sam Adams PP glass. Pours an cloudy yellow with a one finger, foamy white head, which dissipates very quickly. Some nice lacing going down the glass.		Smells of caramel malts and not picking up much of the hops in the nose but my sense of smell at the moment is not the best.		At first taste I get a little hop bitterness followed by caramel with a big piney, resinous hop finish. This is a very tasty IPA.		Medium bodied with very bold flavors. This beer leaves behind that resinous, piney hop flavor after the beer has been swallowed.		I really like this beer. It is most certainly a hop lovers delight. It's fairly low ABV could allow one to drink down a few of these in one sitting. However, the price could limit the number of times I try this, at over 16$ for a sixer.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz can. 		Poured a medium amber color with an averagd sized off white head. Aromas of pine, earthy, floral, and citrus. Tastes of pine, citrus, and some caramel. Nice grapefruit bitter finish. A vert nice IPA and from a can too!		Notes from: 09/14/07.";;;;;;;;;;
Enjoyed on-tap at the brewpub. Chocolate,stouty roast and barrel aroma. Dark colour with off-white head, lacing. A bitterness, chocolate coffee. A little tartness, bit you must care something for coffee. Above average creamy mouthfeel. Woodiness, lots of complexity. Right up there as a RIS.;;;;;;;;;;
"At Al's of Hampden. Last night and again this afternoon. Served in a mini snifter both times. 11 ounces of glory.		A: The stout is pitch black, an encompassing morass of depth, really a beauty to look at. The bottle pour has left only the faintest band of dark head behind, The viscous body has legs.		S: Sweet maple syrup paired with vanilla bourbon, coffee and roasted chocolate. Each aroma takes it time, gradually emerging as the stout warms. The maple is, by far, the most unique aspect, a rich sweetness cuts through the rest of the already-formidable imperial stout.		T: Imperialistic and coffee-drive, the first couple sips bring the coffee stout to the fore. The coffee buzz iz intoxicatingly good, coaxing the rest of the stout out. The bourbon and maple follow, bringing out the intensity of the stout. The bourbon lends vanilla and coconut before the maple comes through with a syrupy strength. That maple is strong and very dry, each sip left my mouth to deal with a dry sweetness that screamed out for more. The whole package, as strong as it is, just tastes right - a velvety smooth stout.		M: The swirling flavors, bourbon and maple and coffee and chocolate, come together like few other beers can. From the late-night neon din to a mid-day sit-down, CBS doesn't disappoint.		O: A beer like this deserves an addendum, an ""I'm with you in Rockland"" postscript. Each sip is so complex, so flavorful, that words can barely do it justice.";;;;;;;;;;
Appearance: minimal brown head with engine oil color and texture that could run a jet;;Smell: Nutty with bountiful malt notes;;Taste: lite hops on the front end with a powerful finish of malts and nuts;;MouthFeel: like olive oil even almost chewy;;Drinkability: repetitiously returnable ;;one of the best stouts out there a in a close race with the goose island night stalker
"Thanks to weeare138 for this growler shared with tenderbranson69, consumed from a duvel tulip. 		 A dark ruddy brown with translucent clarity and thick beige cap which leaves a film of spotty lace and settles to a ring of fine beads. The smell is loaded with lots of wood and caramel w/ vanilla and bourbon providing a strong ester and slight spice w/ gentle alcohol indicating a high gravity brew awaits. The smell has light maple and nutty toffee accents in the mix. The feel is thick and rich w/ substantial strength apparent w/ mildly sweet texture and semi-high bitterness w/ a lot of astringency. The alcohol has a slight drying effect as it finishes w/ moderate roastiness. 		 The flavor of the Scotch ale is strong and rich with a toffee quality w/ pine from the hops and lots of vanilla from the barrel. The taste is nutty with earthy flavor and mild woody taste like a vanilla toffee spice with a moderately strong bourbon flavor. There is a bitter presence that dominates w/ a caramel candy and bitter presence w/ more sweetness evident in the taste as it warms. I was overjoyed when Mike offered this growler to me -A wonderful oak and bourbon element presents itself so well w/ lots of roasted and candy-like notes yet strength is high in the flavor and feel. It fits the style well and has exceptional drinkability in my opinion. I was truly grateful for the gift -I almost drank a whole growler save for 2 pints.";;;;;;;;;;
"In a snifter		Poured a little too cold originally but once it warmed retained head when swirled. Lacing a bit weak. Clear golden body. Smells absolutely fantastic. Lemon and grapefruit provide sweet fruity aromas and a bit of alcohol comes through. Tastes wonderful: fruity and floral hoppiness, specifically lemony. Aftertaste is peppery and citrusy and overall refreshing. Pretty hot, however. Carbonation is a bit biting and just too prevalent. Body is about average. High hoppiness is a bit tough on the tongue, but the fact that this beer is so delicious sort of makes up for that.		Overall: This alcohol is just a bit too obvious in this one. However, it has great";;;;;;;;;;
"Presentation: 17oz. brown bottle with no ""bottled on"" or ""best by"" date; $2.19 from the Beverage Warehouse down near Culver City; small image of a horned, goat-like creature either drinking or going Kobe Bryant on what would be a two-foot tall beer on the label; forgive me, Kobe, for that last remark.		Appearance: Pours a dark, dark, chocolate brown; subtle ruby notes; fat, thick, mocha colored head; beautiful cascade effect upon the pour; moderate-to-heavy lacing; head retires after a minute or so.		Aroma: Heavy notes of chocolate, dark fruits and god knows what else -- my nose is something of a two-trick pony; slighty phenolic.		Taste: Holy sh*t. Thick, vibrant flavors of chocolate, raisins, cherries and rum; a firm, bitter roastiness pokes its head through in the finish; hearty, hearty warming sensation; rich, heavy body.		Notes: Sharing is for the weak. If you find this beer, take it from Mustard: horde it like the greedy pig that you are. The best porter I have ever had, by far.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a Nonic.		A: Hazy amber. A small cream cap is fairly dense and quickly falls to a patchwork film. Leaves no lace.		S: A healthy dose of grapefruit and lemon dominates. The rye is quite pronounced too. It adds a caraway seed like herbal twist to the mix.		T: Grapefruit, lemon and a touch of pine constitute the bitter flavors. The rye adds a slightly sour caraway bite to the mix. Biscuit flavors are present as well. Finishes with a lingering citrus bitterness.		M: The medium body is grainy and has about the right amount of fizz.		D: Not bad. I didn't really pick up the hemp, but the rye is rather pronounced.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a brilliantly clear pale gold with a bright white loose 1/8"" head. Fine visible carbonation at a moderate pace. Nce rings of dripping white lace.		The smell of this beer reminds me of breakfast at my in-laws lake cottage...smoked country ham with the edges a bit charred. Don't get me wrong, the scent isn't intense by any means, but it's the first element that hits the nostrils. Soft, clean malts act as a stage for this smoky seductress.		The flavors of the clean and bready malts taste somewhat sweet, but not overly sweet at all. The light (by Schlenkerla standards) smokiness is well-balanced and organic, not contrived or manufactured. The level of smoke in the nose translates evenly to the level in the flavor. The hops give this beer a nice crisp cleanliness as well as a dry texture to counterbalance the semi-sweet malt. 		Mouthfeel is heavenly. A bit oily with a silky feel. The carbonation is light, but still finely felt on the tongue. Between light and medium bodied with a light smokey and dry flavorful finish.		Drinkability is great. This type of beer can be enjoyed by the person who gravitates to this unique style. If paired with any pork or BBQ'ed flesh - it's a match made in heaven.		Overall a stellar beer and should be the standard by which all others (in this style) are judged - just by the malt & hop profile alone, (the smokiness is an added bonus). I've yet to be disappointed by any Bamberg breweries offerings. Now if I could just get Mahrs Brewing closer to my area.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle graciously placed in my mix-a-six from Abe's of Bethlehem, PA.		A- Very dark and heavy viscosity.... Very nice tan head with moderate foamy head.		S- Rich dark roasted coffee and bittersweet cocoa....		T- Very hearty and very nice espresso profile... not too sweet like similar porters.		M- Very rich and dense. 		D- This is a very top-notch porter in my book. i could drink these all night!";;;;;;;;;;
A nice creamy yellow beer with a thick white creamy head that leaves nice lacing and good retention. The nose is full of floral and citrus. Loads of grapefruit, orange zest, sticky pine. Lots of centennial hops, grassy and floral elements. The taste has a crisp cut with citrus notes and lime zest. Great IPA.;;;;;;;;;;
"2010 bottle acquired in a trade, served at 50F		Pours black with dark mocha head. Sparse lacing throughout.		Smell is oak, coffee, malt, cacao		Taste is oak and chocolate, some booze.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied, softened by the oak, heavy carbonation.		This is a good beer, but so overly burnt oaky, that it is tough to finish alone.";;;;;;;;;;
"Finally, the elusive Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout, well worth the wait. 		KBS poured a very, very dark, opaque brown with a half inch darkly tanned head the quickly faded to a slim, but elegant collar. 		The aroma was black coffee, rich dark chocolate and, I swear, light peanut butter; in that order. 		The taste was... hold on, I expected KBS to be over rated, and I expected to have a home state bias. It wasn't! And, I didn't. It was so good, I had to crack open a second one, and it was warm, no matter. Roasted coffee, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and yes, oh yes, alcohol. I do want to taste some hot alcohol in my bourbon barrel aged beers, or else why bother. KBS had IT. 		Mouth feel was full bodied, oily and perfectly (modestly) carbonated. 		Drinkability, this is my second one, I would love another. ABV be damned. 		OK, call me a homer, but this is good shit. Make this a year-rounder Founders! On a side note; this makes me want to try another of my cellared Expedition stouts and do a re-rate.";;;;;;;;;;
"Very nice aroma. Has a lot of malty/sugary scent, a bunch of fruity yeasty smells and then a huge dose of citrussy northwest hops. The more I smell it the more prominant the hops seem, but on first smell, I'm surprised the level of complexity.		Amber colored and very cloudy (I asked my bartender and it's unfiltered), Small but very persistant white head.		Flavor is pretty bitter right off. There's a good underlying malt backbone though that comes off as honey syrup. Lots of fruity esters from the yeast, I get peaches and apricot. Very hoppy flavor, citrus and biting, but it's really well balanced by the malt. There's a lingering aftertasted of grassy hops but it isn't toungue scraping, just a low level hop flavor that lasts a couple minutes.		Very full bodied with the carbonation on the light side.		I'm suddenly a big fan. It's a big beer without being overwhelming. It's hoppy and dry while maintaining some malty sweetness. Makes me want to explore this brewery's other offering ASAP.";;;;;;;;;;
"drank from a lager glass served from a bottle		a - superior - high carbonation means a thick, creamy, frothy head - as others here have said, you pour some, wait for the head to die down, and then pour the rest of the bottle. Head is very thick and creamy - you could almost eat it with a spoon. Golden color, with constant cascade of carbonation		s - fabulous! you can smell the hops as soon as you open the bottle		t - Phenomenal! As highly carbonated as the beer is, it's not overpowering. There are strong hoppy notes but you can still taste the malty sweetness.		m - Finishes strong - a great beer from start to finish. 		d - the perfect session beer. Complex, but easy to drink		This is the third beer from Founders Brewing I have tried, and as much as it pains this transplanted Buckeye to say, they make some damn good beer up there in Michigan! This beer is one of my new favorites!";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a golden color with one finger of light fluffy head and lots of carbonation.		Scent of hops dominate, strong oily delicious hops, sharp piny hops with a subtle citrus scent bringing the intense hop aroma to a balance slightly.		Taste of piny oily hops, with streaks of malts running through the mouth and enough of a citrus flavor to keep it all in line. Intense hops are wonderful and complimented very well.		Mouthfeel is light, but the sharp bitterness is the main attraction here, I love it.		Founders has crafted an excellent Pale Ale and I am very happy to have been able to try this one and I will certainly purchase it again. If this were available year round I would always have it in my fridge. Most definitely recommended.";;;;;;;;;;
"Had on tap at DLD, was the second to last person to get it before the keg was kicked. 		A-Dark, dark black. Some lacing is left.		S-Coffee chocolate, molasses and roasted malt.		T-So sweet! Chocolate, roasted malt and coffee. Some molasses and vanilla are apparent as well. Some bitterness in the finish. Great balance.		M-Thick and syrupy. Very smooth.		O-Wow. Going to DLD was worth it for this beer. I can't believe how easy drinking as smooth this great tasting beer is.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance -- Pours a hazy golden hue with a slim white head. Spotty lacing all the way down. Beautiful.		Smell -- Juicy citrus, peach and apricot, jasmine, pine resin, and caramel. 		Taste -- Big, bold hop flavors from the onset evoking pink grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, and pine resin. Hop bitterness is pronounced,Malting is exceptional with a base of caramel and freshly macerated drupes. Lingering flavors of grapefruit pith and peaches.		Mouthfeel -- Medium-bodied with nice carbonation - lively, but not at all harsh. Great stuff.		Drinkability -- Wow. This year's batch of Double Trouble is killing it! Having consumed fresh Hopslam for a week, this is definitely as good as its heralded Michiganian cousin, if not better. Lots of great juicy citrus, solid bitterness, and a caramel malt base that is really exceptional. Love it.";;;;;;;;;;
"A- Orange color, with a 1 finger white head. Looks really nice, expecially when held up to the light.		S- Faint pumpkin, Cinnamon		T- Malt, hint of pumpkin with caramel and cinnamon notes. Finishes clean.		M- Smooth, and not overpowering on the carbonation.		D- Easier to drink then other Pumpkin Ales I have tried. I think the lower ABV helps in that regard. Great when its cold, snowy around a fire.		I really like this, to me its pretty much the perfect pumpkin Ale. However the only thing I would change is the amount of actual Pumpkin flavor. It needs cranked up a notch!";;;;;;;;;;
The beer pours a brown color with a white head. The aroma is unmistakably rauchbier. I get a ton of smoke and ash along with some wheat. The flavor is smoke and wheat. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I enjoyed this beer, but I liked the roasted malt and dark fruit notes that I got from the Maerzen and Urbock more than the wheat notes that I get from this beer. This one was a little too one dimensional.;;;;;;;;;;
"It is very dark for a wheat beer, but looks nice. It is not black, as there is a hint of amber to it. The head was thick and stuck around for a chat. Damn it smells good. It combines two great food types into one: smoked meat and beer! Very strong. The taste is surprisingly mild at first, giving only hints of grain and smoke, but the aftertaste is where the flavors come out. Strong on the smoke and grainy malt flavors.	It could use a bit more carbonation for the mouth feel - it's almost watery at first. I could drink a lot of this stuff.";;;;;;;;;;
Heck Yes. Bottle 2007, Draught too actually. An awesome Scotch style ale. Dark amber, moderate carbonation, rich flavs. I prefer sipping this beer slower than most, as the 8%+ is evident (but not obnoxious). The caramelness and molassesness is in yo face on this one, so if you dig that you'll love this one.;;;;;;;;;;
"On-tap at Mahaffey's in Baltimore. Poured into a pint glass. 		Appearance: Lighter brownish orange-colored, creamy-looking white head. 		Smell: Hugely floral, big citrus and flowers. Along with some bready caramel malt aromas too. Certainly doesn't seem like a Doppelbock. 		Taste: Floral but balanced big hops with a good balance of sweetness and rind-like hops, along with some bready caramel and doughy malts. 		Mouthfeel: Fairly creamy for a bigger-bodied beer. Not too heavy, though, and good carbonation levels. 		Drinkability: I thought this was a Pale, and certainly not a Doppelbock. So does that take points off? I'm not sure, but I don't think so. Certainly the hoppiest version of the style I've had, but I like the risk and the differences pay off her.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured this from a bottle into a snifter. 		The deepest black you could imagine but still holding a very subtle hint of red in the center, and a reddish-brown, very thin head. 		Very distinct chocolate and malt smells, while not overpowering.		Very creamy, chocolate malt and oatmeal taste. 		Heavy but not over heavy feel. 		Overall one of the best stouts available. Creamy, dark, potent, and relaxing.";;;;;;;;;;
"Sweet zombie Jesus, I may have found The Grail of porters. 		I'm not going to do the typical appearance, taste, etc. review. I'm going to use this space to tout the greatness of this beer.		Ok, I'll give a little bit of the raw info that you people crave. It's pretty to look at, smells remarkable and tastes like a dream. It's sweet and delicious, and goddamnit, I want more!		This stuff really only has a couple of flaws. First and foremost, the 8.3% alcohol keeps it from being sessionable. Secondly, it's such a rich beer that one is really all that you need. Other than that, this is the porter that all other porters wish that they could be. Drink it. Love it. And do it with gusto, folks. At $2.99 for a 500 ml bottle, it's the cheapest ticket to heaven that you'll ever buy.";;;;;;;;;;
"From bottle into pint glass.		A: Orange ambery, honey colored. A bit translucent. No head or much lacing.		S: very cinnamon, nutmeg and just spicy. More sweet potato than pumpkin. Reminds me of walking Michael's.		T: Very spicy! Cinnamon is very strong. Pumpkin is kinda hangin around but not the most prominent. I like it.		MF: eh.		OA: I really liked this, want more! Haven't found a lot of pumkins I like this one was over the top Stallone style.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a clear, pale, amber color with a nice foamy white head with decent retention. Orange and grapefruit aromas from the citrus hops come through, and there is also a sweet malt aroma present for balance. The bitter citrus hops come through with falvors of grapefruit and orange, and there is also some sweet malt for balance, also a slight pineapple flavor is present. 		The mouthfeel is both sticky and oily, and the beer coats my mouth and tongue the way a DIPA should. Medium to full bodied with proper carbonation. A very good effort by Founders.";;;;;;;;;;
"Glassware: .25l Liefmans stemmed Pils		A: Deep, clear amber, medium carbonation. No lacing, the bubbles just slide down the considerable legs of this 8% beauty.		S: Where this beer really begins to shine, the oak comes through strong, along with a healthy dose of sweet, bready malt; no detectable hops.		T: the most barbeque-y Rauchbier I've had yet, and by far the most appetizing. The smoke is much more palatable and complex, with a very mild touch of vanilla in between the campfire, smoked meat (almost as reminiscent of chicken as the stereotypical pork), and very sweet malt.		MF: Getting towards the bottom of the glass and some of the carbonation is gone, but quite thick as it's sweetness and gravity would suggest.		D: Much higher than other Rauchbiers, this is just as drinkable as any other doppelbock I've had, helles or otherwise.";;;;;;;;;;
I picked this beer up at Krugels a week ago which a pretty sweet beer store. The Hopenstien is a nice golden amber color and the heads mounts up beautifully. The nose is a rich blend of malt and hops and lowkey in intensity. I like the flavor of this beer and, for all the hops, is well balanced. The finish trends toward hoppy. It seems a bit stronger than 6.5%. This would be an interesting beer on draft.;;;;;;;;;;
"First sampled this at the EBF and had reserved myself that barring a trip to Michigan, would probably not see this again soon. To my surprise, had from TPH on 5/23/06.		Presented from the tap in a big oversized wine glass with about a half pour. The beer was a jet black color with slight ruby near the edges. A thin sliver of tan head sat atop the beer and quickly faded. No signs of carbonation (as expected) and served at a significantly warmer temp. than most beer (as expected).		The nose was full of bourbon aromas and semi-sweet roasted malt. The alcohol came with traces of whiskey in it and chocolate undertone pervaded the nose.		The innitial taste is a slight searing of alcohol mixed with chocolate and roasted malt. Subtle bitterness to each sip and the bourbon flavor is quite pronounced. Robust to the finish with a hearty alcoholic presence throughout the sample.		Medium-heavy body with almost no carbonation. A sipping beer all the way.		KBS is extremely drinkable and perfect to sip and savor from a snifer as one would a fine whiskey. I found the bourbon flavors pronounced, but still not quite as much as they were at the EFB. Although ""only"" about 9% ABV the beer drinks and smells greater than that. Very enjoyable and one I hope to have again even if it means a trip to Mich.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 ounce bottle (bought as a 4-pack) poured into a pint glass. 		A: Pours a clear golden with a one finger white head, leaving light lacing along the glass.	S: Fragrant Hoppiness, but not really much else.	T: Very hoppy, but well balanced with the malts. I must admit that the wet-hopping of this beer contrasts sharply with the dry hopping of the Pale Ale, and it works.	M: Crisp, light bodied, and well carbonated.	D: Very good for a wet-hop harvest ale, competes with Sierra Nevada's offerings in my book as the best I have tried.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Hazy red, little head, lots of sediment. Into a tulip glass.		S: Muted to say the least. Some tart cherries.		T: Tart cherries, grapes. Sour apple. Meh.		M: Fairly high carbonation. Crisp. refreshing. Not overpowering.		D: Well, it isn't even close to New Glarus Belgian Red, which is just about as close to intense as this style gets. Good, refreshing, but, the large amount of sediment about freaked me out.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Poured a slightly cloudy golden straw color. Little visible carbonation. Two finger foamy/pillowy head. Moderate lacing.		Smell: Very malty/biscuit with some lemon citrus.		Taste: Moderate sweetness and maltiness, but less so than the nose. Some mild hops and lemon citrus flavors toward the end. Slightly peppery. Clean finish.		Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a decent carbonation bite. Smooth and somewhat creamy.		Drinkability: Very easy drinking pilsener that goes down smooth. Good flavors and good balance.		Buy Again? Yes.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured bottle into pint glass. 		Appearance: Has a very nice copper color that is semi-transparent. Didn't have much of a head, but the little bit there was, lingered for a little while. 		Smell: A very rich, malt aroma dominates the smell. There also seemed to be some kind of fruit aroma in the background that reminded me of a light cider. 		Taste: Again, a very rich malt flavor dominates. However, there is a balance here that keeps it from becoming too sweet. Could be hops, or could be caramelized malt that provides just enough bitterness to make this very smooth. Also has a very light cider flavor that just peeks through. 		Mouthfeel: Good body. Not creamy or thick, but there's a mild chewy texture that feels fantastic on the tongue and cheeks. 		Drinkability: Excellent. Could drink this beer anytime. In addition to a pint glass, I also tried it in a wine glass (as I didn't have a snifter or tulip available) and the aromas and flavors became even more apparent. Good anytime, anywhere, any which way.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from the bottle to a pint glass.		Light orange/yellow. Very minimal white head, not even half a finger with a pretty hard pour, fades to a this wisp with minimal lacing.		Smell is wonderful, easily the best part about this beer. Fresh cut grass, cat piss, tart grape juice, and grapefruit, very complex nose. First time I've ever picked out cat piss in a beer and it really is not a bad thing at all.		Very prickly almost tongue numbing carbonation in the mouth, medium mouthfeel, this is good.		Big fruity, citrus flavor. Kind of toasty? Not overly bitter. Very ""clean"" flavors, very drinkable. Definitely some citrus bite, grapefruit, a good bit of tartness. Having kind of a hard time picking up anything more, but I like it.		Overall this is exceptional and interesting like all of Founders' beers. A lot to take in here and a very enjoyable drink.";;;;;;;;;;
"I drank this in a side-by-side with:		a) Trumer Pils and a 		b) Warsteiner Verum (both German Pilseners)		to see whether I preferred the lighter edge to the Bohemian Pils or the hard water edge in the German Pils. 		The first two were very similar but the Urquell was much darker in color; I estimate double the SRM. I thought it would be the other way around.		The aroma was very pleasant, I believe it was the Saaz hop aroma, inviting and warm. Much nicer than the other two.		Very good session beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from the 12 oz bottle... thanks BeerMaverick!		A- Black. A little chocolate looking around the edges. Not much head, a little less than one finger. It disappears relatively quickly leaving some slight lace on the glass. 		S- Not overwhelming but nice on the nose. Coffee notes that are nicely complimented with hints of chocolate. Sweet malt with heavy bourbon scents. Excellent combination! 		T- Pure bliss. One of the best. Great coffee flavors with hints of chocolate and vanilla bean. The bourbon also really comes through in the perfect amount, has an almost spicy feel to it. Slight alcohol burn towards the finish, but its just the right amount that lingers. Very enjoyable. 		M- Medium to heavier bodied beer here. Lightly carbonated. Coats the palate nicely and almost feels like it coats the entire mouth with a film of flavor. 		D- Very drinkable. Can probably become dangerous at 11.2% abv. It has a nice drinkability with the pop from the bourbon. 		Cheers!";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured a thin collar of head from a bottle into a pint glass, deep ruby brown color with fine lacing. Some fine lacing.		Smell is peat and whiskey, caramel and dark fruit.		Taste is boozy scotch whiskey with dark fruit (raisin), caramel malt, nutty, and a chocolate note. Taste of whiskey is definitely not as prominent as the scent.		This is a medium bodied brew with some carbonation. Somewhat bitter with alcohol burn in the throat. The ABV is definitely unmasked.		Overall, a nice wee heavy although I prefer the Innis Gunn to this brew for the style.";;;;;;;;;;
"Vintage date 11/13/2002. Opened with a burgeoning head, still full of life. Noticeably darker than your typical tripel.		Age has added tartness to the well-balanced mix of flavors. Much malt, with apple and pear undercurrents. Alcohol is hidden to the point of disappearing - remarkable for a beer of this strength. 		Like the other 750s from Stoudt's, this is an exceptional beer. Its discontinuance is lamentable.";;;;;;;;;;
"I've had this on tap as ""Oak Smoke"" before, however I don't remember anything labeling it a Doppelbock then. Really gorgeous label for the bottled version.		Copper body with micro sediment suspended in the beer, giving it a fine granulated haze. A finger of tan foam rises up with a nest of larger bubbles in the center. It fades quickly, leaving a very thing ring at the edges. 		Heavy wood smoke, hints of peat and bacon fat, sweet and almost to a medicinal degree (more so in the taste). A little bit toned down from the burliness of the Urbock and Weizen. 		Brief malt sweetness first, instantly rushed by a complex wave of smoke, woody and layered. A dry bitterness from the Hallertau emerges in the finish and lingers into the aftertaste for awhile. Carbonation is moderate to low, and it's easily sipped. A really enjoyable Rauchbier that has intensity but doesn't overwhelm.		Paired this with a charcuterie plate of smoked sausage, coppa, and Cabot clothbound cheddar.";;;;;;;;;;
"A- pours a very hazy, rich amber with thick off white head that is retained and leaves heavy lacing		S- sweet fruity aroma followed my an awesome malty butterscotch		T- initial flavor of sweet strawberry/cherry, flavors of bourbon and oak take over, buttery malt, then the beer finishes with a tart strawberry character		M- medium to heavy mouthfeel, is silky, with minimal carbination		Founder's nails this fruit beer! It seems to me that too many fruit beers are just that, only fruit. The rich and distinct flavors don't overpower the beer at the heart of it all. I wish I could take it home with me!";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.		A - Rich amber, fairly clear, an eggshell colored, 1-inch head. A very good looking beer.		S - Grapefruit and a general citrusy hop aroma. Some pine resin and earthy hop tones. An excellent aroma. 		T/M - Full-bodied, lots of American hops. Plenty of grapefruit and pine. Hoppy, earthy, citrusy, smooth, delicious.		D - If you like citrusy American hops then you will love this beer. It's that simple.";;;;;;;;;;
"Wow!! Breakfast in a bottle. In fact, I made it a point to try these ( as a four pk., one at a time.) in the morning as a breakfast beer. The beer pours a black as black can get with a small for a stout head. It dose cascade quickly, so its a short show and she's ready to go. Lace is alittle thin and wispy. 	 The aroma is of expresso like coffee bean and oatmeal. The taste carries the oatmeal in the taste as well as the coffee, bakers chocolate and alcohol.	 The beer is very drinkable, thick, and chewy but not intrusive. The mouthfeel is smooth, sweet but with a burnt dryness left behind.	 Overall breakfast in a bottle? You Bet!!";;;;;;;;;;
"This beer pours a bright orangish/golden yellow and a very hazy body with a small white head. Almost reminds me of a slightly dark weis.		Nose is very crisp, super fresh malt with a burst of citrus hops.		Taste is clean, crisp and super fresh. Nice fresh grain malt, spicy rye malt and a perfectly balanced big but never overpowering bitterness. Citrus peel, grapefruit and all the other classic big american hop varietal touches. Very fresh hop and malt and very inviting.		So amazingly fresh it makes me want to drink nothing else. Seriously, I was at Bukowski's once and they had 5 other beers on tap I couldn't have any other time and I ordered this twice. Great freakin' beer.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours inky with just a touch of brown head. Nose is pleasant coffee, dark chocolate, and a generic but delightful light sugar. Flavor is rich and expands on the coffee and chocolate notes, with mild but supportive hops, brown sugar, and a light fruitiness. Finish is slightly sticky. Excellent porter.;;;;;;;;;;
"On cask at Fox and Hounds, Clavering, Essex, UK.		Pours glowing pale orange with a speckly loose white head that leaves white lace. Barn and hop perfume nose. Orange and hay malts following by lemon and anise hops. Tight finish with a bit of fruit and a barley syrup hit underneath. Dry-ish linger, oily feel, light to medium body.		Juicy! As much hop character (if not IBUs) as any American IPA. 		Beers like this are the reason to seek out cask ale.";;;;;;;;;;
A solid foam of rich tan head builds to two fingers thick with decent retention. Body is a deep amber brown that resembles barlywine styles. Nose is very attractive with fresh tea based hop notes rich maltyness shows a sweet side. It really gets the mouth watering. Malt and hops intertwine on the tongue during first sip. A rich dark burnt bitter is exceptional and unique for the style. Hop feel is subtle but well received. This brew really has a personalized feel to it, with an uncommon balance of bitter, richness and just the right amount of sweet. Mouthfeel is very robust for the style. Many hop heads may find this a little bit of a change of pace from what big American IIPA's have came to be known but it is a wonderful change. Alchol is super well hidden. I could drink this all day.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a bottle into my trusty Troegs pint glass. Gotta say, I'm really digging the design of this label. Classy and understated.		Mostly opaque, with very slight reddish edges when held up to the light. Inky dark with an off-white head that leaves some loose lacing. Rather prominent malty component can be detected in the initial whiff, followed by sweetish notes of chocolate, along with some roasted coffee. Quite nice.		Definite hoppiness in the first sip, as advertised. Founders definitely meant for this to be a balanced beer and it shows. The hops and mild bitterness are offset by the sweet malt and the smooth chocolate from the nose. These flavors blend together well, fusing as the brew warms. It's a very clean, well-done combination. Alcohol isn't really detectable at all. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with a good weighty feel and a slick finish. Makes for very smooth, easy drinking.		Founders has yet to disappoint me and their Porter keeps the streak going. I usually like their heavier stuff, but this porter is probably the best I've had the pleasure of experiencing. Another quality beer from a quality brewery.";;;;;;;;;;
Picked up a six pack of this while visiting family in Indiana. I was homesick for my McEwans back home. Luckily this did the trick! Poured very nice with an excellent dark, rust/copper tone. It has one of the best aromas I've experienced, a very deep, malty and almost peaty scent. Very nice flavor, a nice amount of malt. The only negative was that, even keeping in mind its relatively high ABV, the taste and feel of alcohol was higher than usual compared to other beers, which affected its mouthfeel considerably and its taste a bit, as well. Still, if you're going to have a domestic scotch ale instead of the real thing, this is definitely worth trying.;;;;;;;;;;
Appears amber with a thin white head with a top ring of lacing. Big resinous, earthy, grapefruit hops in the aroma. We're talking big aroma here. The flavor, however, doesn't quite stack up. It could almost be mistaken for a hoppy pale ale. The bitterness is medium, and the mouthfeel is a but thin. There's a lingering bitterness, but nothing major. I will say it makes for a decent session IPA. But the aftertaste holds it back from being great. It's sort of a dry and bitter mix of crystal malt with citrus rind. Basically it needs more hops. The dry-hopping makes for a killer aroma, but the rest of the beer can't quite match that intensity. That said, it's still a very nice beer. Cheers.;;;;;;;;;;
"A - pours a lightly cloudy amber color, 1 finger of head shows amazing retention and lacing		A - great aroma, dry hopped...citrusy grapefruit, pine, some mango sweetness, bready malt. good aroma i wish i would have cracked this one awhile back where im sure the aroma would have been much more potent but still sharp today.		T - good hop oils, again grapefruit, pine, not getting mango sweetness but the bready malts come through middle to end. not a big bitterness in the finish, no alcohol present.		M - on the lighter side but not light, tingles the tongue, moderate carbonation. 		O - i really enjoyed this ipa, not a hop bomb but good balance, founders just contiues to deliver solid beer after solid beer...one of my favorite breweries and i can't wait until they move some down here.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Dark amber tea with coarse, lively carbonation. On finger high off-white head that settles to a nice skin. Decent lacing. (4.5)		Smell: Mainly bready with hints of citrus-y pine. Sweet malt notes carried by alcohol vapors. Alcohol is much more pronounced as the beer warms (3.5)		Taste: Sweet maltiness in the front, hops in the body with slightly bitter alcohol finish. This bills itself as a DIPA, but I would like to see a little more in the hop department. As the beer warms, flowery notes appear. Altought I feel the balance is off a little in favor of the malts, it is still a tasty brew. (4.0)		Mouthfeel: I think it is from the sweetness, but the mouthfeel is sticky and chewy. For an IPA I would like to see it a little thinner and dryer. (4.0)		Drinkability: A fairly sweet (but still tasty in its own regard) DIPA that goes down easily, but halfway through the glass it can go straight to you head. Ill give it a 4.5 for its smoothness.";;;;;;;;;;
Appears an almost opaque cola ruby brown forms a large tan head leaves behind even specks of lacing. Aroma has some spicy rye and herbal hops along with a very nice mix of dark chocolate, dark cofee, and a touch of anise or mint like tones. Taste...a beautiful blend of chocolate powder, tea leaves, fresh ground cofee beans, spicy rye with herbal and earthy hop notes. Mouthfeel is Schwarzish light to medium body range smooth even carbonation. Drinkability...honestly challenging and drinkable an all day any season kinda beer great brew truly quality from Grand Rapids.;;;;;;;;;;
A: Pours cloudy with a beautiful white head. Color is gold. The head disapates as one drinks with light lacing down the glass.;;S: Hop aroma was citrusy strong with a hint of grassy note.;;T: A sweet well-balanced hop taste with very little malt taste with a dry finish. ;;M: A medium-light body with moderate carbonation. Overall a smooth finish with no asstringency.;;D: A refreshing and hoppy beer. Overall a smooth finish with no asstringency.;;
"Poured into a 5.5 taster glass from a Founders tasting @ Tavern on Liberty in Allentown.		A: Pours an opaque black with a light tan head.	S: Roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and dark fruits.	T: Some hop bitterness starts off the complexity, followed by roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate, and later sips result in dark fruits, perhaps plums and figs. Finally, there is a strong alcohol burn after nearly every sip.	M: Well carbonated, full bodied, but has a rough finish with the alcohol bite.	O: This was a notch below KBS & CBS, and probably two below the Nemesis. The alcohol burn was quite noticeable in this beer, though it has a similar strength as the others. Very true to style.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Very dark brown, almost black in color. Nice two fingers of dense, off-white/tan head that leaves behind soapy lacing a minimal film.		S: Pretty faint, but pleasant enough. Roasted malts and coffee mostly with some mild chocolate.		T: Faint nose doesn't lead to a faint taste. Bold roasted malts and coffee, balanced by sweet chocolate flavors. Good bittering hop presence as well. Nice tasting beer.		M: For a smaller beer(4.5ish), this has a pretty good body to it. On the full side of medium.		O: I like this a quite a lot as it reminds me of their Sly Rye Porter which is one of my favorites from Yazoo. It's full and rich with decent complexity in the taste. The nose, for me, is the only miss here. I wouldn't mind seeing this on Yazoo's regular rotation. Good job fellas.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had brownish color and a slightly cloudy consistency. Not a whole lot of head, but some good lacing.		S: This one had a nutty, malty smell, along with some sugary elements.		T: Very tasty. Nutty, with malt, caramel and a mild hops presence. Well balanced and flavorful.		M: Not a hugely carbonated beer, but has a smooth finish. Full-bodied.		D: Overall, this a drinkable beer. The taste is complex and the other elements are well constructed.";;;;;;;;;;
Got a couple of these in various trades.;;As I start to pour it I am shocked at how black it is. One if the darkest brews I have seen. No head at all so I pour slightly harder and still nothing.;;Smell is amazing. Straight strong burbon and bitter chocolate with alot of charred wood. It smells amazing.;;Wow. Awesome taste. Tastes just as it smells. The oak woody flavour is strong with the chocolate and burbon as well. Some vanilla notes as well. You can barely taste the alcohol but after a few sips it warms you chest up alot.;;Mouthfeel is great. Smooth and crisp at the end with the wood dominating.;;This beer is intense and I can finish a whole one for sure but another right after? I think not...
"Pike Dry Wit	""92% organic ingredients""	22 oz. bottle; Code: 101B	$4.99 at Total Wine & More, Claymont, DE		Appearance: Hazy yellow-gold body beneath a short head of creamy white foam. Head retention and lacing are both better than average.		Smell: Wheat, coriander, yeast, subtle orange. Light yeasty fruitiness (mainly apple). Mild grassiness.		Taste: Sweetish and doughy wheaty malt upfront. The spices are kept well in-check, and although the coriander becomes apparent right off the bat it doesn't overwhelm. There's something else going on, perhaps cardamom and/or clove. A hint of lemon and a nice bit of orange. Some leafy hops. Restrained bitterness: just enough that working in conjunction with the spice it remains malty but not sweet. It's smooth and rounded straight across the palate, ending with a quick bump of sweet malt that immediately fades into a light dusting of drying spice. Gently lingering. Nicely balanced.		Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a gentle caress across the palate. If there can be an improvement to this beer it might be that it could be slightly less malty or slightly more carbonated, or perhaps a combination of the two. That might help to display a little more of the finesse of the malt, spice, and yeast. Oddly, I'd heard that this beer was on the lighter side...? ... so perhaps there's a batch discrepancy or some bottles have been handled better or worse than others. Regardless, this is clearly more of an American take than some of the scrawny versions coming out of Belgium these days.		Overall: Richer than your standard witbier. Nicely polished and balanced. Lots of character but still approachable and very drinkable. Well done!";;;;;;;;;;
A- Pours a hazy copper color with nice thick head with decent retention.;;S- Scents of citrus hops and lightly sweet malts.;;T- Leads with a nice moderate malt note that heads towards sweetness but doesn't quite make it there quite pleasant. mid palate tells of hops to come by hinting of citrus. The finish is of nice an bitter piney hops and resins.;;M- Very adequate for this style of beer medium body with medium to light carbonation. Very refreshing.;;D- I could drink this beer all the time as a back up for my single beer tastings. Its just a very solid pleasant tasting beer with not too much of anything but not too little either. My only complaint is I wish it came in 12 packs.;;
Served in a 12oz green bottle. The picture on web sight shows the pilsner with a foil around the neck of the bottle. This has been changed to a golden paper.The beer had slightly skunky taste with distinctive sazz hop aroma and smell. It was around $8 for a six pack of bottles. If I had more cash it would be my party beer of choice, because of its drinkability.;;;;;;;;;;
"I opened this bottle and 	whoa nelly 	a bit lively 	as foamy ale surged out		poured witha rich dark chestnut brown body and a thick tan head that soon disappeared to wispy clouds but can be summoned with a swirl of the glass.		Nice smell of malt and toffee and brown sugar all there just in an elusive aroma, had to stick my nose right in there.		Nice taste dark and brooding on the tongue nice roasts and charcoal flavours coming through slight fruity hints but nothing sweet finished with a big malty kick and hoppy edges.		Really lively carbonation and a bit of a flimsy mouthfeel don't detract from a solid good beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Presentation: 1pint 9fl oz short necked brown bottle. No freshness date.		Appearance: Pours a deep, dark tawny brown (same colour as the bottle almost), crowned with a frothy, tight, off-white cream lace with plenty of retention and substance. Exceptional.		Note: there is yeast sediment in the bottle.		Smell: Soft, but distinct and bold, smoke aromas -- reminds me of spicy cold kielbasa and a wood fire.		Taste & Mouthfeel: Fairly light-bodied, with a touch of smoothness upfront that eventually turns a bit coarse on the palate, going bitty and crisping up from the beer's carbonation and a smack of wheat astringency and light floral bitterness. Malt sweetness is low, but there's plenty of body under the crisp dry character. Smoke flavours are everywhere, leaving a smooth char flavour that blends perfectly with an edge of spicy clove, wood character and splash of grape juice. Lots of residual smoke flavours rock the dry finish, hints of yeast.		Notes & Drinkability: I just love a good rauchbier, and this is one of the best. It combines the pleasantries of a tasty wheat beer with old school flavours to create one helluva an exceptional brew!";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from bottle to tumbler.		Appearance - Deep dark crimson brown, had to hold it up to light to see the red. Little to no head on pour, what was was tan none now.		Smell - Toffee and Caramel, smells like a Founder's beer. Some fresh fruits, can't quite put my finger on it.		Taste - Very malty, toffee, caramel, wood, tiny bit of roasted coffee. No alcohol but a nice earthy taste comes through. After a bit of warming, I catch apples. Little bit of a citrus hop bite at the end. Nice taste to this I enjoy it.		Mouthfeel - Very smooth, maybe a bit undercarbonated, nice little bite on the back of the throat.		Drinkability - Pretty good, can't taste the alcohol much at all, could drink a few of these. Good for abv.";;;;;;;;;;
"OK, anytime a hophead like me comes across a new beer with 168 IBUs, you just gotta try it! Shwinngg! Hoppin' Frog's Mean Manalishi DIPA is a monster beer.		A: Starts off with a huge, frothy, off-white head that dissipates rather quickly. Lacing is fair, not too sticky on the glass. Wow, the color is like beef broth! Not quite that dark, but just as murky. Heavy particulates (lees) that settle out but the beer remains hazy throughout the session.		S: Orange rind, molasses, hay, sweet dried fruit (dried prune). Very complex.		T: Full bodied is an understatement. Thick texture. Average carbonation. Sweet dried concentrated fruit, some citrus with a nice malt finish. A chewy beer, but in a good way. Surprisingly drinkable.		MF: Enveloping. Not as astringently hoppy as you'd expect from a beer of 168 IBUs. 		D: I'm impressed with this beer, but then again, I trend toward hoppy DIPAs. Not sure if I could do more than 1 bomber in a sitting. A full-bodied, complex beer. Enjoyed the experience. 		Overall: Highly recommended for those who like full-flavored DIPAs. Slainte!";;;;;;;;;;
"i was lucky enough to spend some time in bamberg this summer, where i sampled this guy's little brother, the maerzen. i was super excited to see this at chuck's in chagrin falls. the aroma is absolute heaven. i wish i knew what kind of wood is used to produce this smoke; i'd love to make an attempt at reproducing it. smoke is the dominant characteristic, but i'm totally okay with that		it looks like a dark brown ale or schwarzbier. the head on it sustains itself nicely		it's fairly bitter, actually, and there's a good amount of malty sweetness floating around under the smoke flavors. the smoke is prevelent enough that i can't really imagine what the beer would taste like without it, but i doubt it is meant to be a beer with a smokey hint. it's a smoke beast and i love it!";;;;;;;;;;
"Nearly black hard pour results in a small tan head leaving a thin film around the snifter.		Marshmallow, caramel, dark chocolate fudge, plum, licorice and anise at the forefront. Nice layers of dark fruit esters.		Rich and full bodied. Anise, and other black fruits dominate the palate, with a burnt caramel sweetness on the finish. Roasty in the middle and finish, dark chocolate, plum, raisin, black currant, tobacco, and some earthy herbal hops. Viscosity is large and long. Great beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottled 2/25/11	Served in a Dogfish Head Signature Glass		A: Jet black color with a lighter espresso colored head that lingers.		S: Exquisitely balanced scents of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, and a light caramel note.		T: Chocolate quickly, but smoothly, transitions to bourbon, with a malty vanilla flavor on the finish.		M: Creamy full bodied feel that has a nice gentle warming effect when swallowed.		O: The more I have this beer, the more I love it; I can sincerely say that this is one of the best beers in the world! I advocate hitting the Founders brewpub to see if you can get fortunate enough to get this on nitro, or other remarkable beer.";;;;;;;;;;
12 oz bottle in to a goblet.;;Pours a hazy orange with a clingy white head.;;bursting smell of grapefruit and pine. malt sweetness isin the back.;;taste is bitter hoppy with alcohol noticable after a couple of sips.;;much better than expected. full feel and 10% anv masked relatively well.;;
"Vintage: 2009		Serving Type: 12 oz. bottle poured into a Tulip glass.		A: Very rich in color all around. Silky black with 2 fingers worth of coffee colored head that holds strong. Lacing is tight and sticky. 		S: Smooth roasted coffee aroma, which adds a nice bitterness to this brew. A sweet, bready oatmeal aroma that is sure to finish this stout perfectly.		T: Deep coffee/espresso roasted malts. Hints of chocolate bitterness. All the flavors are rich & full. Smooth sweet oatmeal finish on the palate.		M: Full body brew that coats the back of my throat and soothes the slightly soar throat. HAHA! Very velvety and smooth. Slight carbonation.		O: Love this! I would love to get more of this if it wasnt so darn hard to get a hold of more than 1 when it comes out. Well, I guess I will have to wait around 4-5 months for this great stout again!";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Cloudy red-brown, small but dense head.		Smell: Dark fruit, then bourbon-boozy, oak, vanilla.		Taste: Brown sugar sweetness, then the bourbon comes along without being overpowering. Nice vanilla and oak flavors.		Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable, doesn't seem as strong as it is.		I didn't get a lot of peat or smokiness in this beer so it seems to be more of a straight ""strong ale"" than a scotch ale, but it is tasty none the less. Nice bourbon flavors without dominating the beer. Good stuff!";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a midnight black with very little head, but some lacing is left.		Nose is strong coffee, chocolate, roasted malts.		Taste is coffee, chocolate, some sweet malts and some bitterness on the way down. Nice and smooth, this is one tasty beer.		A very drinkable beer, even considering the ABV, which is well masked.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance  This one poured a deep, dark dunkel brown with a big, retentive head on top. I drank this out of my favorite German stein but poured a bit in a smaller glass to get a better sense of the appearance.		Smell  The strong, sweet, Doppelbock aroma jumped out of the stein. This is like smelling liquid brown sugar. The molasses is huge here as well. The malts seem almost like an afterthought.		Taste  The malts are much bigger on the tongue. They are stiff and complex and filled with molasses. The sugars from the nose wait to pounce out at the end and are very distinct from the beers body.		Mouthfeel  This is only medium-bodied but very sticky. The bittersweet flavors give this one a very busy mouthfeel.		Drinkability  Wunderbar! This went terrific with VENOMS DOPPELBOCK CHILI.";;;;;;;;;;
"A good porter, though a little too unctuous for my tastes.		Pours a deep, inky black with a thin, tan head. The aroma is strong and coffee-like, with a burnt edge, like coffee grounds. The flavor is rich and coffeelike, roasted, with a little smoked or burnt quality. The mouthfeel is quite milky and slick.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Pours a copper color with 1"" of white head. Great lacing, and pretty good retention. Moderate carbonation is apparent in this beer.		Smell: Smells of bready malts, slight spiciness, and both citrus and piney hops. Good smell, very aromatic.		Taste: Malts are bready and a light spiciness from the rye is apparent and very nice. Adds another dimension to this beer. Hops are both piney and citrusy, and add some bitterness to the finish.		Mouthfeel/Overall: Just under medium bodied, with a moderate amount of fine carbonatioin. Very smooth. I've been meaning to try this beer forever, but just hadn't gotten around to it. Glad I did this time. It's a pretty solid brew that differentiates from your run of the mill IPA.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: deep brown with hint of red up to light. very little head, solid lacing. 		S: strong aroma of mesquite, roasted nuts, malt, hint of carmel. 		T/M: earthy, wood, mild bread, sweet malt, fascinating flavor, med/light body, goes down very smooth.		D: This beer is fascinating and I bet goes very well with BBQ. The initial smokiness is intense, but mellows within a few minutes. I don't know why so many fellow beer geeks hate this style. It's very unique and highly enjoyable. Give the true liquid smoke a try! ;)";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a golden blond color with a one-finger head into my fluted tulip. Nice presentation.		Aroma is light and grainy with a decent hop bite in the nose. Seems sweet as well. 		Taste is full of hop bitterness followed by sweet, grainy malt. Inoffensive flavors that make it easy to drink and enjoy. 		Mouthfeel is a just a bit harsh but the hop bitterness lingers along with the grainy malt. 		A decent example of the style from the land that bore it. I can't say that it's the best I've had but it has more hop character than some other examples I've had. Decent.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Solid, dense head the color of a brown egg. The beer itself is a ruby red, borderline brown color and mostly translucent.		S - The malt aroma on this beer is sublime! Aromas include nuts, maple syrup, honey and a slight milk chocolate aroma, as well as a touch of diacetyl.		T - Very sweet upfront, then mellows into tastes of honey and astringent dark malts, and end noticeably bitter. Aggressive in both malts and hops.		M - Thick and tannic mouthfeel, but with a big bitterness that dries the finish and lingers.		O - This hopped-up version of a scotch ale may have a hard time striking a balance between sweet and bitter, but it's still amazingly flavorful and a pleasure to drink!";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours black, opaque, with a 2 finger tan head. Smells of dark roasted coffee, bourbon, chocolate and tastes very much the same.		The flavour is intense. Coffee and chocolate dominate, then a kick of bourbon, a little alcohol, vanilla, hazelnut, more bourbon, coffee and chocolate. Heavily roasted flavors dominate this beer with the mellow chocolate and bourbon offering balance while the vanilla and hazelnut round everything out. Very complex, very tasty, very delicious and very, very worthy of a perfect 5. 		Easy drinking for such an intense and flavorful beer and this really begs to be made available all year long. The bourbon character is present, but not dominating like most oaked or bourbon beers I have had. It complements the other flavors and helps round everything out, making this quite possibly, the best beer I have ever had in my entire life.		There is no hype surrounding this beer... It has earned it's legendary status.";;;;;;;;;;
This offering has a very good appearance that makes you want to drink it but the aroma just isn't there.  A very drinkable beer but if paired with food don't have anything to spicy or it will overpower the beer.........CHEERS;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a squatter. The color has a slightly hazy dark brown color to it. There is an off tan foam that last for some time and a slight tan lacing to the glass, but both eventually disappear.		The flavor is unique for my taste. A hints of brown sugar, toffee and nuts blend nicely together with a solid malt base. Its pretty smooth but there are hints of spiciness at the end. A zing from the yeast more then any noticeable hop or candi flavor. Somewhat of a bready quality and hints of chocolate that are subtle. The 8.5% ABV gives it a warm feeling but not overly phenol.		The body has a mid range feel to it. Limited carbonation but a smooth texture. Overall it was a good unique taste.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance  This one poured a clear but heavy orange in color with a good, strong, stubborn white head.		Smell  The hops are light and delicate and mate well with the smallest of grain influence. The nose here is well-balanced and nicely put together.		Taste  The delicate but firm grain mixes nicely with the traditional hops. The balance is what really makes this Pils, IMHO.		Mouthfeel  This is big, Id say a solid medium-bodied, with some light carbonation and an incredibly smooth mouthfeel.		Drinkability  This really is the standard for accessible Czech Pils here in the US. It went down wonderfully. I cant believe Im not getting a review up on the site for this guy until Jan 2005.";;;;;;;;;;
Jet black with a small dark-brown head that sticks around a little. The aroma is pretty much all coffee with touches of sweet malt and a daaaash of chocolate. The flavor is way upfront coffee with dark chocolate notes garnished with the delicious sweet and sour malty notes we all know to be a high-gravity stout! The luscious creamy mouthfeel is just the icing on the... oatmeal!;;;;;;;;;;
"Had this beer on tap at Anam Cara during game 3 of Sox/Yankees playoff series.		Poured a very clear amber/brown body with a small white head that died almost immediatly.		The nose was pure pumpkin pie spice. Cinnamon, allspice, with an upfront malt smell. One of the best pumpkin beer noses I've ever smelled.		The taste was just as amazing. Fresh, fresh pumpkin pie spices. Cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger. Malt. What really stands out about this beer is the bitterness. It's very bitter and slightly hoppy. The thing is.. it's perfectly balanced against the malt and pumpkin pie spices. An amazing interplay of tastes.		Simply put, where has this pumpkin beer been hiding? I've had a lot of pumpkin beers but this one might take the cake, or should I say pumpkin pie. It's like eating a fresh peice of your great grandmothers pumpkin pie but in beer form. So well balanced with malt, bitterness and fresh pie spices. A work of art.";;;;;;;;;;
"a - pours an auburn hue; head is two fingers of red/tan foam with minimal lacing		s - immediate odor of malted hops, blended with hints of wheat and other grains		t - hops are well balanced by a mild, malty aftertaste		m - cool and crisp, with medium carbonization		d - can put down one after another of these		This Irish Red is sassy like a lassie. Beats Killian's hand down.";;;;;;;;;;
"22 oz bomber poured in to a snifter.		Pours a thick black with a slow to develop and somewhat thin dark tan head.		Smell is sort of a roasty plum with some coffee in the background. Not as burned as some RIS's.		Taste is roasty and a little bitter. Slightly tart finish. Some fruit flavor in there.		Mouthfeel is very drinkable. Not sludgy like some, but not light like a regular stout.		there is some alcohol fruitiness and sweetness, but very drinkable for such a big beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Confronted with some wonderful brews, I find myself frequently returning to this well rounded and satisfying IPA.		Appearance - orange color, quality head and lacing.		Smell - hops are present, pleasing and appetizing.		Taste - intensely hopped, remarkable.		Mouthfeel - Good body, rich and satisfying - delightful hops.		Drinkability - despite the intense hops and high alcohol, goes down very smooth. Maybe too drinkable, leave the driving to others.		Overall - Exceptional American double IPA, has it all: taste, appearance, drinkability, and readily available, at least in my area. Highly recommended for those that favor a richly hopped IPA.";;;;;;;;;;
12oz bottle poured black as a steers tuchus on a moonless night. The smell of bourbon and coffee permeated the old nostrils. When first sipped the bourbon dominated the show, but as she warmed up a bit the coffee, roasted malt, and chocolate slowly oozed into the fracas. Personally I find KBS and Nemesis a little too heavy on the bourbon. Perhaps a coon skin cap and a musket would improve my demeanor...;;;;;;;;;;
"A: Brighter straw yellow/ gold, with a thick pillowy white head. It dissipates leaving behind a thin white head, and lacing.		S: As soon as I opened this one I got hit with grassy/ earthy hops, some sweetness, not sure what, maybe honey.		T: Grassy citrus hops up front... very nice. Followed by that biscut like malt, very well done.		M: Light body, good carb, crisp, and refreshing.		O: Very enjoyable pils, as expected from Stoudts.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a very slightly hazy (unfiltered) orangish color with good looking head - plenty of lacing as I drink. I expect the regular IPA aroma, but this one is subdued - seems just as malty as it does hoppy. The taste is quite pleasant. Mild peppery flavor. Different than the average IPA out there - the hops are there - only the bitterness doesn't kill your tastebuds after the first sip. This makes for one very drinkable IPA!;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a can into a standard pint glass. Beer is orange and clear. Tight white head forms and when it falls away leaves lacing on the glass. Carbonation is medium.		Aroma is good but pretty simple. It is piney hop aroma and not much else, I may detect a little sweetness. It is attractive.		Clean drinking beer, good bitterness all at the back finishes nearly completely. I would describe this as well balanced. As you drink it the aftertaste builds on you slightly, still a very drinkable beer. Body is medium, which is fine. I like this IPA.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip. Bottled 06/12/09. 112 IBU's, 12% ABV. TRIPLE IPA? Snap, this should be potent. Thanks to Sweemzander for another great brew!		A - Pours a hazy amber with an orange and deep honey highlight. The color mirrors the label exquisitely which is great design! The cream-colored head is small but has fantastic retention for the level of alcohol in this beer. Bits of lacing form on the glass everywhere.		S - Toasty breaded malt, very biscuity with a gooey glob of honey with potent hops. Not sharp, crisp potent hops, but sour grapefruit and citrus orange with pine needle. The aroma is more sweet and malty to combat the high level of hops more than anything else. Very complex and bot inviting and warning.		T - The flavor is so complex it's hard to know where to begin! It's both a malty and hop bomb. They are fighting for attention. Battling is a better way to put it. The malts come on strong and linger for the whole beer slowly becoming part of the background. They give off a sweet, almost cloying honey-coated bread flavor that turns into a citrusy, grapefruit-like bitter finish that packs one hell of a punch to it. You know when something is so bitter it makes your eyes twitch and head shake involuntarily? That's this. It's balanced very well and strong as all get-out with, for the percent ABV, only a light alcohol warmth at the end.		M - Definitely full-bodied with a sweet start and a killer bitter finish that begs to be taken a sip at a time. Smooth, borderline creamy from the sweetness and a touch of crisp carbonation at the end. Lingering dryness with sour grapefruit.		D - TRIPLE IPA?! Yeah. That's one of the most potent beers I've ever had. It's taking me quite a long time to finish but proves to be a great sipper that demands your attention as it smacks you square in the mouth with every sip. Two of these will knock you on your ass or have you dancing with the devil for sure.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a hazy yellow color with orange notes and a white head. In the aroma, a small fresh hop and a mellow malt backing. In the taste, dry, pine like, fresh hops that ride the palate all the way through. A small hop bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine hop in the aftertaste. The nose was lacking, but but tastes great.;;;;;;;;;;
A brown ale with abundant ice cream float head. Hoppiness and malty character and complexity, some cocoa. Earthy, touch herbal, bit astringent mouthfeel, which is fine with food.Lace in glass. Definite nuttiness. Surprisingly drinkable. Satisfying. Good for its style.;;;;;;;;;;
"pours deep jet black with a light creamy head. nice retention.		huge roasted malts and a touch of coffee with a bit of molasses		big coffee flavor up front, real big. nice and sweet roasted malts. light chocolate and hop bitterness. light dark licorice aftertaste. damn.		very full and very smooth yet kind of light. semi light carbonation.		this is one awesome porter. honestly, kind of reminds me of a breakfast stout only available year round. score one!";;;;;;;;;;
"A- Pours a very deep, dark purple liquid with some bloody highlights. The pink head is quick to rise and fall and leaves a ring on the surface.		S- A boatload of raspberries with some toasted bread on the finish. Simple but very intriguing.		T- Sweet raspberries... lots of them. A bit tart and bready on the finish. Overall, it is incredibly well balanced.		M- Light carbonation with a nice tartness on the finish. Clean and sweet.		O- Drinks extraordinarily well for the alcohol content. Simple, but really well done. Very sweet and would make for an excellent dessert beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"a: Dark red with a nice velvety pink head. good carbonation to it and decent lacing. Looks beautiful and rich...nice thickness to it		s: like dark fruit and sourness. hints of sweet alcohol permeate from the rim here.		t: raspberry up front and a mixture of dark berry in the mid. a hint of the typical belgian flair as you let this dry on the palette. There is a bit of heat this this, though it is a sweet wine like presence of alcohol that is welcome. I had the pleasure of trying this next to lindemans. I'd be interested to have a version of the framboise that was more in the 6-7% range...though I'm very curious of the heat this used to have when it was at 12.3%.		m: rich, creamy and with just enough fizz. any thinner here and it would have not been good.		o: a greate brew. Nice fruit flavor and just sweet enough that I can finish the bomber without feeling ill. Highly recommend";;;;;;;;;;
"New offering, a Mrzen coming out in the middle of winter - but a tasty treat she be, with enough spice and malt to keep it interesting.		Hazy amber pour into the shaker pint,  inch of ivory head nestled on top, leaving lace rings on the way down. Aroma of the spicy malt was subtle, but rich enough in the quaffing to make for an enjoyable drink. Full bodied with a dry and balanced finish, this would be a really good one in warmer weather - like early fall.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a deep ruby brown, thin off-white head with slight lacing.		A very complex nose. Sweet and malty, very fruity, with a caramel molasses feel. A perfume-ish sweetness on this one, vanilla probably. The alcohol, while I couldn't really smell it per se, it was detectable, it warmed my nose a bit. The thing is, everything blends so well. Smells like a really well made porter.		Rich malty sweetness with a bitter oaky finish. Kind of reminds me of the Podge Belgian Imperial Stout, which remind me of a stout/barleywine. Pretty dynamite stuff.		MF is very full, very heavy, a little bit sticky.		Drinkability - A great slow paced beer. Maybe not for everyone (my girlfriend - ""That's, um, interesting"") but will likely be a constant in my stock. I have a soft spot for Old Ales and I particularly liked this one more than some of the others I've had. Another excellent beer from Founders.";;;;;;;;;;
"a: pours a real orangish color with about a half inch of white head that doesnt dissapear fast leaving plenty of lacing stuck to the side of the glass	s: nice floral hop aroma balanced well with a kind of a grainy malt flavor	t: same as the aroma there is a nice floral hop flavor which is nicely balanced by a grainy/bready malt flavor	m: medium bodied beer with a nice smooth texture and low carbonation	 	overall, i really enjoyed hit brew, something that i will get in the future";;;;;;;;;;
"Normally, I don't like fruity beers or flavored coffees because I think that the flavors clash. However, I had this on tap at Founders on one of my vacation days where I tour the great lakes area in search of the great beers from the regional microbreweries. This one was impressive and very under-rated.		Appearance: A dark reddish brown with minimal head.		Smell: Outstanding combination of rasberry and malts.		Taste: Incredibly good rasberry flavor with a great mixture of tartness and alcohol bite mixed with some malty carmelly notes.		Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated with thick, sticky mouthfeel.		Drinkability: I would characterize this as the beer to finish a session with because I always like to start with the mildest beer and end with the boldest. I also wouldn't recommend more than two of these in a given session unless you need to catch up on your sleep.		Michigan beer rocks. This under-rated gem is a serious competitor to the Kuhnhenn Rasberry Eisbock, which you all should know because it recently was #2 on the B.A. top #100 list and I'm not sure if I could tell the difference if blindfolded. Michigan used to be the car capital of the U.S., but now I think it might be possibly one of the best states for beer in the U.S., along with California and Oregon (Stone and Rogue, respectively).";;;;;;;;;;
"It pours dark as night with a huge tan head; minimal lacing and an unusual amount of sediment. The aroma is all beef jerky. As a vegetarian this is slightly disconcerting, yet vaguely interesting. When I take the first sip the aroma comes in, roasted malt gets cloudy by an odd mineral water taste. It tastes like they brewed it with Gerolsteiner. The smoke is far more present in the aroma than the taste, however it does leave a nice bouquet. This is a pretty good beer that could be a great beer with some tweaking.";;;;;;;;;;
"It should be noted that this sample was taken from a closed case.		This is a gorgeous beer- a beautiful saturated yellow topped by a dense creamy head. Hops and malt are evident in the nose, almost a sweet grassiness. The texture hits a perfect balance between rounded and crisp. Hops linger in the finish- clean flavors all around. It's a wonderful beer when fresh.";;;;;;;;;;
"Big thanks to Jay23 for sending this beer.		Pours a reddish color with a finger or so of white foam. Presents a very good lacing and retention.		Smells of caramel malt and juicy grapefruit. Mostly caramel, grapefruit/citrus and bitterness, simple yet very well done. 		Tastes like an IPA with some rye in the finish. Good malt presence and some grassy and citrus hops in the finish, followed closely with some bitterness. I detect some bitter orange flavors as the beer begins to warm up. I like this one.";;;;;;;;;;
I chose to rate this beer on-tap when I was on a trip through Prague. I enjoyed almost everything about this glass of beer from appearance to drinkability. There's nothing better than a nice Czech Pilsener while relaxing along the Vltava River. Definately one of my favorite beers.;;;;;;;;;;
"Purchased a boxed 12 pack of mixed Cooperstown brews. Couldn't wait to get to this one. 		Appearance: What a head on this sucka. Big, bright, and foamy. Leaves a very thick off-white lace.		Aroma: Pungent hops with a good deal of sweetness from the malt and ringwood yeast. Almost a sugary aroma - I think thats the phenols I'm smelling.		Taste: A very good amount of hops in the brew. Enough to satisfy even the most hardened hopheads. Nice pale malt flavor in the background. Some sweet fruity notes. 		Mouthfeel: Easy carbonation. Good amount of malt in this brew yield to a good full mouthfeel.		Very drinkable for an IPA. This one went down quick. 	Went very well with my Kraft cheddar. 	Get some MF!";;;;;;;;;;
"Nice clear mahogany color (ruby red with the light behind it) with a moderate tan head that doesn't stay around and only manages a trace of lacing. 		The aroma is sweet fruity malt with a hint of caramel. 		The taste is lightly toasted malt, caramel, hints of apple or pear, and enough herbal/citric hops to balance the mild sweetness. 		Smooth, creamy medium bodied and very easy to drink. A decent cool weather brew with just a hint of alcohol warnth at the end.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours pure gold with a dense snow white carpets that leaves trailers. Nose is Golden Grahams, wax and flowers. Malts flip between sour grain and caramel pear before being cut by spicy, earthy hops. Long bitter cut grass linger, with a sharpness at the end. Light, thin and crisp.		I've heard this beer has declined in recent years - then it must've been a helluva lager before. Could use a bit more presence from the malts (and the resultant body) but fine benchmark for a Pilsener.";;;;;;;;;;
"After a few long drawn swigs of this golden autumn ale I drew the rest of her into a pint glass and started inhaling her slowly. It's peculiar sweet carmel earthy smell does not impact taste as the first sips will reveal a bitter bite lingering on the back of your tongue, while a mellow gingerish front entices you to take another sip.. Did I say sip or swig? 		 Perfect carbonation tingles the tongue and quickly dissipates as the bitter bites down revealing her complex roots in a sweet malt mash.		Two many of these and I may not be able to stop myself! There is a simple timelessness found in good English Ale's right in this one.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - The beer poured a clear, golden amber color, which produced a 2-finger, white, foamy head that was very well retained and produced some nice lacing.		S - For a Pale Ale, this had a very strong aroma to it, but what else would I expect from this brewer, right? The beer gave off a very nice pale malt aroma with some nice pine and citrus hops. 		T - The taste of the beer was pretty well balanced, I thought, both the nice malt flavors were there along with some nice pine and citrus hops. Very well done.		M - The beer had a light-er feel to it, very smooth, the right carbonation and extremely easy to drink. The beer also had a nice hoppy aftertaste, but not too hoppy. Perhaps the beer was hoppier than expected from an APA, but this is easily one of the best APAs that I have tried. This will be a constant in the beer fridge. How this beer is not in the Top 50 of APAs I do not know.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks go out to bwyker for cracking this bottle open.		A: Jet black with a mocha head. One half finger to be exact. Really nice lacing.		S: The smell was simply amazing in this beer. Spiciness was there as well as fire and bourbon. Nice. coffee and vanilla were there along with a ton of roasted malt.		T: Bourbon chocolate spiciness and coffee. I compared this to Bourbon County stout while drinking it and felt that there was more going on in this beer.		M: Heavy body I guess. I just wanted this thing to be tar due to the smell and taste so I guess this is where this beer fell short for me.		D: I wrote "" Bourbon County Lite"" hahahaa. This is a really great beer. I think the reason I like the other better is that there is simply too much going on in this beer. It is amazing. Every sip really did yield something different. I think the insanity of this beer is why is deserves to be a top nod.";;;;;;;;;;
"Label declares ""bottle conditioned"" Double IPA with dual circus elephant motif. 		Cloudy bright orange hued particle suspended pour topped off with a sticky 1/2"" high beige uneven spotty cap leaving respectable lattice lace. 		Fair scents of pine sappy, hoppy fresh squeezed orange juice pulp.		First swigs: Flavors are distinctly orange peel hoppy. Nearly some apricot schnapps due to the clean high ABV awl-kee-hawl distinction. A bit of acidic grapefruit slice and orange citrous meld. Clean lingering peppery citrous aftertaste.		Plenty of tacky thick syrupy body to compliment a 2IPA. Sticky, slightly thick, but short of being overbearing. 		Last swigs: Syrupy citrous orange/grapefruit focused concentrate with ABV bite. Complex enough to be tasty, thin enough to be quite drinkable. $40 a case in good ole beer freindly PA.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle, dated best by 7/20/07, with a purple lable graced by a scary looking ram. Pours a clear gold with orange tint. One-finger white head dissipates quickly. 		The aroma offers warm honey malt, a little orange, some floral notes, and a pinch of citrusy hops. Flavor follows, along with a strong presence of grain and other berry elements, a little phenolic syrupy-ness, and just a whisper of alcohol on the finish.		The mouth is light-bodied, yet offer a nice velvety fruitiness, balanced out by the warm malts and late, mild surge of hops. Very drinkable--a great summertime beer that offers enough flavor to be acceptable. Solid.";;;;;;;;;;
The tan dense head settles into a thin uniform layer that leaves sparse lace.  Deep ruby hue when held to light exhibiting excellent clarity.  Assertive caramelized sugar, deeply roasted malt, dark toffee in aroma w/ a candied fruitiness emerging at the end. As the beer warms, a touch of heaty fusel alcohols add additional complexity.  The flavor is dominated by tremendously smooth and rich dark coffee and chocolate-- there isn't the slightest hint of astringency to be found. The date - like malt sweetness overpowers the understated hop bitterness and is thus quite high, but isn't cloying. Full bodied but not overly rich. The finish is sweet, lightly roasty and a touch fruity.  This is one tremendously flavorful brew-- the myriad of flavors hide the high relative alcohol content.  Delicious.;;;;;;;;;;
"Nice creamy overlay on this puffy, strangely active head. Body, too, is oddly active, as well as a bold gold color. Great frothy lacing. Really a great looking Helles.		Fruity malts ride within the big floury oat nose. Rich.		Taste is mellow sweet notes and a medium, balanced body. Great level of mild hops make themselves felt. Sweet and hoppy grain flavor aftertaste.		Low carbonation makes for high drinkability. In this regard it almost seemed weak, yet seemed to hold up. Excellent flavor. Good beer to have just about anytime.";;;;;;;;;;
"founders double trouble		a 4.5 hazed golden color. very light for an iipa, but the head decends to a stratus cloud-impersonating cap and nice lacework is deposited most of the way down the glass.		s 4 a nice pineapply grapefruity yeasty ipa, but not as intensely aromatic as i could dream. 		t 4-4.5 rindy, yeasty, sweet. the yeasty taste is probably what's making it distinctive, not entirely unlike a belgian pale ale strain (not so much of this is noted in future bottles). the finish is fully-flavored, mostly grapefruit pith. definitely enjoying this more than hopslam this year. if only they add in some pine or other nice hop flavor to complement the grapefruit, we'd be looking at a bigtime favorite for me. 		m 4.5 typical founders mouthfeel, which is to say slightly (not markedly) lighter-bodied than one might expect for the style, with a relatively low level of excellent quality carbonation. the second bottle the following week seems bigger and thicker.		d 4.5 back to back against hopslam, double trouble strikes me as even more drinkable due to having enough rindy bitterness to counter the abundant pale sweetness. personally, my ideal iipa would feature something";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to both betsona and mjmadden for this	22 oz bomber pour into a snifter		A- Black with a very small tan head.		S- Roasted malts, chocolate, hint of coffee and alcohol.		T- Sweet chocolate, some coffee, some hops in the finish that add a nice bitterness, hint of alcohol.		M- Full body, smooth, creamy.		O- This is a good stout and I am glad I have another bottle try, hopefully it has a head. I have to say this is not a complex stout but a nice sweeter/chocolaty stout.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a small off-white head that quickly settles to form a thin cap. Very little lacing is left on the glass. Heavy smoke aroma that reminds me of smoked meat like bacon or smoked ham. Very smokey flavor as well that also hints towards bacon. There is some malt that gives some burnt bitterness as well. Fortunately some lighter malt sweetens it somewhat. Medium body and slightly overcarbonated. Just a little harsh. A nice smoked beer. Has some hints of a fine porter underneath the smoke.;;;;;;;;;;
This is a damn fine stout from Stoudt's! It pours an inky jet black colour with a nice tan head, that stays for a while and than goes on its way. The aromas are of dark roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate. The taste is the same, with some hops thrown into the mix. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the drinkability is top notch!;;;;;;;;;;
"well, obviously such a beer is totally light blocking. this s@#t is deep. brown sugar colored head that does diminish but leaves a good collar with fun ringlets at the surface		the aroma is rich and deep. strong vanilla and oaky currents tag team with the already strong roasted character. great depth here		a robust mouthfeel carries a great altitude of sweet and strongly roasted elements. dark fruit, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, and overall strong caramelization. slight ethanol heat reminds of the %, though dominates nothing		the barrel aging of this particular brew is quite classy. amidst a recent flurry of what has become quite a fashionable trend the barrel treatment of this one is exceptional. typically the aging brings a very boozy element (which, i should say, i do appreciate for a number of reasons. i still find those beers imminently enjoyable) that prompts one to ask exactly how much whiskey was added to the liquid. a very tasteful element is added here and the brew's depth is enhanced for it, yet in a mode far more subtle that i have tasted to date";;;;;;;;;;
Pours hazy amber with a decent head that retreats into circular colonies on the surface. Stringy lacing. The aroma is very weak for an IPA. Light hop oils. Taste begins with a sharp hoppy bitterness that dies as soon as it arrives, as it is tempered by faint malt. More dry-hopping needed. Mouthfeel is incredibly thin, too thin, and might explain the transient flavor. Larger body and pungency would do wonders to improve this IPA. Pike is an OK IPA, but certainly no treasure.;;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle to pint glass; pours a deep orange to amber color with a thin but ample head. Notes of grapefruit and pine really stick out, and the hop bitterness is superb. The bitterness lingers and grows more intense through the finish. Unlike many DIPAs, the emphasis seems to be on balancing the hops with malt rather than the reverse. This makes this beer seem much less sweet than the bulk of DIPAs.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours black with no hint of light passing through. A thin dark brown head makes an appearance, and hangs around til the end. Aroma of bitter bakers chocolate and alochol. Taste is very big. Starts off creamy and smooth, then quickly moves to a short lived acrid charcoal flavor brought on by black patent. Moving on to rich chocolate and coffee flavors. From there we find some warming alcohol enhanced by citrous hops. Thick and full mouthfeel marked by alcohol that burns the mouth slightly. Finish is dry and roasted with a very slight smokiness. Good offering from Founders, whom I have come to respect.;;;;;;;;;;
A- poured a transparent straw color. 1.5 finger head with medium lacing.;;S- a nice hop scent.slightly grapefruity.;;T- a nice well rounded american pale ale. a watery hop brew with the lightest malt presence but just enough to get the job done.;;M- light bodied. nice carbonation.;;D- if they only came in a 6 pack :(;;Overall- this is a good brew. i have to be an ass tho and give them nothing higher than a b+ for the fact of the four pack. they need to come out in 6er's!!
"Clear amber color, but hardly any head and/or lace. Big pleasant floral, hoppy nose. A lot more than expected! Good body/smoothness for the mouthfeel. Picked up some biscuit-like malt flavor initially, but then the hops take over. Almost like an IPA....very smooth, floral, easy-drinking, with a mild hint of citrus.... Pleasantly surprised in the lack of bitterness. Nice bier!!		overall: 3.9	appearance: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4		187";;;;;;;;;;
Was lucky enough to pick up one of only two available 4-packs at my local Anderson's stores on release day and drank a bottle right away chilled... Was mildly disappointed with the first experience since the 2009 was one of the best beers I have ever drank... Going into this I was well aware that the 2010 was a completely different style but was expecting a similar quality... After about a month in the cellar I broke out two more bottles and with a little bottle conditioning this became much better... Was very impressed with the aroma and flavor the second time around... Saving the 4th bottle and going to bring it out around the 1 year mark or save it for Christmas 2011 as I am also doing with a World Wide Stout and Backwoods Bastard;;;;;;;;;;
"Nice hazy orange with a good white head. 		The smell is very fresh, like something you just picked and haven't washed yet. Good balance between big hops and caramel malt. A bit of grapefruit sneaks in, too.		I taste a litle bit of soap upfront, but only for the first few sips. They're quickly overcome by some very nice grapefruit and pine hops (Pretty sure they're cascade but not 100% certain). Lack of complexity and the soapy start knock this down a peg, though.		This is a nice, flavorful APA that doesn't rape your palate and goes down smooth. An excellent session ale.";;;;;;;;;;
"Sampled from a 22oz bottle in a standard pint glass. No date on the bottle but it seemed fresh.		A - Copper with a slight haze and a big, enthusiastic head. Good, solid lacing as the glass empties.		S - Piney, grassy and floral hops with some caramel and honey and a touch of yeast.		T - Citrusy and piney hops lead the flavor but there's a solid supporting cast of lightly toasted malts, a hint of sweetness and alcohol. It's all held together nicely by a citrusy bitterness that runs from start to finish.		M - Creamy and silky with a nice low carbonation. 		D - I liked this beer more than I thought I would. This was a vibrant, flavorful, fun DIPA with a citrusy west coast bite but a little malt to balance it all out. I really think the freshness was the key. I think this one could go downhill fast if left on a shelf too long.";;;;;;;;;;
"I had this beer poured from a bottle into a weizen glass...		A: The beer pours a hazy, or cloudy w/e, golden color with a small white head, and no lacing...		S: The smell is spot on, typical banana, bubblegum, some spicy clove, just about perfect...		T: Almost as robust as the smell is, but a little subdued. The banana and spice could be shown more prominently here, but that really is just splitting hairs...		M: Crisp, light, perfect...		D: Along with Sierra Nevada's Kellerwies, this is the best American brewed Hefe-weizen IMHO.";;;;;;;;;;
"Brew with chocolate and de-bitterized black rye malts (among other things). 7% ABV, 40 IBUs, unfiltered, winter seasonal.		Pours to a very clear, nearly black, very dark brown, forming a large cream and soapy light tan head with just wonderful retention and gorgeous lacing. Nice looking brew. The aroma blows my mind...very fresh, green and oily hops (with a touch of skunky MJ...Amarillo anyone?) expertly balanced by a beautiful deeply roasted malt gestalt with notes of coffee, vanilla, black walnut and burning wood, but not with the expected density of a stout. Wow...this is just killer stuff. The mouthfeel is akin to a porter...medium bodied with a nice hop sting and light chalky astringency. Taste...reminds me of a perfect mix between what Bell's Porter used to be and Sierra Nevade porter...you have the hop intensity of SN but the mouthfeel/roasted sweetness/black walnut 1-2-3 of Bell's. Coffee, black patent without the empty charcoal, and a strong hop bite all meld into a wonderful brew. The bitterness is moderate, and the moderately astringent lingering deeply roasted notes mixed harmoniously with hop bite and light chalk. Cleanly fermented with no off-flavors...imperceptable alcohol.		Damn, I'm spoiled to be a Michigander. We've got some great brews here and Founders is in the top 3 as far as I'm concerned. Comparable to the quality of the other Underdog, Bear Republic. Just another wonderful brew from a world-class brewery. Another exceptional brew from Michigan. Highly recommended!";;;;;;;;;;
"Went to the liquor store hoping to see some fresh 4-packs of BS for sale. No luck. I did, however, find a year-old bottle hiding amongst a bunch of Old Curmudgeon and Cerise. Score!		I hard-poured the shit out of this stuff and was still only able to put a tiny head on the fucker. Even when served too cold it poured like motor oil with a small, brown head. There's not a drop of light shining through. Brilliant.		The smell is roasty-toasty malts, dark chocolate and coffee beans.		Oh, momma. Coffee, bittersweet chocolate and massive malts. FBS ain't nothin' to fuck with.		Mouthfeel is silky smooth and borderline chewy. Just like I like my stouts.		Drinkability is dangerously high given the abv. This is just a ridiculously delicious stout.";;;;;;;;;;
"This beer is dark, but not quite motor oil. There's actually a fair bit of trasclusence during the pour. However once it gathers in the glass, this thing is a completely solid black. A very gentle pour led to a one-finger thick tan/cream head - but it doesn't hang around very long. Quickly recedes to a nice crown that builds with the slightest bit of agitation. No real lacing to speak of.		My first sniffs of the aroma revealed primarily aggresive hops with a good malt, caramel backbone. As it warmed, though, some more character began to reveal itself - there's a medley of aromas here that vacillated between cocunut, brown sugar and fruit. I couldn't quite peg it down, and sometimes it included two, or all three, of those notes.		The taste wasn't quite as complex - at least not according to my palate. There's the strong hop character, supported by a decent malt backbone. There's also a roasty character on the backend, with an underlying note of licorice. In general, this is quite dry. The taste reminds me a bit of Batch 9000, but without quite as much licorice emphasis.		The mouthfeel initiatially felt a bit thin to me, but as it warmed and I delved further into the brew, the experience seemed to change - by the end, it was fairly full-bodied and sticky.		All in all, this was a good beer. Although the net result of my review here will probably be a pretty good score, I felt like the taste was a bit lacking. It's a good taste for sure, but I want to really be floored by these types of limited releases - and I just wasn't.";;;;;;;;;;
Cloudy, dense bright orange in color. Big ol' dose of white, long-lasting head. Sticky lacing of the glass. Aromas are divine. Huge notes of all sorts of fruits: pineapple chunks, lemons, orange rind mostly. Some peppery spice in here as well as a subtle medicinal alcohol mixed with a yeast flair. Flavor is a melding of citrus juices, caramel/honey sweetness, and spices. Finishes with another bit of spicy bitterness. Mouthfeel is good and, even weighing in at 9.5%ABV, this one is uber-drinkable. Will continues to impress. Cheers!;;;;;;;;;;
"Got this as part of my Microbrew of the Month club. 12 oz bottle into a pint glass		Adeep, dark brownish, black color with  inch creamy tan foam head		Sstrong coffee and caramel malts, very fragrant with some mocha aroma as well, mild sweet smell		Tbig and strong coffee and cocoa flavors, malty as I expected, a nice bittersweet finish		Msmooth and creamy with mild carbonation		Dan excellent brewto me, it is like drinking a cold espresso. Could drink several more as I really enjoy the coffee and cocoa combo.";;;;;;;;;;
"Kicking back after a nice night of Chinese food and Three Sheets, this one pours a very nice hazy orange color with moderate retention on its soft white head. Great lacing on the initial pour, but further down the glass, there isn't much. 		Smell is strongly of sweet malts with a good hit of citrus from the hops. Orange, vanilla, tangerine and apricots.		Taste is really malty as well, though not overwhelmingly sweet. Carmelly and slightly bready with citrusy flavors all over. Tangerine, orange and grapefruit make up the hoppy flavors, and the finish has the bitterness of orange peel with a slight alcohol burn. 		Mouthfeel is really creamy, oily and slick, which would be perfect were it not for the astringency caused by the bitter bite at the finish. Chewy. 		The alcohol in this one is hidden well, and there isn't enough sweetness to be cloying. A smooth drinking, tasty beer, I would buy this occasionally were it available in my region. 		A- is the perfect grade for this one. Well done, community.";;;;;;;;;;
"Big ups to JM03 for the smoke out! 		Pours very dark amber/red with a fluffy 2.5 fingers of tannish head. Lace was ample. Out the gate theres a huge smoke presence; open camp fire, cooking a whole sh*t load of bacon. It's smoky like that. There's a subtle nutty, malt aroma in the back. That smokiness carries over abundantly into the taste. There's a bit of a spicy, bready note in there, and after the smoke clears, theres a rich maltiness in the back fighting for stage presence. The lesser side of this is the feel...bit to far on the light end of things. Overall though, solid Rauchbier, though probably my least favorite so far of the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauch's.";;;;;;;;;;
"This is my highest rated beer ever!!! (So far). Rich black brew with thin lacing poured from the tap. Aroma of chocolate, coffee and bourbon tickle my palate. This stuff is sooo smoothe. I managed to score a case of this precious brew and I will savour each and every bottle with friends and family that can appreciate the time and effort poured into this gem. Without going into detail, the method of producing this beer is worth the wait.	Thank you Founders!";;;;;;;;;;
"A- Clear amber color, a tad bit hazy which I really like. About a fingers worth of head. Leaves a nice lacing on the side of the glass as the beer is consumed.		S- Citrus and Fruity scent with a background of earthy hops.		T- Delicious! Very strong citrus and earthy hop profile followed by a caramel malty taste. The hops were more than I expected from this beer, although they are not overwhelming. No alcohol taste in this beer. 		M- Chewy resin like feel as the beer is in my mouth and as soon as I swallow it, it leaves a wonderful aftertaste. this. Feels quite thick 		D- This is one highly drinkable beer due to the lack of the hint of alcohol. Probably could drink this as a session beer. A real Michigan treat!";;;;;;;;;;
"Currently #7 on the BA List, opened to kick off the 2008 Super Bowl, acquired via trade from MuenchenerKindl, poured into a Stone Old Guardian tulip glass, ""Is good for everything a stout ought to be good for""!!!		Appearance is thick and dense brown-to-black motor oil, minimal brown head mostly disappears but there is some cream and bubbles on the edges, very mild lacing		Smell is huge roasty malts, espresso with tones of bitter chocolate, bourbon, woody oak, and vanilla are prominent, touch of dark fruits and molasses/brown sugar		Taste is predominately bitter coffee/espresso complimented well by the bourbon alcohol and wood presence and backed up with bittersweet chocolate, there is great balance here between those primary flavors, some molasses and alcohol warming in the finish		Mouthfeel is very full-bodied, thick and viscous texture you need to chew through, ample carbonation		Drinkability is good, I liked this considerably better than the original Breakfast stout which was much more coffee-forward and not as balanced, the alcohol is subdued despite the 11% level, this was definitely a treat, hopefully I can get my hands on more in the future.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to Warriorsoul for this bottle. You rock Tom!	Poured into my DFH Raison D'Etre longstemmed-oversized goblet.	No head to the beer upon pouring. Whisps of tan lace surround the outer reaches of the beer, and stayed there for the entire beer. 	Color of dark burnt chocolate with some ruby highlights. You couldn't see through this beer with x-ray specs. 	First smell was earthy dark chocolate infused espresso. Thin aroma of hoppy-alcohol soaked kalamata olives in the background. 	Tasted of roasted bakers chocolate, heavy malt, toasted barley and cocoa powder dusted oatmeal. The coffee taste and smell is like the first espresso of the morning. The tastes change from sip to sip, really defining the complexity of this offering. The meadium body on this, along with the smells and tastes makes this one of the most drinkable stout I've ever had.	I really don't want this beer to end, but I seem to be drinking more than reviewing. My sips have turned to gulps and I don't have the control to stop myself. So drinkable a stout this is. I'm down to my last sip or two and have to force myself to draw it out. 	Finishes like a well-done caramel mochiato with oatmeal thrown in for good measure. 	Beautiful beer Founders. Now I just gotta get to MI to grab a case or 5.";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at the Brickskeller in DC last night. 		Founders makes some impressive looking stouts and this is no exception. Jet black with a dense, thick, dark brown head with great retention and lacing, this is one gorgeous beer. The nose is similar to my experience with this beer out of a bottle, but a little different. There's copious amounts of coffee and chocolate, with plenty of roasted malt, but there's also a more pronounced bourbon character, with a pleasant, welcome booziness and some vanilla. Caramel character is low. The palate is quite the whopper. Big coffee and chocolate up front with plenty of roasted malt bitterness. The coffee is big, with plenty of espresso character, and coupled with the medium-full body, it just feels like one. Bourbon is quite prominent as well, with heat and vanilla present. Bitter chocolate and coffee are present on the finish, along with a boozy heat. Pretty solid stuff, I drank about 20oz of it and could have gone for another glass.";;;;;;;;;;
"Now this was a rather unique looking beer to be honest. When I originally got it I really did not know what to think of it, so the best way to find out is just go ahead and try it, which is exactly what I planned on doing. Poured a very light bright red, almost a pink with very little in the way of a head on top and just the slightest touch of side glass lace. The carbonation coming through was very full and left for chains of bubbles streaming up through the bottom. The aroma was very light and sweet, not really deep raspberries like you see in some others, like Raspberry Tart for example, but a light sugary raspberry, akin to a wine cooler. The taste was very light and crisp with a refreshing nature to the feel. Ample carbonation kept it lively throughout and a decent fruity aftertaste followed. Overall this was pretty decent, nothing spectacular, but still pretty decent. It was a nice novelty one off selection, though I dont think I would go this way again. I am starting to like the fruit beers; I just like them a little heavier then this one.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appears a hazy orange with a small white cap that quickly fades into a mild collar. Spotty lacing is left around the glass.	Smell is lemony with orange zest, berries, sunflowers, honey, and a touch of bananas.	Taste is of cracked grains, honey, sunflower sees, zesty citrus, and doughy yeast.	Mouthfeel is yeasty, bready, sugary, citrusy-sweet, with cereal grain and semi-tart wheat sticking to the palate. A somewhat thin finish detracts from the brew.";;;;;;;;;;
"Served in a Dogfish Head snifter.		Pours the way a big, bold stout ought to: deep pitch black (or is pitch ""KBS-black""?) with a quarter-finger of burnt sienna head that dissipates into a flat cloud lingering on the surface. A slight bit of sudsily-ringed lacing is left behind. The nose has a seemingly unhealthy amount of wood in it, almost as much as a small forest. There's also some bourbon, maple syrup, molasses, dark roast coffee, and charcoal smoke, making this one of the darkest-smelling brews I have ever had. That said, the coffee, wood, and bourbon o'erwhelm the other notes a bit, leaving me an iota unfulfilled. The taste marks a second manifestation of the nose: heavy wood notes, bourbon, molasses, vanilla, smoke, nutmeg, dark roast coffee, toffee, and a hint of chunky peanut butter. This is a fair improvement on the nose, and leaves very little to be desired. The body is indeed pretty hefty, but not too much so. The low carbonation, thick chewiness, and spitefully smooth feel all lead to a high drinkability, though this brew is clearly not a gulper; rather a highly enjoyable deep-sipper. Definitely lives up to the hype!";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours murky light mahogany, with a moderately building off- white head.	Bashfull carbonation recedes to a ring around the glass quickly, with only a trace of lace.	Aromatics start off with a ""wow"". Substantial amounts of bourbon, oak, cherries, brown sugar, and vanilla.	Boozy and rich, fruity and approaching vineous.	Alcohol is warming and the Curmudgeon becomes more approachable as he warms up.	Thickish and syrupy mouthfeel, slick and chewy.	Pallet is a bit brash and aggresive.. Subtle, is not.	Loads of residual malt, alcohol-soaked fruit, oaky tannins, toffee, caramel, and bourbon.	Bitterness to check, and alcohol is apparent and flattering, not overpowering.	Finishes a bit sweetish with warming bourbon notes and an oaky dryness.		A large example of the style, and should benefit greatly from extended cellaring.	Kickass.";;;;;;;;;;
Wow what a nice pour!A medium brown with a reddish tint with a huge foamy head that sticks nicely to the glass,aroma is very cracker-like with a touch of cocoa but just a touch.A very clean tasting beer lightly sweet and grainy with a touch of iron and a hint of clove.Now this is a beer to drink for any occasion clean but satisfying and just enough flavor to make it interesting a real winner.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into weizen glass:		Pours clouded golden with a rush of carbonated bubbles forming a one-finger white head, that pretty quickly goes to a thin cover. Minimal lacing sticks.		The smell is of banana/clove - banana really stands out - with doughy wheat.		The taste is of banana/clove with doughy wheat There is a tart, fruity zest. Tastes more like an American Pale Wheat Ale with a solid Bavarian Hefeweizen leaning. Malted, doughy, wheat, tart-ish fruitiness, with noticeable banana/clove mix together. It has a crisp finish.		It finishes crisp and clean with some creaminess, but also a fizzy edge. Quite smooth. (I was between two scores - a ""second"" of the two I had convinced me to give it the higher of the two scores).		This is a nice thirst-quencher. Not convinced that it's on par with some ""classic"" HW's - more of an APWA/HW, but does a fine job with that. Very easy to drink and refreshing!";;;;;;;;;;
Bottle: Poured a dark pink color ale with a nice bubbly pink head with average retention. Aroma of pure raspberry is of pure enjoyment (I was a bit scare at first that this would be another chemically induced fruit beer). Taste is refreshing and raspberry totally dominate by bringing a balance between sweetness and tart. Alcohol is well hidden. Very well done for a style that comport to many misses.;;;;;;;;;;
Pours a light golden color, with two fingers of white head. Smells are citrus hops at the front, with slight pine hops and malt. Tastes are citrus hops followed by a slightly sweet malt middle and a hop finish that is abrupt. Very well balanced and drinkable.;;;;;;;;;;
"Growler, filled yesterday, into Sam Adams sensory glass. Been looking forward to trying this one for awhile now, and at $7 a growler fill, this is a bargain. 		Pours black, fading to ruby brown at the very edges, with a big, 3 finger, dense brown head. Excellent retention and lacing. Can't knock the looks on this one. 		Nose is light, a bit of smoke over a very roasty body, roasted barley and a bit of burnt grain. Nice nose. 		Taste is nice - subtle but big flavor, not at all overwhelming. Starts with a very light earthy note, a bit of anise and a light smokiness coming through, leading into a flavorful but mild dry, roasty body that has just a bit of earthy, almost rye-like chocolate bite to it. Avoids some of the acidity and bitterness commonly found in many of the style, but still fits in to the niche nicely. Finish is dry, just a bit of lingering acidty, some smokiness. This isn't going to blow anyone's lid off, but man is it tasty, with a nice complexity. I see many, many growlers of this in my future. 		Mouthfeel is light in body, maybe just a bit watery towards the finish, low carbonation is smooth and easy going.		Drinkability is fantastic. Easy going and inviting, this one just begs for a second glass before the first is even halfway done. An entire growler of this over the course of an evening would be no problem. Very happy with this one.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance- Dark but not black. Kind of looks like thin swamp water I guess but thats what I was expecting. 		Smell- Smells like a campfire. Such a potent, potent campfire smell. 		Taste- Same as the smell with a little bit of malty sweetness way underneath. I was shocked at how much this beer tastes (and smells) like a campfire, straight up. 		Mouthfeel- Medium to full bodied, decent carbonation. 		Overall- Glad I tried it. Before this I had never had a Rauchbier and always wanted to try one. I prob wouldnt spend the money on this one again but its one Id reccomend having under your belt.";;;;;;;;;;
A few peculiarities off the bat with this one: firstly, a clear bottle? Interesting choice considering a less than appealing colour. Secondly, why was this a gusher? Moreover, how could it have such an abundance of head in the bottle, then none once its poured in my glass? This was a slimey yellow-lime in colour. The aroma offers a considerable wine dimension. Fresh and with a sort of savage primitivness. A hard swirl would really bring out the wine character, considerable white grape dryness. Some mild tartness to the flavour makes for a very interesting mouthfeel. Never thought I'd taste something so succesfully adventurous in this style. This creation has imparted plenty more dimension than I ever thought possible in a plain, all-malt lager. I enjoyed trying it, thanks CRWills.;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours an clear orange-honey color with a moderate and multi sized bubble cream colred head from a 16.9 oz. tapered neck bottle. Head disipates quickly if you fail to give it a forceful pour.		Scents of crabapples, followed by other fruity esters. Yeasty and crisp. Very fresh and clean.		Flavors of clean prickly hops with honey butter and (faint) ginger. Has a fresh herbal flavor with just enough malt balance to keep it balanced. Funny, but the green apple Jolly Rancher bite-sized hard candies come to mind...seriously.		Mouthfeel is delightful. Airy and kinetic with a good dose of playful carbonation. Light-medium bodied with a crisp semi-dry finish.		Drinkability is very generous. Quenching with a lot of interesting flavors that will keep curious drinkers coming back for more.		Overall a zesty and high quality ale. A perfect balance of sweet and dry with a crisp and slight tart component also. Complex but very approachable. A great year-round offering for beginners to veterans. A fine english ale indeed.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from 500mL bottle into a pilsner glass.		Appearance: rich golden hue with a clear body and good effervescence. Head is two thick fingers of creamy foam leaving a good lace as it dissipates.		Smell: sweet, but not too sweet, caramelly malt with just a whiff of earthy hops. I like it quite a lot, actually.		Taste: lightly sweet with a bit of caramel. Hops are not quite as active in the flavor as in the aroma, but overall I think this is a very tasty beer.		Mouthfeel: body is on the lighter side of medium but the beer seems rather aggressively carbonated, which yields a pretty solid creaminess. Good stuff.		Drinkability: I'm finding this beer quite drinkable. It's certainly good after working out side for a little while, but I'm betting it's pretty good in other contexts, too.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Very deep blackish-brown in color. Thin little head with no real lacing to be seen.		S: Strong coffee, darkly roasted malts, some nice hints of chocolate.		T: Bitter coffee taste is the first thing I notice. After that taste comes a nice roasted malty taste that lingers. There's a nice bit of sweetness to this.		M: Slick, a bit mouth-coating. Carbonation is just right, and the alcohol is barely noticeable.		D&N: As I have yet to develop a taste for an imperial stout, this beer is quite nicely suited to what I like at this time. This is a big bodied beer that's quite nicely done.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a large, but controlled, head (about three fingers wide). Dark gold color with a light hue of orange. Hazy. Light spotty (and streaky) lace.		Clean, almost lemony pale malt aroma. Very mild spiciness in the background. I detect dark cherries and raspberries as well.		Starts with a pale malt where the alcohol warmth is pronounced. Lots of orange and clove (particularly strong in the aftertaste, which reminds me of the aftertaste from Grand Marnier). Plums and apricots complete the flavor profile. The low carbonation balances the lighter-than-expected body. Very easy to drink.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured into a pint glass. No bottled on or bb date on the bottle. ;;A- The appearence is great. Nice dark golden brown that is almost amber. Gave a nice full inch of head that is thick and cake like and seems to not die down at all. ;;S- I get alot of hops in this brew. Alot. I get a nice all around malt character as well. A bit of bitter citrus that seems overwhelmed by the hops but still a note. ;;T- The taste is great. I love the bitterness to the centennial. Alot of great hop character that it seems like only Founders can put together so well.;;M&D- This is a very drinkable beer. The smooth texture of the brew just seems to go down easily. It give a full texture that makes you want to drink more. There is a descent amount of carbonation that tickles the throat and goes down well.;;
"Appearance - Thick off-white creamy head on a copper amber colored beer.. Has a beautiful full bodied head with excellent head retention. Head carried to the bottom of the glass. 		Smells - Definite toasted grain smell combined with and English hops aroma.		Taste - Noticeable flavors of roasted malt. Very smooth and with a very subtle tang of hops.		Mouthfeel - This beer is silky smooth with a light carbonation that was surprisingly noticeable. 		Drinkability - Great beer and I would rate this very high in its category, really enjoyable.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz can into nonic.		Crystal clear honey amber hue with a thick two finger head that seems to last forever.		The malts are well hidden behind very aromatic piney hops. A little bit of honey is in the background. Though the hops are sharp, the seem slightly subdued.		Toasty grains set the base, which linger throughout. The hops provide a citrusy and bitter flavor, with a little bit of lingering sweet fruit. Full bodied.		This one seemed to disappear from my glass quickly. Very drinkable and well rounded. I like this one a little better than their Pale Ale, although both are good. Recommended.";;;;;;;;;;
From the growler and fresh. Dark golden brown. Pours with little head that lingers for a while and leaves a bit of lacing. Citrus bursts, hops and tangy. Mouthfeel is tart and refreshing, lasts forever. Finishes with the same citrus and tangy flavor of grapefruit. Hops still present. Better fresh than in the bottle if you can get it.;;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.		A-Oil-black beer, looks viscous out of the bottle's mouth. Deep, dark brown chocolatey head, frothy and solid with OK retention, considering the style. The collar of bubbles remained for most of the time.		S-Heavy chocolate, slight bitter coffee aroma. Roasty.		T-Rich chocolate malt, bitter chocolate and coffee, with a hint of alcohol in there, too. Hop character and bitterness seems to arrive later and linger into the chocolatey aftertaste.		M-Thick, full body, as is evident from the appearance. Carbonation is medium-low, smooth, contributing to its frothy feel.		D-VERY tasty imperial stout. Thumbs up for this one. Smooth, deceivingly easy to drink. I want some more right now :D";;;;;;;;;;
pours a black brown color with spare to no head and spare to no lacing, and soft carbonation. chocolate coffee oatmeal taste and smell. chocolate smell especially potent. very sweet with some perfume hop hints. bitter tart sweet finish. full body, and oily creamy texture. long flavor duration. by far the best stout i've ever had. this beer is amazing!!! if you haven't tried it i suggest you get your hands on one.;;;;;;;;;;
"12Oz. bottle purchased as a single at Marty's in Newton on 1/27. Served in my DT tulip. Poured the color of engine oil with a tight, half inch, mocha-colored cap embedded with bubbles. Head eventually dissipated into a band that coalesced around the bowl and some swirls of foam; some spots of lacing present adhered during the tasting. Nose was cocoa, coffee and dark fruit. Taste consistent with nose; however, dark fruit disappears and a slightly boozy quality comes out manifested as a lingering bitter astringency at the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and oily with a little bit of carbonation prickliness. A solid RIS, but not my favorite - a little too much alcohol and didn't quite achieve the mouthfeel qualities I like in an RIS.";;;;;;;;;;
"Superb! Better than their Mrzen! Deep, dark, clear chestnut hue, with a fine, creamy tan head which fades quickly. Great smoky/malty nose... Unbelievable aroma of smoked meats. Lovely! Quite smooth and almost full-bodied... The extra sweetness present by being a Bock makes this a wonderful bier. A perfect level of sweetness with a huge dose of Rauch! Awesome! Dry finish with smokiness lingering long and hard. Mmmmm!!		Zum Wohl!		overall: 4.6	appearance: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 4.5		3";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Pours a coffee brown, with a brownish, grayish  inch head. Watery, carbonated, lacing on the side of the glass on initial pour. 		S: Roasted malt and coffee nose. Nose is not overwhelming, but fair. 		M/T: Medium, syrupy body that slides down the tongue. Roasted malt hit, followed by a carbonated sting and coffee flavors. Finishes earthy and malty, that takes over the whole tongue. Fairly balanced. 		D: With a very high APV and a thick malty aftertaste, this beer is not session able, however the alcohol base is barely noticeable. Solid drinker.";;;;;;;;;;
The brew was poured at the brewery and came out as a yellow orange color with a good opacity to it. The beer has a decent thin lacy head, this beer has so much apricot coming off of it, it has a sweet fruity aroma with a little bit of sourness on the nose. The Taste was pretty awesome I thought. It was a tart and sweet flavor at the same time. The mouthfeel was oily & creamy. The beer overall to me is exactly what a fruit beer should taste like. It was just really nicely done in my opinion. Hopefully others will enjoy this brew as well.;;;;;;;;;;
"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a pale malt scent along with nice floral hop aroma. It's light and refreshing. The taste is good. It has a very light pale malt flavor, although it reaches 6.2% abv.. It also has a kick ass hop flavor that quite floral and bitter. This is an easy drinker; very light, yet flavorful and full of hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I love the hop presence; very well done.";;;;;;;;;;
Picked up a can at Abe's Cold Beer for a couple bucks and drank it with a Thai curry (good combo). At first seems like a simple, but tasty pale ale. The malts provide a little toast and caramel, while the hops pull in the usual citrus notes. As it warms and I think about what I'm tasting and smelling, a lot more comes out. There are hints of pineapple in the hops, hard sugar candy in the aroma, and peppery spice compliments the orange rind aftertaste. Check this beer out and make sure you let it warm up.;;;;;;;;;;
"Curmudgeon, vintage 2008		Served in DFH signature glass		A: Pours clear deep amber with ruby highlights. Little head is produced, but a surprising and striking effervescence courses through the beer.		S: At first flush, a fairly typical profile of an aged American barleywine: caramel, golden raisins, leather, earth and dark, dried fruits. Also, tea and what I would imagine tobacco leaves smell like. I swear I smell cedar when I agitate the beer.		T: Caramel and brown sugar lead off and are next joined by golden raisins. An understated bitterness creeps in, introducing earth, leather, aforementioned leaves, as well as wood. I think cedar is still suggested by the sum of these parts, but not as strongly as in the nose. Secondary characteristics peel away in finish, leaving light medium-light bitterness and wood. No hint of alcohol.		M: Heavy body with medium carbonation. Silky smooth on palate. Somewhat warming, which is to be expected.		O: Old Curmudgeon holds together its disparate elements quite well, better than my descriptions represent. As the beer warms up, the bitterness seems to increase, too, becoming a more dominant player. Still, this beer is a great sipper and is brewed for extensive cellaring.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip		A - Golden and hazy. Frothy head that creates a lot of sticky lace.		S - Citrus, mainly grapefruit, but a hint of lemon, evergreen		T - Piney, citrusy, resiny hops. This masks the alcohol and yeast quite a bit, but the slight banana and bread flavors still come through.		M - Medium body, great carbonation. Very sticky and then dry on the finish. The hops definitely stick around.		D - I'll be heading back for another bomber of this. It is kind of high on the ABV scale, but you could easily go through a few bombers with friends.";;;;;;;;;;
This beer pours a great red/pinkish color. The smell is very sweet and filled with raspberries. It has a great taste and is perfect for a summer night. My only complaint is that it is almost too overwhelming with fruit but only after the first few. Great beer give it a try.;;;;;;;;;;
"A- Poured into a Duvel tulip, with a deep amber red color and a half finger of creamy off white head. 		S - Nice hoppy grapefruit smell along with caramel malt sweetness		T - Great balance! A hoppy bite that hopheads will enjoy along with the proper amount of malty sweetness. Tastebuds seemed to detect a touch of peach in the flavor. 		M - medium mouthfeel and stickiness, along with moderate carbonation		D - Most excellent! Not really a session beer but a great tasting, high quality brew from Founders. Liked this one a lot.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a clear yellow gold color with a  inch foamy white that faded slowly and left great lacing and rings of foam on the glass and a ring of white foam on top of the brew; looks like a pilsner with an IPA head. 		Smells very hoppy up front with a blast of floral hops and piney hops up front, followed by flowers, grapefruit, citrus hops, orange peel, mild grains, sweet malt and some light caramel; the floral hops and herbs dominate the aroma with such a fresh hop aroma that it smells like there's one floating in the glass. An excellent aroma! 		The taste is very similar to the odor, with a blast of hops up front with floral hops, piney hops and citrus hops, followed by grapefruit, orange peel, sweet malt, flowers, mild grains, caramel, herbs, grass, lemon zest, biscuit and a nice slightly bitter pucker in the finish. The hops control the flavor and while the malt sweetness attempts to balance this beer it's really all hops, citrus and floral herbs, with a slight hop spice mixed in with the malt sweetness. Overall the flavor is excellent. 		Mouthfeel is oily and silky smooth, with very light carbonation, and a very light, crisp body that helps this go down easy. 		High drinkability, as this is very tasty and the alcohol does not show at all. I could drink this anytime and all night, and highly recommend this beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a snifter. Dark black body...light eating dark. Formed a two finger head that dissipated a little too fast. Some legs/lacing.		Chocolate, dark coffee, roasted malts and a hint of vanilla tackle the nose. 		Black coffee hits your mouth first. This is followed by a wave of dark chocolate and caramel. Finished with a toasty bitterness that balances out the flavors nicely. This fades as the beer warms.		Medium mouth feel...creamy with little carbonation. Just what I expected/wanted from this beer.		Another quality beer from this brewer. Close to the perfect stout...robust and tasty. A great example and will keep these stocked for myself and to share.";;;;;;;;;;
"Found this one by surprise at Le Dep de la Rive while shopping for a beer trade. I like old ale so why not! This one was brewed in 2008 so it had aged a bit.		The color is brown with a muddy looks. Not very appealing for some but to me it is very interesting.The head is creamy and slightly beige. The aroma is malts, fruits and some sugar. The taste is earthy (typical for this brewery) with a bitter finish. More malty than hoppy. Not bad.		Medium body beer and for an old ale, pretty easy to drink. The mouthfeel is very good too. The taste lingers in the mouth.		Good beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 16.9oz brown bottle.		Pours a golden yellow color with a nice big head, decent retention. Some nice lacing too.		Aroma is a bit sweet. Grainy with malts and barley coming through with some hop aroma as well. Some very very faint citrus like aromas. 		Taste is malty and grainy with some mild sweetness. Some slight hop bitterness is there but is fairly mild. Mouthfeel is decent, drinkability is pretty good. This is pretty typical of a Euro lager, nothing special. 		I really like the bottle label too.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle most generously furnished by Hoppymeal, to a pint glass. The liquid is a light shinny gold with curiously fine carbonation, The head is most interesting, a big 2 fingers of tight white foam, extremely creamy looking that lasts quite a long time and leaves incredible amounts of lace. 		The smell is great, very hoppy in the nose, mostly citrus with some floral notes.		The taste follows well, citrus hopps quickly over take a biscuit like malt, leaving oranges, lemon, sweet cherries, cranberries and a spritz of lime in its wake. This is a very good brew, not over the top buy a huge winner with in it's style.		The mouthfeel is good, nothing out of the ordinary, slightly less then a medium body, and great carbonation...except it is so fresh it makes my teeth squeak, like fresh cheese curds.		The drinkability of this brew is evidence that this brewery is world class.		Many, many many thanks to Hoppymeal and his conspiratorial trader, for giving me a taste of this brew. 		Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK";;;;;;;;;;
Mild spicy hop aroma. Foamy, brilliant white colored head fed by dozens of streams of medium sized bubbles. A few strings of lace sit atop the clear, pale yellow colored beer. Light malt flavor is quickly overtaken by a solid bitter bite. A light sweetness makes its way in towards the end cutting the bitterness before all the flavor fades fast in the fairly dry finish. Light bodies beer, easy drinking, the bitterness goes away after a 1/4 beer or so.;;;;;;;;;;
stoudt's apa pours a lovely copper color, unfortunately that is its best trait in my opinion. the smell is interesting, it has a fruity aroma that brought to mind tropical fruit juice mixes, but i don't usually buy beers based on their bouquets. i really can't give it higher marks for taste, it has a pretty standard bitter, hoppy, fruity ale taste which didn't do much for me. it feels good and light on the palette adding to it's drinkability. not bad, but nothing special.;;;;;;;;;;
"poured into a pint glass		A.		 a beautiful dark stout. almost black. a nice frothy head.		S.		out of this world. smells like a frappaccino from Starbucks. a little alcohol smell but mostly coffee with hints of chocolate.		T.		incredible. has the roasted malts taste from a stout but a strong coffee flavor. A bit of bitter chocolate in there as well. the alcohol isn't as strong as you'd think. 		m. 		not watered down like Guinness. A nice full bodied beer.		D.		could drink this all day. of course i need to be in the mood for a little coffee. the alcohol might sneak up on you if you've had a few however. definitely a beer to sit back and relax with. i think this would be excellent with a little vanilla ice cream (serious). i could definitely see having a couple of these a week. even for ""breakfast"". too bad its a seasonal brew.";;;;;;;;;;
"500 ml bottle, BB date says 6. July 2011. Pour into tulip creates deep golden to light amber body with good clarity topped by medium, persistent dense white head that clings to the walls weaving solid lacing. The head gradually sets to a stable cloth. 	Malty aroma with evident toasty-melanoidin character, notes of caramel and some faint unobtrusive alcohol. 	The flavor is rich maltiness with prominent toasty-melanoidin qualities, caramel, peppery spiciness from the hops used or alcohol and the right amount of supportive hoppy bitterness allowing moderately dry, bitter-sweet finish with both malt and hop taste. 		Medium to full bodied with moderately low carbonation and some alcohol warmth. 		In short: A well balanced, somewhat spicy helles bock with explicit toasty-melanoidin qualities and refined bitter-sweet finish. An excellent contribution from this state-owned brewery.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: From the tap, this beer pours an auburn russet color with a thin taupe colored head atop this beer. Throughout consumption of this beer, there is a thin patchy layer of head atop this beer. There isnt any lacing left on the inside of the snifter glass.		Smell: Hot damn, this beer smells good. The aroma of this beer is a beautiful blend of bourbon, oak, dark fruits, caramel, and vanilla. If this beer tastes half as good as it smells, we have ourselves a winner.		Taste: Basically take what you get in the nose of this beernow stick that on your tongue. Alcohol is warming, but not overly boozy. It is rich and malty. The caramel and dark fruits make this beer slightly sweet. The body of this beer is slightly above medium. Even with the high ABV, this beer is highly drinkable. This is a great beer to have on a cold winters night.		Notes: Had this beer on tap at the Kinsale in Boston before a Tenacious D concert at The Orpheum. Has this beer as both a pre-dinner drink as well as a post-dinner drink. Hell, this beer was so good; it should have been my meal.";;;;;;;;;;
"Jet black pour with 1-finger of possibly the darkest head I have seen on a glass of beer. Thin, thin sheen of bubbles leftover all the way to the last sip. Motor oil dark with no hint of anything else. 		Nose is mocha, light vanilla, and deep bourbon. Underneath is a bit of bright, dried fruit. Getting more mocha and light roast malt, with coffee, as the glass warms.		Vanilla, dark roast coffee, a touch of mocha and cream, and a blast of bourbon define the taste. Lots of layers here. Excellent bitters in the finish and not the least bit harsh. Very smooth and creamy. Light fruit here, too, with a bit of cherry and very light citrus. Alcohol burn starts to kick in with the 3rd or 4th sip. Hard to get better than this.		Feel is very creamy, slight bit of fizz in the finish, and very smooth. 		Overall, wow.";;;;;;;;;;
"2010 Bottle		A: Pitch black with a minimal tan head. Fair amount of lacing left behind.		S: Bourbon right from the start. Followed by coffee and some dark chocolate. Also notice some alcohol and a bit of roastiness.		T: One complex beast but still balanced. A great blend of coffee, dark chocolate and bourbon, with the appearance of some vanilla, a hint of oak and some alcohol burn. Amazing flavor.		M: Low in carbonation but thick with a smooth, creamy body.		O: An amazing beer. Ages very well. I look forward to it's release each year.";;;;;;;;;;
"sampled on tap at cbc oct 16/09.		pours thick and opaque black with a thin layer of very fine brown head that quickly retreats to a ring around the glass. a few spots of lace.		aroma is great. bourbon and oak. dark and milk chocolate. coffee. light alcohol. big biscuit and multi-grain bread. earthy.		taste is great. anise and vanilla. bourbon and oak. dark and milk chocolate. bit of coffee. caramel and toffee. candy-like sweetness, but it manages not to be too overbearing. touch of citrus. bit of earthy character too. roasty.		mouthfeel is excellent. nice big chewy body. medium-low silky smooth very fine carbonation.		drinkability is good. a touch sweet, but otherwise quite balanced. rich and decadent. i'd love to sip on this one all night, but fear that i wouldn't make it home afterward. great stuff.";;;;;;;;;;
"Notes from 6/24		A: Bright golden glowing beer in a moment of clarity with a lively white head of feathery fluff		S: The ginger is definitely there, or am I smelling my Indian dinner? Almost cake-like in its malt aroma, sharply bready with a slight edge of sweetness		T: Nice clear malty throat taste, reminds me of strands of complex sugars and grains, ginger is more subtle than I expected, more of an undertone than a backbone		M: A refreshing light beer feel, like a pilsner or summer ale		D: If this was a sixer instead of a double-deuce, I could see this being a fine picnic pounder		Overall, pretty impressed for the particular style";;;;;;;;;;
"A: murky brown and black body with deep burnt orange borders. Pretty close to ink black. The follow up and formation of a massive buff brown head erupted with my rather weak pour. This thing was incredibly active as chunky boulders of soft chocolate rocks sat atop, with staying power. Lacing had a few honorable mentions, with one large smear of particular interest hugging my glass. Looks like a ""Pike Stout""		S: heavy hitting dark malts with faint chocolate, coffee, and bourbon types whiffs. Nothing stands in as being very woody, but you could stretch the senses after a heavy huff to include oak and vanilla within the bourbon/alcohol notes. If I remember right, this does a pretty good job of replicating the original Pike Stout with a few new smells		T: upfront are the dark malty notes, this is followed by crushed dutch coffee beans with a sturdy helping of bitter chocolates. A few sips in, when you let things gather, the predominant flavor revolves around the bitterness. The cocoa and coffee notes are free to roam and pick up lightly spiced vanilla with, you guessed it, wood-barrel (almost winey) flavors. The bitterness is claiming more coffee character as the sips continue and things are even darker with the malts taking form as blackened and smoldering. Warming augments a few dimensions. Otherwise the pungent flavors coat most everything on the tongue shortly after the sip		M: pretty heavy brew with some good girth points. The carbonation is in good order and right for the style. Another thing, the ABV just lurks around and never gets in the way, as it's always under control. The finish nips the palate with a baked dryness 		D: the original Pike is banging, and the Pike Entire is banging. The original has been a go to brew for me and the same follows suit for the wood aged. If any discrepancies exist, which they really don't, it might need to mellow out just a bit with the bitter features it carries. 	Well, in any event, is it tasty! Get a hold of it";;;;;;;;;;
2 12 oz bottles into a Duvel tulip. Pours a bubbly hazy pale orange with a nice abundant frothy head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves decent lacing. Aroma is a very fragrant load of citrus hops. Taste is a nice balance of crisp present citrus hops and some subdued sweet malts, good, but a bit of a let-down compared to the aroma. The beer is very light crisp and refreshing with decent carbonation. This is a very enjoyable fresh hop beer, just a bit expensive.;;;;;;;;;;
"A: Almost red but a bit lighter, very nice white head leaves great lacing around the glass as the head decimates. 		S: Sugary and lots of hops		T: The taste of this beer is exceptional! Lots of citrus hops with some grains,very bitter, but the sweetness takes that away at the tailend. 		M: Very good mouthfeel, not to heavey not to light. Very pleasant. Smooth 		D: Definitely a beer to drink about an hour after dinner, very filling but one of my favorites!";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle sampled in a snifter at 55*F. 		Pours a viscous inky jet black with virtually no head to speak of. 		Exquisite, up front aromas of freshy ground dark roasted coffee beans and semi-sweet baker's chocolate with some licorice and molasses lingering in the background. 		Mouthfeel is almost perfect for this style; round, slick, smooth and slightly oily. 		Intense, rich flavors of espresso coffee, dark chocolate and black malt come agressively to the forefront, supported nicely with hints of vanilla, caramel, molasses and charcoal. Very well balanced overall, starting out slightly sweet but quickly finishing with a moderate, but long charred oak, hoppy bitterness with the alcohol warming the finish up admirably. 		I wish I did indeed have another one of these for my breakfast tomorrow morning! Great stuff!";;;;;;;;;;
Boston area I can get it for less than $2 a 500 ml bottle, a six pack of the stuff in NYC is about $12. Needless to say I like buying it in Beantown. Perky white lace and a good golden clarity, clean aroma with a whiff of hops and sweet malt. Superb crispness with a dry malt character that brings a bready flavour to the palate, clean in the mouth with a quick snappy bite of hops that linger into the after taste. One of my favourite Euro lagers.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a tulip.		A - Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color with nice orange hues. There is a slight white head thats about .25 inches tall. Similar look to Double Trouble but with a slight more ornage hints.		S - Delicious grain and bread malt starts quick but then is followed by some delicious citrus and tropical fruit hop nose. Hints of tangerines, grapefruits and peach as well. There are some nutty hints as well as delicious flowery notes. 		T - Starts off with delicious grain notes that give the beer a nice bready and toasty initial flavor and character. Then there is a nice present but not too intense hop flavors with some slight dry citric notes. A great flowery flavor is also present on the back end of the beer along with the dry citrus part. This is a delicious wet hopped ale and a great APA. No wonder its so high on this site. I really enjoyed this and its one of my faves. The body is nice and medium with some great clean crisp flavors. Nice bitterness level and not too intense hop bite.		D - I really enjoyed this beer and think its one of the best out there in terms of APA and wet hop ales. Very refreshing and not too heavy ABV.";;;;;;;;;;
"Picked up a single bottle from Archer Liquors in Chicago, IL.		A: Pours a hazy unfiltered pale yellow-amber color with white head that leaves good lacing.		S: hops, citrus and pine		T: tastes very piney with bits of citrus and hops; almost bitter grapefruit and pine or something...not very sweet; the more i drink it the more i like it, but it's still not ""wow""ing me.		M: Definitely coats the palate which you would expect. above average carbonation		D: high drinkability because the alcohol doesn't stick out. the flavor doesn't keep me coming back for more though. it's a solid brew but nothing i that makes me want to buy another over other DIPAs";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle to pint glass.		A: Pours with a 1 finger head, small and off white as the head on most ESB's tend to be. Sudsy and quickly diminishing with a film remaining until the end. Absolutely no lacing. The color of the body is a clear copper orange mixed with amber, medium saturation.		S: Above average malt component toasted caramel, toffee and grain. The hops are fighting a losing battle here, barely able to add a woody pine resin contribution. Light earthy yeast.		T: Light alcohol detected despite the low ABV. Flavors of plum, prune, toffee & butterscotch come to mind, along with light diacetyl. The Scarlet Lady has a respectable amount of flavor, especially considering the mere 5% ABV, but still shy of impressive. Flavor retention is above average as well. Moderately sweet (as in opposite of dry), slightly sour, and bitterness is next to none.		M: The mouthfeel is in need of improvement. Light body with a slick texture that borders on being thin. Average carbonation.		D: Drinkability is good. Would not mind revisiting this brew again (especially on cask or) when a long period of imbibement is anticipated.";;;;;;;;;;
"Jeff at Party Town kicks ass. He brewed this with BBC and has growler fills exclusively at the store. And for $5.99 a growler at that($7.99 if you need the growler).		Poured into an imperial pint.		A: Pours a coppery amber color with good visibility. 2+ fingers of creamy head forms and has some retention. Decent lacing throughout.		S: Healthy dose of hops, Centennial(?) is prominent. Citrus, pine. Some sweet malt to balance and a nice snap from the spicy rye. Pretty straight forward but nice.		T/M: Decent bitterness level. I don't think a bit more bitterness would hurt anything but it's definitely not too low. More of the citrus and pine with a hint of spearmint. Malts balance nicely with a bit stronger rye flavor than the nose suggested, spicy, peppery, and well played. Body is medium to medium full with a very creamy body and refreshing carbonation.		D: Very drinkable. 7.5% is actually a bit surprising but that's not too much :)";;;;;;;;;;
On tap at Capones. Pours a dark coffee color with a very thin head. Has an aroma of coffee. Has a nice smooth balance of coffee and smoke. Has a slight bitterness to it as well. Very tasty brew from a great brewery. I Will have to try side by side with KBS.;;;;;;;;;;
"A - Pours a nice black with a thin mocha head that dissipates quickly.		S - Roasted malt, unsweetened chocolate, vanilla, molasses, a hint of bourbon.		T - A bit of hop bitterness up front followed by tons of roasted and caramel malt. Some sweetness to it. More chocolate as well as some grapefruit pith from the hops. Some darker fruits in here as well. Raisins, plums, and a hint of figs.		M - Nice low carbonation, creamy, medium bodied.		D - Nice and drinkable. An excellent brew for this cold December Illinois afternoons.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle poured into a pint		A- Very light golden color, very pretty. Leaves a finger of head that covers the glass in a wall of lacing as you drink.		S- Very flowery and sweet, Hints of pine and peaches at the end. 		T- Very well balanced brew, strong hints of grapefruit and some pine notes. Very subtle taste, quite refreshing. Some good sweetness with this one and the perfect amount of booze. 		M- Perfect carbonation, very refreshing. 		D- Very easy to drink, I loved this beer. I had one while I cooked some dinner the other night and I had to have another right after because it was just so good! Great job Founders!";;;;;;;;;;
Bottle picked up at Keg & Bottle 2. Pours a deep dark brownish color with some ruby outlines. Strong smokey barbeque aromas. Some chocolate in there as well. Thick rich roasted maltiness. Bitter coffee and lots of smokiness. Some sweetness as well. Finish is quite bitter. Enjoyable smoked bock.;;;;;;;;;;
A: Nice burgundy brownish red color with a decent head on it.;S: Slight alcohol notes with nice woody aromas and a slight sour sweetness.;T: This beer puts me in the feel of dark fruit (plums raisins etc) while maintaining a roastiness from the malt with some slight hoppiness.;M/O: Crisp and drinkable with some very good weight from the alcohol. Very good strong beer.;;;;;;;
"Bottle at the Mundelein beer tasting. Pours clear and golden with a two finger head of fine bubbles.		The aroma is dominated by herbal Saaz hops; this is a real Pilsener. The flavor is very light, with a little bit of malt flavor and hop bitterness on the finish. This is one of my first Czech pilseners, and probably the hoppiest lager I've encountered.		The mouthfeel is light and briskly carbonated; hugely drinkable. 		I'm not a big fan of the style, but this is the quintessential example and I don't imagine you could do much better than this. I'd be interested to try it on tap, since those green glass bottles might be making for a lot of lightstruck beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Another unique Schlenkerla...	It is a murky brown with a rich but rapidly dissipating foamy tan head.	That fantastic smell of charcoal/burning wood fireplace/smoked sausage that my wife hates. 	The taste is also very good, similar again to smoked sausages with hints of jerky beef and some sweet maltiness. 	Mouthfeel is lighter than you would expect, but still pretty good. Easy to drink, and goes very well, as expected, with smoked meats - I loved it with sausages, it is just a perfect pairing.	I am not exactly sure about the Weizen, other than the murkiness and perhaps a very faint citric taste I could not really notice anything that would even resemble a Weizen. Anyway, as I started, another great Schlenkerla..";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into an imperial pint at 45F. Thanks to my gf's mom for a lovely Easter present!		A - Poured a lovely dark amber, the color of a dark violin bow rosin, with copper hues in the light. A lovely off-white creamy head that retained wonderfully and gave ample lacing all over the glass. True eye candy right here. 5.0		S - Lovely esters, hint of pears and apricots, a biscuity backbone and a bit of earthy hoppiness. A hint of sweet tobacco and leather rounds out the nose. 4.0		T - A rather robust beer, hints of sweet caramel and light fruits are followed closely by raisins and earthy hops, lending a bit of bitterness near the finish, and finishes mildly roasty with a touch of metallicness and caramel. 4.0		M - Medium bodied, or at least, that's the perception that the carbonation gives me. Rich and satisfying, a touch of dryness in the finish. 4.0		D - Quite. I finished the bottle pretty quickly and wanted more. 4.0";;;;;;;;;;
"I drive between Portland and Seattle alot so I love to stop at this brew pub along the way (Tacoma) to pick up some treats for home.		22oz take home bomber bottled at the brewery. A nice amber color with a bit of haze and visible yeast particles which I don't mind. Nice creamy head and sticky lacings. 		Smell is sweet and yet hoppy, must be the fuggles.		Taste is awesome with a strong malty flavor, hints of apple, and large amounts of hoppyness. Creamy mouthfeel with a more sour than bitter aftertaste. This one is very drinkable so enjoy one if you get a chance.";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at Pizza Paradiso at Dupont in DC. It was served rather cold, but I tasted it immediately and took my time with it to let it reach a warmer temp.		A: Thick, dark body with a beautiful creamy head.		S: I had this with another beer geek and we both agreed this is the best-smelling beer we had ever encountered. It was like the sweetest dark coffee of all time. I love dark coffee served black, and this was like the best coffee brew I've ever smelled, plus a malty sweetness to back it.		T: Coffee. Oh yes, so much rich, dark coffee. Where coffee flavors this deep and dark might make a lesser beer bitter, there is a beautiful malt back to it that balances everything out. I savored every sip, and it only improved as the beer warmed.		M: I wish I could feel this with every beer. There was a beautiful fullness that I can't aptly describe. A warming as it went down from the ABV, but the maltiness on the tongue prevent any boozy flavor.		O: Incredible. This is my favorite aroma of any beer. The taste is nearly equally amazing. I had serious doubts about this beer because of its god-like status on BA, but it delivered. Thank you, Founders. This beer alone made my night.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours with a nice lively 2 finger head, which hangs on for a while. Sheet lacing is present. Hazy yellow straw hue, very pleasing to the eye. The aroma is quite bready/malty. No discernible hops smell present. The taste is wonderful. Initial sweetness attacks the tongue with a very nice hop finish, which produces very good balance. The mouthfeel is very smooth with just a bit of a hop sting; very pleasant. I could drink a sixer of this in a session, with no problem.		One of the best Helles I have had. Better than most German versions I've had. If you like a balanced beer with a malt character, you can't go wrong with this specimen. Very well made.		Thanks to Myles at The Cork for recommending this gem. I think I'll pick up a case tomorrow.";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at Flying Saucer Charlotte. 		A = Super dark brown/black with minimal brown head. Light lacing.		S = Smell wasn't overpowering here. Could pick up some boozy whiskey notes in addition to chocolate and coffee. 		T = Unbelievable collection of flavors. Where do I begin? Bourbon, whiskey, chocolate, coffee, maple, spicy alcohol. All of this changes and evolves as it warms. If you're lucky enough to try this, make this last an hour and wallow in its glory. 		M = Not quite the mouth of the regular Breakfast Stout, which is the pinnacle IMO. But very nice and thick, coating. Just not quite as chewy as the original. 		D = Maybe the exquisite taste makes this so drinkable. Despite its strength and complexity, I wanted to gun right through this one it was so good. 		Overall, a near perfect brew.";;;;;;;;;;
"Tasted nov. 12th 2011 (from notes)	 	A - beautiful copper/amber, almost no but very white head and no lacing	 	S - sweet yeast, sweet malts, very hoppy! Lots of citrus. Pineapple, grapefruit, very fresh and crisp. Beautiful bouquet. Smells velvety sweet	 	T - super hoppy! Tons of earth, wood, grassy, tons of bright spring and summer flowers, very nice slightly toasted malts, tons of very, very nice bitter. This ale is super crisp	 	M - medium body, medium acidity, medium complexity, semi balanced and long finish	 	D - super bitter, very nice but very bitter. Crisp, refreshing and very fresh everything. If you have had hoppy caldera stuff, this is for you!	 	Final thought - only $5 a pop and 7%! Get some of these. Enjoy ASAP!";;;;;;;;;;
pour is pinkish red with a pink/white head. somewhat clear. the head smells doughy to my surprise. mild cherry tart and stale chamomile tea with honey. the taste is a mild sweet with a, not a flemish red, tart. not to complex. this beer was rather herbal though and actually somewhat easy to drink. good body. a lot better than i expected. good with shrimp.;;;;;;;;;;
"Picked up a 32oz growler of this yesterday. Poured into Chimay chalice.		A - Poured clear a pinkish reddish color with slick lacing and overall wine cooler visual. The head was pink and frothy when poured into a unibroue tulip for my wife.		S - The nose was very soft. A bit of cherry a bit of vanilla, but not much else. Sweet and sour odor.		T - Cherry is in the front but very soft. Very much like drinking a blush wine.		M - Very juice like. Doesn't feel like beer at all. A bit sour and wine like.		D - Dangerously drinkable. Goes down like a fruit juice without much bite at all. Really enjoyed this one. My wife even went for a glass.";;;;;;;;;;
"As a avid beer drinker and bartender, I sample many of the beers which come into our bar. I must admit I like the bold taste of darker beers, but the Amstel light had a good smell and left no ""aftertaste"". I would regard it as a good beer overall.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pale and slightly hazy deep gold. Short head leaves no lacing. 		The smell is sweet for a dipa. Honey and caramel malts are supported by citrus hops. 		The hops are fresh tasting citrus- orange, mango, and grapefruit. It does have a strong sweet malt presence. 		Mouthfeel is slightly dry and clean. Alchohol is masked extremely well. 		A very good DIPA that, if I had regular access to, I would certainly put in rotation.";;;;;;;;;;
"4/20	Appearance - Hazy amber body topped with a thin, rapidly-fading, white head. Slight splotchy remnants of lace.	Smell - Floral, grapefruit.	Taste - Immediate burst of juicy grapefruit, followed by bitter, piney hops and some sweet malts, which help lend some contrasting flavors.	Mouthfeel - Creamy with a medium to full body and moderate carbonation.	Drinkability - For a 9.4% beer this is quite drinkable, but the intense hoppy nature of the beer can bring about palate fatigue. I'd say this is best enjoyed one beer at a time. Nonetheless, a very good DIPA worth seeking out to try.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle from by secret bunny poured into a snifter.		A-Body is a thick, viscous, opaque dark brown hue. Pours with a small medium brown foamy head that quickly fades to a very thin collar. Some traces of lacing remain at the top of the glass.		S-Potent. Phenols come through over a deep, complex RIS nose. I pick up anise, raisins, dark chocolate malt, and a touch of roastiness. All well balanced but the phenols are very much upfront and the highlight of the nose.		T-Upfront is a mix of dark fruit and anise upfront with a thick roasted dark malt backbone. The flavor gets slightly bitter for the finish as the roasted component of the malt comes through more but all the complexity remains all the way through. A big warm alcohol blanket lingers and wraps the initial flavors.		M-Medium to high prickly carbonation and smooth, thick viscous body underneath.		D- This brew certainly lines up with RIS and is a good example of the style. Exactly what I think when I think of RIS's. IMO, its also a step up from the other Founders stouts. This is good, but a pretty typical example of the style. ABV is high and somewhat prominent. Good beer overall that I would not hesitate to have again.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured a deep mahongany color, thick, creamy tan head that slowly receded into a nice thin creamy cap. Left thick lacing. Robust smell of roasted malt, caramel, coffee. A very robust flavor of roasted malt, a touch of smoke, touch of caramel, chocolate and earth. Full bodied, thick and oily texture, very soft carbonation, with a quick, dry pleasantly bitter finish. This is absolutely one of my favorite brews, dark, rich, thick, packs a punch and is robust in flavor. Founders did a great job with Dirty Bastard. They don't get much better than this.;;;;;;;;;;
"Home Run! 	Founders hit it out of the park with this one. Pours a raspberry red in color with some nice carbonation bubbles filling the top of the glass. Smell is tart raspberries. Taste is much the same. Amazing enough, I didn't tire of it by the end of the bomber. This is a very easy drinker, you get no hints of the 12.3% ABV. This was a real treat.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle poured into my brooklyn tulip		a-pitch black with a nice one and half finger head that stuck around for a while...tremendous lacing		s-coffee up front and sweet chocolate and prunes...		t-bitter chocolate and coffee up front with some roasted notes...nice toffee finish and nutty in the end		m-thick, oily, and viscous just like i like perfect		d-2 per night due to the abv but i would want to drink this all night its impecable		overall top notch another nice one from founders...i constantly impressed by those folks...one of my favorite ris";;;;;;;;;;
"Deep ruddy brown, not quite dark enough to block all the light, but there isn't much getting through. Solid two fingers of creamy head that seems to fall in the middle but hold tall at the edges.		Aroma is semi sweet, with a fairly soapy yeast aroma. Cherries seem to be faintly present and maybe some dark grapes. Not as much to the nose as many examples of this style.		Semi sweet, earthy and slightly tart at the finish. Certainly carries a bit of spices. Grapes seem to be well represented, but it isn't as fruity as the average Belgian Dark.		Medium bodied with fairly aggressive carbonation. This is a pretty reasonable beer, worth checking out, but isn't a star amongst the style.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a black body with a brown head that very quickly fizzles away to a thin brown lace.		Aroma smells of coffee beans, bourbon, chocolate, malt.		Taste a lot of bourbon and coffee right off the bat. Then, hints of chocolate and something very sweet like a syrup. After letting the beer settle I find the flavors come more together as it warms up. An incredibly tasty stout.		Mouthfeel is very impressive. Thick, but not too thick with a velvet like feel.		This beer is heavy and fills you up, also 11.20% so its not a beer you need to drink a whole lot of. Still though, you might find it hard to pass up another glass.		Overall this beer is one of the best stouts i'm yet to have.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass Best By 12/31/07		Pours a perfectly clear light copper in color with just shy of a finger of bone white head that leaves some decent lacing. Nice aroma, malty, namely Munich malts. No hop aroma, diacetyl, or esters. Flavor is definitely malt forward and fairly complex. There is some initial malty sweetness which is followed by some Munich/toasted malts. There is a pleasant hop bitterness that appears in the finish. Rather clean and crisp with just a bit of lingering bitterness. Good mouthfeel, medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Seems smooth and somewhat creamy but at times seems a bit slick in the finish. Overall this is a very enjoyable beer but seems more like a Vienna Lager than a marzen in appearance and body. This is an enjoyable fall seasonal that is certainly worth a try.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Dark amber/ruby, clear, slightly with a beautiful 3 finger head that really sticks		S: Smoked ham is most dominant but i also get other smoked meats like bacon. There is some nice bready malts also in the mix but the aroma is mostly smoked ham		T: Delicious smoked ham and pork. Some caramel, but mostly smoked ham.		M: Medium viscosity with some creaminess		D: One of these is all you need. Too intense for more		O: Probably my favorite from the brewery.";;;;;;;;;;
"A_Pours a hazy burnt orange. Sticky white head. Lacing coats the glass.		S_Heavy citrus,grapefruit,pine.		T_Lots of citrus up front. Grapefruit,orange and lemon zest. Floral hops. Slight hint of malt but this is a hop forward beer.		M_Full bodied and sticky on the lips.		D_Very.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: nut brown, creamy white head that forms a skim coat		Smell: smoky (obviously), very much like smoked pork: greasy and slightly metallic; some noble hops are evident but not prominant; tinny and some very faint fruity esters		Taste: predominantly smoky, with the same sort of tinny metallic character as in the nose; no bitterness, omly smoke		Mouthfeel: medium body, perhaps a little on the lighter side; little apparent carbonation; kind of flat and a little watery		This si the marzen's little brother. Not as agressive with the smoke, more subtle in every regard.";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at Vintage Estate Wine and Beer in Boardman, Oh.		A--Deep mahogony, nice beige head.		S--A lot going on in the nose, bourbon, vanilla/oak, maple, its all there, fabulous.		T--I thought the nose was great?! Wow, this is an early xmas gift for the palate. Starts with bourbon, then to that oak/vanilla, with some maple and just the slightest taste of coconut. Such a complex gem of a beer.		M--Smooth and silky, not overly carbonated...		D--Now THIS is what its all about. Truly an epic, world class beer by the best all around brewery I know of. Seek it out, its fantastic.";;;;;;;;;;
"from notes 12/18/10		A: pours clear golden yellow with a strong white lacing head. 	S: compared to others from this brew house, it is much less smoky, yet is still smoky with a little grainy malt. 	T: lighter smoke, more noticeable malt profile, and is lightly grainy. hops and smoke combine in the aftertaste. 	M: smooth and crisp. carbonation is good. 	D: would make for a good starter into the rauchbier style.";;;;;;;;;;
The color is copper with a tiny, light-brown head. The aroma is of dark, earthy malts with a touch of dark fruit. The taste is of earthy malts matched with a hazelnut-like flavor. A very light roasted taste is noted alongside the nuttiness. Hops provide an almost herbal taste in the finish. Overall, the taste isn't balanced enough and the different flavors don't mesh well enough to make this a great beer. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but drinkability is good. I'm sure there are better choices within this style.;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours pitch black, minimal whisp of a brown head that doesn't last. Lacing makes a purdy design, kinda like an orange cross-section. Smells like chocolate up front, some vanilla and oak in the back, minimal coffee, slight anise, but mostly chocolate. Taste is more complex; sweet malt up front that quickly changes to chocolate and coffee with a nice bitterness that cuts the sweet. Dark stone fruits covered in chocolate, dates, and dark bread. Mouthfeel is spot on for me, not cloyingly sweet and thick, but just about right- it could be a tad thicker. Carbonation is small but plentiful and carries this beer wonderfully.";;;;;;;;;;
This was the best beer I had at haymarket this round. The look is black with a dense malted brown whipped cream head. Smell is bready, smokey, and floral. The taste is charcoal, sweet, dark chocolate, and bitter with a sticky chewy mouthfeel. Perhaps a bit too bitter for the style and my tastes. Toning down the hops a bit and bringing it down to about 7-8% abv would put this one in the back of the net. I'm thinking with some slight modifications this could be a beer in line with one of the best, in my opinion, Guinness foreign extra stout. How's about a bitter and the lads and lasses can have a black and tan then?;;;;;;;;;;
Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip. This Imperial stout poured a thick, opaque black color with a one finger thick dark tan head that slowly faded away, leaving behind some excellent lace. The aroma consisted of creamy dark chocolate, vanilla, and some faint molasses notes. A very big, robust aroma. Beautiful!!! The flavor did not disappoint. Very roasty and chocolatey. There are also notes of coffee and spices. The mouthfeel was definately full-bodied and a bit oily. Very minimal carbonation. A very impressive Imperial stout from Hoppin Frog. Highly recommended!;;;;;;;;;;
"CAN you believe it?!? The CANQuest rolls along nicely. Now, for those may be arriving late to today's program, already well in progress, I not only review the beers, but I also transcribe the verbiage so that you do not have to. 		I thought that Ska was very clever: It's [Modus Hoperandi] label read: ""Walk, Kite, Recycle, Hide, Seek, Plant, Recycle, Grow, Shower, HHH, Tube, Recycle."" 		But now, from this one's exterior: "" 'Live Product. Keep Cool. Just Like You."" Yeah, man. How many times have my students heard me say, ""Be cool, baby. Be real cool.""? Innumerable. A ring around the neck read ""Go Biking ... Go Rafting ... Go CANS! ... Go Skiing ... Go Fishing ... Go Snowboarding ... www.calderabrewing.com"". 		It reminds me of the joke of the financially strapped male children looking for something to do on a hot summer's day. They pool their limited resources and send one of their number to the local grocer's, only to have him return with a box of tampons. Incredulous at this purchase, one of them inquires as to his choice. His response: ""Well, the box reads, 'With this product, you can go swimming, camping, fishing and a whole host of fun activites'."" Har!		Yeah, me, I'm going to skip all of that fun stuff with the exception of ""Go CANS!"" Here we go, CANS, here we go!		A friend of mine in the industry remarked that he feels that the days of generic ""Amber"" beers have passed. I disgree, but let's see how this stacks up.		The finger-and-a-half of head was light-tan with good retention. Remember that ""Live Product"" jazz? Well, it had a slight haze to its deep-amber color suggestive of the presence of yeast. CAN-conditioned?!? Holy Drop the Corks and Cages, Batman! Gee, the nose smelled nothing like an amber of yore. Instead, I got a whiff of piney hops, a scent of malty sweetness, even a slight black pepper smell. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a caramel-malt taste that I would expect on the tongue. The finish, however, was both piney and peppery on the extreme, lingering finish. Initially, I got the same caramel sweetness, but it became overwhelmed. Yow! How many more CANs of this do I have left? Somebody said that they have distribution in MD ... Bye!";;;;;;;;;;
"If you change your own oil and don't take the easy way out by going to Jiffylube or something, you'll recognize the pour as dirty motor oil. A nice brown head seals the deal sitting like a crown atop the head of a king. Body is completely black and if you were hoping to catch a glimpse of something from the other side of this opaque liquid you will surely be saddened. 		Nose is like a baseball bat to the face of lovely vanilla and sharp alcohol. There's also some roasted coffee bean at the tail end. Very nice. 		Taste is huge on the bourbon. Lots of vanilla, chocolate, espresso, roastiness and a dry finish. This is wonderful. A nice mix of the stout I want to taste and the bourbon that should accentuate it. 		Mouth is slick and oily. Thick as if something was added to thicken it. It feels as if there are layers to it somehow. 		I could see myself buying this again and again. This is a true gem.";;;;;;;;;;
Pretty impressed with this one overall....straw colored....very little head...aroma is very light (strained grains)..;;Nice body on this one though....medium and well rounded...;;Taste is moderately bready...malty....just enough hop on the finish to make it clean and crisp..;;For a regular old lager this is quite good...wish Miller could put this into their MGD cans...much better than Heineken etc...;;I will have to look into this beer a little more in the summer months...;;
"A-Pours a slightly hazy honey amber w/a hint of orange-pink. Light tracing remains, and the head did not last long, but it is still hanging on. Small beads of carbonation rise and hug the edges of the glass.	S-Bitter almond, mango, peach, light sweet malt, orange, light coriander, nutmeg, light yeast. Honestly, the first smell didn't do much for me, but it was very different. Each subsequent aromatic sampling brought forth something new, and 	T-Very fruity upfront with a residual and pleasant sweetness; midway the bitter almond emerges, and a light spiciness reveals itself just after. The finish is of light hops, dough, and a final light zing of citrus. Crisp and even.	M-Excellent mouthfeel and variability throughout the drinking experience. I feel all sorts of sensations and flavors that work very well, and that are unique. The bitter almond pleasantly coats the mouth beyond the finish, and marries well with the citrus. The fruit is potent, but the sweetness is well-restrained. This ale is well-balanced and even.	D-Very enjoyable. I will definitely buy again. Something like this is refreshing in summer as a session brew, and also exhibits autumnal traits like the spiciness and fruit that make it nice to drink this time of year.";;;;;;;;;;
"500ml bottle poured into a Mill St. pint glass. 		It's difficult to add to what others have already written for this beer I find, but I'll do a quick run down and add personal touches best I can. 		A: dark red amber, clear when held up to the light. Nice light tan head that stick around and leaves some spider web lacing. 		S: Yep. Smoked pork. Others have written ham, or smoked salmon, but I think double smoked maple bacon. 		T: More bacon! This time though the there's a bready taste going on. Sweet in the middle, but ONLY in the middle. The smoke comes back and there is a lingering breadiness. 		M: Medium, but like the taste, there a bready yeastiness that takes over the smoke in the middle. 		D: Really good, but slow at first I find. You certainly can't crush this beer no matter how familiar you are with smoke beers. The sweetness and the smokiness demand (I think) that you sip it. 		I drank this on its own. And I'd like to try it paired with some spicy food. 		I was once at a fancy shmantsy Indian restaurant, and ordered a curried lamb shank. The waiter suggested a smoked Shiraz from India to pair it with. At first I was put off (not knowing much about smoked drinks at the time) and it turned out to be perfect. That's something I'd like to try this with. The sweetness of this beer (and I loves me sweet beers!) needs to be balanced with something spicy, I think. Or maybe some intense German food like a good Bratwurst with spicy saurkraut...just thinking...";;;;;;;;;;
Less than impressive head sits atop a slightly darker than expected golden body, with lovely champagne bubbles rising to the top. Smell is crisp, with a notable presence of Saaz. As for the flavor, this is far from the most complex beer I've ever tasted, but more complex than I expected with a touch of smokiness in the malt, which is a brilliant compliment to the noble hop. Mouth is entertained, nay, delighted, and then it vanishes. I've seldom had a cleaner finishing beer, that left me wanting more more (yes, I meant to say more more) than this.;;;;;;;;;;
"Picked up a bottle of this to knock of the elusive black & tan style. Served in my Pisgah pint glass.		A - Two fingers of mocha foam with solid retention and a bit of spotty lacing. The brew is a dark, dark, brown that lightens towards the edges. For those expecting the typical half back, half tan, this is going to be a little disappointing, but otherwise it's pretty solid.		S - The smell reminds me a little of Iniquity, with a mix of roasty chocolate and piney hoppiness. I actually get a pretty even distribution of the two flavors, and found myself waffling about what was more prevalent each time I raised the glass. There's something about the two aromas that don't quite blend nicely; it's almost as if they are doing battle. There's also a mildy acidic note that I get that I don't really enjoy.		T - The taste is definitely roast malt and chocolate and less hoppy. Perhaps this is an older bottle (no dates), but I expected more from something that was 2/3 IPA. The hops that do come through are earthy and floral. It's really not all that far from something like Sweetwater Happy Ending. I actually like the taste more than the smell, as it seems to blend better.		M - Medium body with quite a bit of carbonation burn on the upper lip, dry finish with roasty bitterness (the hop bitterness doesn't really make it through). This blend loses B.O.R.I.S.'s amazing creaminess, which is quite unfortunate.		D - With all my complaints, it's still pretty easy to drink - the only really big knock is the overcarbonation. 		I think it's silly to bottle pre-blended black & tans. I'd rather make my own combos and get the delightful split coloration. This brew is less than the sum of its parts.";;;;;;;;;;
"From Saturday, March 31 session notes:		Poured a 22oz. bomber into a tankard.		A: Pours opaque dark brown with a pinky-thick tan head.		S: Strong cascade hops.		T and M: Goes down thick and smooth with a full complement of roasted malt finished with decently strong bittering hops. I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect with mixing an IPA with a stout but the result is pretty good. There&#8217;s an interesting tug-of-war between citrusy flavors from the IPA and roasted malt from the stout.		D: A good night cap.		Recommended.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours an opaque mahogany amber with a faint head that disappears quickly. Pours almost like syrup.	Aroma will change with ever degree that it warms. Ripe bananas...vanilla...rum....bourbon...sweet and complex.	Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a nice ...no, wonderful warmth as you swallow.	Taste...ahhh...everything you smell along with some dark sweet fruits...plums...again vanilla, rum, boubon. Again, sweet and complex. As it warms even more ripe banana and rum and boubon flavors. Amazing. The oak or bourbon barrel aging done on this beer definitely works and works perfectly. All of the vanilla sweetness and richness you would expect from that is here and then some.	Aftertaste is chewy dark fruits and alcohol warmth.	Many thanks to CRJMellor for this trade.	EDIT:	Just had a second bottle of this on Nov 10th, 2006.	Everything that I found in the first except noticed a smokiness to the aromas this time I didn't note the first time.	This is an extremely complex Old Ale...sweeter than most and I love it.";;;;;;;;;;
"This is a very good porter. My first from Hoppin Frog and certainly a fine enough attempt to warrant several more. Most notably, there is a strong coffee aroma, as well as a notably smokey aftertaste. One of the smoother porters as well. Pours with a healthy head and pitch black. Fairly thick, but about average for a porter, certainly not overbearing. A fine balance of taste and the alcohol is understated.		Worth your time.";;;;;;;;;;
"Belgian brews can sometimes be real sugar bombs, but I noted that Founders kept the sugar from leaping over the top of the brew. Bad Habit poured a lovely, rust-like color with a fair head. Scent opened up quickly into sweet and mildly spicy and with a bit of alcohol.		Flavor was candy-like and fruity, but the touch of spice I smelled at the pour carried into the flavor profile, somewhat balancing everything out. I also noted a zing from the hops in the background and in the very long finish.		This limited-edition beer is certainly worth a try.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to hopdog for this one....coincidentally, I think I liked this one much more than Steve.	Appears a dark amber with a small white cap that fades out slowly. Spotty bits of lacing are left around the glass.	Smell is of caramel, herbal hops, with grapefruit, and pine jumping out.	Taste is of bitter herbal hops, earthiness, fruity yeast, and vanilla.	Mouthfeel is medium bodied, bitter, with caramel and hops being well balanced. Slightly thin finish.";;;;;;;;;;
"Ok - from the pour you know this is a fruit beer that's not playing around. Light red raspberry color with pink hues and a small pinkish white head. Not much retention and very little lacing. Lighter in color than Lindeman's Framboise Lambic, but more color than any other fruit beers (excluding those delicious fruit stouts & porters).		Upfront raspberry aroma and a hint of alcohol. Mild malt sweetness mixes well with the fruit and does give off the disconnected graininess of typical fruit beers.		Again, raspberry dominates but not too overpowering. Wonderful sweet-tart flavors provide the right about of tangy sourness. Light bitterness towards the end, along with a dose of some alcohol spice. Finishes with lingering raspberry, sweet malt, a hint of spicy hop.		Medium bodied, smooth and crisp with low carbonation. Finishes dry and surprisingly refreshing and drinkable. Great drinkability, but as with many fruit beers it can get tired. 		A special beer and one of the best in the fruit category. This beer does not play - you want raspberry, here is raspberry!";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a ""stubby"" 12oz. bottle into a wine goblet.	Deep, copper/gold in color, with a very short head of foam. Lots of suspended sediment that doesn't settle, even after a few minutes. Curious, but not a deterrent.	Aroma-Faint, but certain whiff of bourbon, definite hop note.	Taste-Sweet-tinged bourbon and barleywine mix. Maple syrup sweetness, bourbon heat, fruity hop notes, leading to a bit of a medicinal finish. Thick and chewy, smooth and strong with a belly-warming finish. I would have liked to try a more fresh version for comparison as my bottle was over a year old. 	Overall, pretty nice for an aged bottle, but all the suspended sediment was a bit distracting and may have affected the taste.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tumbler glass.		Appearance: Hazy bright yellow with a big white head.		Smell: Lots of hops. Grapefruits and lemons.		Taste: Despite the big hop aroma, hops are kind of light in the flavor. Grapefruit is present.		Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation when drank from the bottle. Significantly lighter carbonation in the glass.		More like an IPA than a pale ale in my opinion, but it's still a damn fine beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Picked up the founders variety case, this has to be one of the best out there. First up is the Red's Rye PA		Poured from the bottle to pint glass, appears an amber with coppery hues and nice creamy head that dissipated but laced well.		Smell is a kick of piney/citrusy hops with the soury scent of the rye with a hint of caramel sweetness.		Taste is a great blend of caramely malt and rye front with the hop flavor not as potent as the scent but a great blend.		Mouthfeel is great, well balanced, flavors hit the top of the tongue well and the carbonation is just enough throughout.		This is a highly drinkable beer, just a bit to bitter for more than 2 or 3, but great tasting, done very well.";;;;;;;;;;
"pours slightly murky brown with some purple tinting. a small eggshell colored head quickly recedes to a thin film, yet laces well.		aroma is strongly dominanted by the bourbon. plenty of vanilla, oak, maple. next some scotch ale aromas provide some toffee, nougat, and molasses. smells rich and delicious.		flavor starts actually very fruity with raisins, dates, sweetened dried cherries. vanilla comes next and is supported by some woody earthiness, oak, and pure maple syrup. some dark caramel, toffee, butterscotch (pun intended), brown sugar and a lot of warming, yet pleasant booze. very nice.		very syrupy body with just a touch of carbonation, and a touch of harsh alcohol throughout and lingering.		drinks pretty well for a beer as strong and bourbon-heavy. one in a night is plenty to warm me up, though. one of my favorite winter beers!";;;;;;;;;;
"Dark, rich, mahogany in color with a slight haze. Strong firm head that persisted and left a nice lace. 		Smokey, smokey, smokey (surprise, right?). Hints of pork and hickory. The smoke doesn't let any other aromas threw in the smell. 		Smoke hits your first, but with a bite, and a thick nice toasted coffee follows. Hints of nuts. Bready finish. Smoke persist throughout, but accent the other flavors very well. 		Thick and full bodied, high carbonation. Spreads very nicely around the mouth. Thick like a porter. 		Smoky as anything could imagine, but the other flavors really balance well with it and make it very drinkable. So good, I just had to order another. 		Best smoky beer, and smokiest, I've ever had and I'm sad being an ocean away from having it on tap.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours: Like the darkest layer of espresso; jet black and unabashedly so. A slight ring if espresso brown colored head quickly dissipates to the edge of the glass and floats on top like a soapy thin layer.		Nose: Citrus orange rhind, slight mint, toffee, caramel malt and big, bright hops, hops that punch you in the face and choke you out like an MMA fighter.		Taste: Citrus hops slap you in the face while burnt toffee, caramel malt and slightly bitter chocolate round things out into a near perfect blend. I just had a ruination before this but Nemesis is almost bigger and brighter than the stone hops. 		Mouthfeel: Creamy, not too thick or watery. The taste sticks on your palate well after the beer is gone.		Overall: Surprisingly amazing but Founders continues to impress me. I've had four of their beers and all have truly astounded me. They are an amazing brewery. This is amazing at a relatively fresh age but it'd be interesting to see a less hoppy version though I don't know if it'd be as good as it is now.";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap poured into 1/2 pint glass at the St Matthew's location.		Poured an Amber brown with a nice head. Smell of sweet dark fruit, bourbon, caramel. Taste the same as it smells with a very pleasant vanilla bourbon addition to the British ale. Mouthfeel is smooth and mild. Even at 8.8% ABV it's very drinkable if I didn't have to drive home.";;;;;;;;;;
"Paid $5.99 for a 22 oz. Menacingly, rich, deep, black with a dark brown head. I've had my share of stouts, but never have I seen one this dark and rich looking. Good dense head, nice brown lacing like caramel spiderwebs. Nose shows coffee, roast barley - great balance with hops in the background. Taste is superb. Heavy oats, coffee, roasted barley, black barley, hop bitterness counters well the sweetness of unfermented gravity. 		Mouthfeel is what sets this stout apart. It's almost chocolate milk, so thick. Coats the tongue, but doesn't stick. Carbonation is present, but very soft. Beautiful.		I'm floored by Hoppin' Frog. Glad they've showed up. I'll be trying more of their beers from now on.";;;;;;;;;;
"I'm a big fan of Yazoo as one of Nashville's few local brews and the only one focusing on brewing rather than brewpubbing, and I'm a big fan of Hefe's. I find the Yazoo Hefe to be an excellent example of the variety. The flavor of cloves dominates in this brew and isn't nearly as citrusy as some other hefe's I've had. The beer finish clean and goes down easy. I have had a few bad Yazoo Hefe's that tasted stale and nearly undrinkable, but I'll chalk those up to bad luck as the majority have been outstanding		The Hefeweizen is now available in bottles, so I'll have to give that a shot and see how it does.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a Duvel tulip.		Pours a dark, dark ruby. If the head were not there, I'd think it's a red wine. You'd think it was black until you see the pink tinged head, which settles to a thick layer with nice foam floating around. Nice lacing.		Huge raspberry concentrate up front on the nose. Smells very sweet, maybe a touch of tartness. Belgian yeast. Smell is one dimensional, but wonderful if you love raspberries.		Again, up front is a huge, tart raspberry presence. Tons of raspberries. This is followed by sweet alcohol, which is a little off putting. It finishes with Belgian yeast, some lemon zest, tart, and dry.		Mouth feel is full bodied and even a little syrupy, which again makes me think raspberry concentrate. Well carbonated.		Overall, this was way more over the top raspberry than I expected. It's a sipper because of the combination of alcohol and tartness. That being said, raspberries are one of my favorite fruits so I'm enjoying the hell out of this.";;;;;;;;;;
"This is actually 9%, not 7.5% (as the description says at the time of my writing.) A beer named Sue - dressed in a black label and black cap (just like the Nashville legend in whom's honor this was made.) White ""SUE"" on the label in the same font as ""CASH"" on Johnny Cash's last several albums. Ok, to the beer...		Appearance - dark, dark opaque brown, almost black. Very little head which quickly disappears.		Smell - Lots of smoke and malt, very nice		Taste - SMOKE, SMOKE, and more SMOKE! There is no doubt that this is a smoked porter, but it is nicely balanced by some chocolate and maybe a hint of coffee. Lots of complexity. One would never think this was a 9% brew.		Mouthfeel - Not bad. Little carbonation - medium body, solid.		Drinkability - For a 9% beer, this is amazing. Very sessionable. I'll be giving this as a gift to many this holiday season. Very proud of my hometown brewery (and, for the record, I don't love everything Yazoo does, but they nailed this one.)";;;;;;;;;;
"2011, poured into a snifter		Appearance- Pours jet black with a small tan head. Good retention and impressive lacing.		Smell- Chocolate, coffee and roasted malts up front, with a bit of piney hops lying underneath.		Taste- Again, chocolate and coffee lead things off. Mixed in with some caramel, licorice, and subtle dark fruits. Cocoa and a very slight smokiness. A semi bitter pine pops up towards the finish. Lingering dark chocolate on the palate, slightly boozy as well.		Mouthfeel- Full body, ample carbonation. ABV is noticeable, but hid well overall. Very smooth.		Overall- What more can you say, another excellent stout from Founders, they flavors stay with you long after the drink.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours an orangish, hazy amber color with two fingers of foamy head. Great retention. Citrus and floral notes dominate the nose. Nice bready maltiness and solid citrusy, piny, floral hops. Great balance. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with just the right carbonation.		Nice, complex IPA that's easily drinkable.";;;;;;;;;;
I poured into my glass to a finger of brown head. This beer is black. The head looks pretty thick. This is one sexy looking beer. The aroma is just about every dark scent you can imagine: chocolate, coffee, molasses, licorice, and some alcohol. The taste is alcohol forward at first. As the offering warms up it recedes with the bakers cocoa and coffee coming to the forefront. The taste is slightly bitter, but not too much. The mouthfeel is nice and viscous. This is a beer that I have been eying in the fridge for several months now. It was well worth the wait.;;;;;;;;;;
"Got this from hopscrazy! Thanks Brian!!!		A- Nice heady pour into a tulip glass! Two fingers of deep tan foam that fades fairly quickly and leaves a nice oily lacing all over! Jet black like coffee with the only light shining thru near the foamy head. 		S- Raisins, dark roasted espresso, and a fine 70% chocolate bar! Really nutty and delicious... perhaps even a touch of barnyard? Very refined with a ton of depth... yet somehow simple as a classic porter should be! 		T- A mouthfull of Mocha Iced coffee... gets even better as it warms up. A touch of smoke and roasted nuts. Subtle dried fruits and a hint of bitter hops. The chocolate and fruit really come thru at the end and coat the tongue!		M- Really nice coffee/cocoa/hop bitterness that has a sweet backbone! Not as thick as a Porter can be... yet not as thin as some Porters can are! Each sip leaves you NEEDING more!!! Just a hint of booze! I'd love to have a bourbon barrel version of this so that maybe some vanilla would blast your mouth as well!		O- A damn fine porter indeed!!! I wish I could get this in NY! Great balance! Great play between all the sences! Roasty, nutty, raisiny, chocolatey, coffee'(LOL).";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass... hazy golden yellow color with a thing fizzy white head. The head barely lasted a minute before dissipating. 		The aroma is nice, malty, a little citrus flavor... very impressed after the less than impressive appearance. 		The citrus flavor dominates the taste up front... a little sour lemon on the tongue at the end of each sip. It's not bad, but not as balanced as it could be. 		The mouthfeel is average... nothing special but this is definitely a drinkable beer. Light and refreshing and could make for a decent summer session beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Amberversary, seasonal, Cannon Brewpub, 6.5%abv		This is claimed to be a cross between their amber ale and their IPA. It is less hoppy than their IPA, but is still more like an American IPA than anything else. I've had other American IPAs that are similarly hopped, therefore put it in the AmIPA style.		A Nice thick head, nice lacing. Head stayed around for the whole glass. Amber red in color, clear filtered. A beutiful beer.		S Smells flowery and citrusy. Hops overwhelm any other aromas that may be present, but then that's probably the point and acceptable to me.		T Nice malty flavor comes through the hops. Balance is unmistakenly toward the hops. A little sweetness at the front then fades to bitter at the back. Hopping is not over the top and less than some AmIPAs and it results in a easy drinking amber. Very good.		M Medium body, carbonation is good, alcohol warmth is not detectable.		O A very nice drinking beer. I could have several of these. Nice looking, great smelling, not overwhelming, just a nice to drink beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours an attractive golden yellow. Fuzzy thin white head that quickly dissipates to a rim. Some scattered lacing. 		Mouthfeel is thin, but not overly watery. The smell is a bit offputting. I actually can't put a name to the aroma. There's some piney hops in the background, but there' something else going on here.		The taste has that weird aroma deal mixed in as a flavor. Again, I can't tell what it is. Almost like an acrid aftertaste. When I saw ""dry hopped"", I thought this might end up being more like an IPA than a Pale Ale, but it's a fairly typical example of the style. There's some pine in there. No real tropical or sweet notes, and I don't taste much malt.		Decent, except for that weird aftertaste/smell I can't identify.";;;;;;;;;;
"Wow! Yet another hoppy US brew to find it's way to Oz via David Logdson. Did I say you rock? Anyways, excitement plus, shared with ScottDog and Tits. I'd read a few reviews on this brew via BA before sampling, so I was well aware of it's hoppy goodness.		The TG IPA poured a pale orange into the oversized wine glasses, with a thin (1cm) slightly off white head, that left plenty of lacing on the glass as I sipped. Nicely unfiltered, with a hint of yeast cloud.		Aroma: Wow! a huge hop aroma, blasting me, bigger than any Australian made IPA I can think of at the moment. Big malt, citrus, piney hops, alcohol warmth(?), and more crystal malt.		Tasted wonderful, I could definately drink a few of these. Sadly we only got 1 to share. Huge malt, biscuity, balanced with the exceptional hop bitterness and lingering hop flavour. Hints of the 6.7% abv, more malt and a dry finish, with plenty of hop in the aftertaste. You really know you're drinking a well amde beer here.		Again, why can't Aussie brewers make beer like this. There are the exceptions (Wig & Pen, JS Brewhouse), but there needs to be more of these gorgeous hoppy creations.		Brew Before Dishonour!";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Pours a dark, oily black body with a full, mocha-colored head.		Smell: A pungent aroma overflowing with coffeebeans - some whole, some even ground for a drip machine. Attempting to peak through is some dry, dark bakers chocolate.		Taste: Semi-sweet chocolate maltiness soon yields to the more dominant coffee flavor which is much akin to a cold day-old cup of morning coffee. Some faint citrusy hops join the finish as it warms. Unfortunately, I find that the coffee character tramples unforgivingly over the other lesser flavors of chocolate, oatmeal, charred caramel and smoky cigars. 		Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, with a sofy, velvety mouthfeel. Softly carbonated.		Drinkability: Ultimately, I prefer coffee stouts to allow the other softer undertones to shine through a bit more.";;;;;;;;;;
"Big props to RickSawyer for this one.		Pours out like motor oil on its 6,0000th mile, mmm. Be wary of the formidable that awaits it's release, close to three fingers of nice dark tan head with nice lacing down the glass throughout. Smell is of all the ingredients listed on the label.Tingles the mouth with what feels like bit of hops but that fades as soon as it makes its way down my throat. (I'm puzzled by this because the IBUs are only 25 and it doesn't seem like enough to be assert itself here). Heavy on roasted chocolate then transitions to coffe. Really painfully good. Aftertaste is slightly sweet and makes the tongue tingle and come to life. I really really like this beer. Someone please send me some!!";;;;;;;;;;
A bottle conditioned DIPA which pours frothy, comes out a dirty water yellow, and tastes strongly of citrus hops. This is a great DIPA for Indian food (duh) as the flavor can come through the heat of the meal. Not overly bitter, but a big beer without being chewy, this is one I would see again, especially if I was serving a searingly-spicy dish and needed a beer to stand up to it.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. The bottle reads ""50 IBU's"" and ""10.2%"" around the top of the bottle's neck label. Appearance is a semi-translucent dirty dark brown with a thick foamy head of light tan that is a full two fingers high before slowly falling back to a moderate ring of lace. Aroma is rich, full of oakiness and vanilla, bourbon comes through strong. Also notes of earthy grains and smokiness, sweet dark fruits also present. The taste opens with a big warming bourbon flavor that makes a transition to the vanilla and smoky oak flavors, buttery diacteyl notes, slightest hint towards the big abv% which this beer hides quite well. Aftertaste is lightly sweet but clean. Mouthfeel is silken-smooth, lightly carbonated with a medium body, syrupy in texture, coats the mouth and throat. Drinkability is outstanding for a 10% brew, you are tempted to follow one with another as wonderful as this beer is. This is a beer you sit and sip quietly to appreciate; I would suggest limiting it to one of these per sitting. Easily one of my top ten, highly recommend trying, definitely worth the higher price tag.";;;;;;;;;;
"Served from a 22oz. bottle, acquired via trade with jlindros (thanks man), into my North Coast snifter (11/23/09) at an appropriate temperature. 		A: Pours burnt golden orange capped off with a creamy 1.5 finger head that fades quickly leaving a bit of lacing. 		S: Sweet malty aroma combined with bitter hops containing citrus and pine. 		T: Certainly a more malt-forward DIPA, but quite pleasant in its own respect. Semi-sweet malt comprised of caramel and a slight burnt sugar. The hops are mainly pine flavored in nature with a moderate citrus twang. 		M: A fuller-bodied beer with appropriate carbonation and a well hidden 8.2% abv.		D: Good drinkability, but I prefer a slightly more citrus dominated hops in my DIPAs.		Overall this beer was an above average DIPA with a very nice malt backbone, but lacked a bit of flavor in the hops department. Thanks again Jared. Recommended for malt-forward DIPA fans.";;;;;;;;;;
"I've had a bottle of this sitting in the cellar for a couple months, purchased from Founder's itself. The notch indicates it was bottled in March 2008, so it's a recent edition.		Decanted into a pint glass. Pours a clear, rich honey-orange color. Thick, foamy white head that descends in a consistent layer. Not much lacing. But the beer is very appealing.		Smell starts with a piny, citrusy swell of hops, but there's a decent maltiness to off-set it. Some caramel grains.		Flavors really travel well. It starts with a big honey, caramel malty blast - not what you'd expect from a Triple IPA. There's a strong dash of the piny hops in the middle of the tongue, and then that fades. Then, about five seconds later, the aftertaste kicks in a HUGE wallop of hops. There's your 200+ IBUs! Pretty fun experience.		Mouthfeel is moderately thick. Goes perfectly with the rich maltiness and big hops.		This is an interesting beer. At first it hints at a big West Coast hoppiness, but it's balanced out nicely with some bold sweet flavors. For a beer that boasts high IBUs, it's really a dynamic beer, not one that just rakes your palate with extreme hoppiness.";;;;;;;;;;
"200th review - Received as an extra from iceicebaby (thanks again Sean). Served in my DFH snifter. Poured a dark, opaque brown. Quarter-inch tan-colored head subsided into a slick of foam with a solid ring around the shoulders. Jagged peaks and valleys of lacing, but adherence is somewhat spotty. Smell is decadent. Lots of coffee and molasses up front with a warm bourbon quality in the background. Dark fruit is revealed as the snifter warmed in my hand. Flavors offer a nice and balanced blend of the qualities presented in the nose. Coffee is roasty without tasting burnt or astringent. Cocoa flavors are detected as well. Bourbon character is complementary rather than over-assertive. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and silky up front; not at all viscous. A little chalky, but not unpleasantly so. Alcohol is fairly well-hidden and quite drinkable. A great brew to celebrate my 200th review.";;;;;;;;;;
22 oz bottle was about $16 at The Keg in Clarksville, Indiana. Pours a slightly hazed garnet body with a small and soapy pink head. A few flecks of lace are left on the goblet. Aroma is earthy yeasty mushrooms and lots of raspberries. Taste mirrors the aroma, with lots of tart raspberries and some earthy yeast. Alcohol is miraculously hidden except for a slight warmth. Very drinkable for such a large fruit beer.;;;;;;;;;;
Nice and dark on the pour with a small head. Mild roasty aroma - nothing too overpowering.;;A light coffe taste - maybe a bit watery. Medium carbonation - a bit of a fizz to the tongue.;;An easy drinking beer with nothing standing out too much - nothing bad and nothing stupendous.;;;;;;
Pours into the glass with a deep tan head on top of solid black liquid. Features a complex coffee and cocoa nose with an oatmeal background. The thick luxurious mouthfeel offers flavors of dark chocolate, more coffee and hoppy bitterness tempered with smooth oatiness. Finishes complex and wonderfully bittersweet. The aftertaste just goes on and on, one of the truly great stouts!;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours jet-black, thick like motor oil. Cocoa powder colored head, starts off thin but quickly billows out. Looks like chocolate milk, sticks to itself but still leaves some cool lacing. Smells like harsh instant coffee, coffee extract personified. Kind of a bran smell also, if bran had a real distinctive smell.		First impression: Lots and lots of coffee. When I burp it still tastes like coffee. Dark chocolate also is present, except it's not a real bitter dark chocolate, it's very in tune to the rest of the beer. A lot sweeter than I had imagined it would be. Just the barest hint of hops at the end, but this still trends towards the sweet side (for a big stout). has an oatmeal like smoothness to it, smooth but still a little sticky, doesn't quite have that velvety feel. Big, slick yet coating, without a ton of carbonation. In this case, it works. Maybe a little thin, not quite as all-enveloping that I had hoped. But it had big expectations to live up to. Super smooth and infinitely drinkable. Not hands down the greatest stout I've had so far, but it lives up to the hype. I could drink this forever.";;;;;;;;;;
"A clouded straw-colored body gives rise to a huge and sticky off-white head. 	This brings a lot of floured sourdough in the nose for something boasting fresh hops. Given time it gathers a domineering persona of pine needles, mint leaves, sea salt, and grass.	It enters the mouth with a steady shortbread maltiness that gathers towards white grapes over time (but never gets there). Hops add a variety of pepper, mint, and evergreen. But for what it is, they never truly assert themselves, even though this is one of the most compulsively drinkable hop combinations I've come across. It's mostly salty, and thus assures rapid drinking. The malt never supports a body that can support the hops. 	From a rating standpoint, it's dry and hoppy and drinkable, and virtually uninteresting aside from that.	The mouthfeel is equally peppered with CO2. It's a bit rasping and abrasive. And never settles down.	This is a very decent APA, but it is that and nothing more (and quite salty as such). Don't let your hopes run higher than that.	I feel like I'm overrating it...I like it. But it's a far cry from stuff like Great Divide's Fresh Hop Harvest Ale.";;;;;;;;;;
"This is an awesome beer....the amarillos are put to good use as this has a fantastic juicy citrus aroma..sweet citrus...almost like citrus style candies....I've been smelling this for about 2 minutes straight and I can detect a slight spicy rye note as well but it is very, very subtle...		The taste is where the rye really adds an awesome dimension to this very hop forward juicy ale..but its not just the rye..there is some real multidimensional character to this beer...light notes of caramel as well....finishes spicy and somewhat dry.		This is a great beer. Had this with a BBQ last week and I ended up drinking three of them because they were sliding down so much...I just couldn't put the glass down....tonight as I review it I have similar thoughts....great beer....I have the new Tyranena Rye Bitter woman and I am saving the last one of these to try side by side with that one..";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a clear glass snifter. No freshness date. Purchased as 4-pack at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $10.25.		A: Totally opaque black with tan edges and short cap of tan head with a few spots of lace.		S: Plenty of dark chocolate and coffee but a ton of leafy, tobacco-ish hops come through with big toasted malts		T: The taste is very bitter but cut nicely with more sweet than bitter chocolate. The leafy hops still play a huge role in the slightly but not unpleasantly acrid finish.		M: The mouthfeel is smooth generally except that the finish is a bit astringent. Carbonation is really low and it has a really nice coating, viscous quality that is good but not too much.		D: Deadly good drinkability and superior quality. Not a surprise given the huge love this brew gets, but I still think I like Expedition Stout and Ten Fidy a little more.		12/5/2009: At 3 months, the tobacco nature of the hops has faded and the chocolate and coffee character is gaining some steam.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from bottle to Boulevard Smokestack tulip. Really happy to find O'Fallon on the shelves in KC again. Having lived blocks away from this brewery for 2 years, it's a sentimental favorite. Bottled 8/24/2011 per julian stamp on bottle.		A: Chestnut and slightly hazy. An off-white head dissipates quickly but sticks around. Not much lacing.		S: Very nice aroma of pumpkin, brown sugar, and cinnamon.		T: Slightly bready malt with pumpkin, pumpkin rind, cinnamon, nutmeg, burnt sugar, and coriander. Nice flavor. 		M: Medium-bodied with an interesting consistency. Dexterous but not chunky. The slightest of hops bitterness at the finish.		O: An enjoyable pumpkin ale. I feel the Schlafly Pumpkin Ale is much superior as far as the local offerings go, but this one is more drinkable and better suited for sitting around the fire pit while passing out candy to trick-or-treaters.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle		Pours a pale golden yellow color with an enormous white head that goes vertical still after passing the rim of the glass. Big nose of fresh fruity hops, lots of piney/citrus juiciness as well as some strawberry and melon notes, very nice. Big hop flavor as well, 70 IBUS packs a very large punch when the freshness of the hops put on display. Its not overly bitter either just lots of clean, grassy hops for you to drool over. Light and crisp medium body, very well carbonation and quaff-able i had 2 before dinner last night and wished i had more in the fridge! I highly recommend for the the hop heads!";;;;;;;;;;
"at the lizard		i'm in love with the black rye so i was excited to give the red one a taste		pours a garnet with amber highlights and a feeble head (could be the glass, i suppose). NW hop aroma...smelled like someone had actually put hop pellets into my glass. i'm not sure if i would have picked up on the rye if i didn't know to look for it; subtle, but i did find it		medium mouthfeel		not what i had hoped for given my afinity for the black one";;;;;;;;;;
"Sold as a 16 Fl. Oz. Pint Glass as ""McGillin's Genuine Lager"" at cGillin's Olde Ale House		A: This beer has a nice golden color and a inch of white head		S: This beer has a mix of citrus, peppers, grains and grass smells to it		T: This beer a nice tates of citrus and spices, which comes from the finest imported 2-row malt and German noble hops		M: This beer goes down smooth		O: This is a beer that I will drink over and over again";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a clear rich mahogany in color with a bit over a finger of tan head. Aroma is dominated by a nice smoky character that is moderately strong and is at times reminiscent of bacon. There is a good malt presence in the background. Taste is much like the aroma. The character is mostly smoky with malty and toasty undertones. The character of this beer is fairly reminiscent of a marzen with some nice smoky aroma and flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty good with medium body and moderate-high carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. Overall this beer is easy to drink with great complexity and plenty of flavors to keep things interesting.;;;;;;;;;;
".5L emptied into a Pokal. 		A: Poured a dark gold with little head retention with little lacing.		S: The Saaz hops really come to the fore in this beer. The malt is quite subdued. 		M: Medium bodied with light carbonation. 		T: Crisp, with a nice bite on the finish. Malt remains in the background with this beer, no surprise there. 		D: Very drinkable and a nice alternate to judge other pilseners by. When I first began my beer quest, I hated this. I found it downright foul. Funny how tastes change...";;;;;;;;;;
"I tried this side-by-side with KBS. It is an excellent pour, but alas, I'd have to say, I much prefer the KBS.		The maple syrup character makes this just a little too sweet. KBS is already fairly sweet, but this just kicks it up a bit too much. I also prefer the aroma of KBS, but then again, that's because I love bourbon. So if you are not a fan of overly boozy bourbon barrel-aged beers, you are probably going to love this.		All of the other complexities remain. This is a very good beer that I was happy to be able to try, but falls short of being ""exceptional"" in my opinion.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Mainly drank this one out of the bottle, but a brief look revealed an amber/brown-ish colored beer with an off-white/tan head, like a Marzen, but a bit thicker.		S - Smell is of caramel and molasses, and lots of smoky character! It's almost like a smoked sausage or beef jerky character. As odd as that may sound, it's actually quite pleasant and unoffensive coming from a beer.		T - Taste if of rich, smooth caramel malts w/molasses notes, lots of ""woody"" character, and an almost meat-like flavor (I think of sausage/brats as I drink it). A very different flavor from what I'm used to, and yet, a quite delicious one! Somehow, the smoke/meat-ish elements blend amazingly well into beer. This is truly for the open-minded beer connoisseurs though.		M - Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and moderately carbonated, yet very smooth and pretty easy to drink.		D - Although it's a bit on the hearty side, I could happily enjoy a couple pints of it.		Overall - This was actually my first time trying a Rauchbier, and I honestly have to say this is a new style I've fallen in love with. However, it's very unique, and will probably come as an acquired taste for many. Nonetheless, something tells me I'll be coming back to this one regularly during the Winter, and enjoying some sausage or bratwursts with it!";;;;;;;;;;
"First off i want to thank my good buddy Sudsdog for just sending me this beer because i need to try it. Man, i love being a BA.	PS. Send more !		Poured the 12oz. stubby brown bottle into a Mad Elf tulip glass (Good Choice) Looked like dirty motor oil you know Texas crude,black oil I felt like a millionare. Opaque could also be used here. Got A 2'' mocha head from a hard pour had decent retention left a thick creamy layer that just would not die.Some beautiful lace curtians decorating the glass on the way down. Just a smigen shy of a 5 on the head		The aroma one word ""Heavenly"" complex to say the least. A strong charred wood smell,bakers chocolate the chocolate aroma reminded me of the ride through the Hershey factory.Very roasty,cappachino,sweet sents of chocolate throughtout. Very earthy,woody a toasty/toffee with a candied carmell and a hint of some vanallia creamer added.		Intense roastyness/bitter chocolate with strong charred/burnt wood tastes. Has a flash of alcohol in the mid taste with a note of vanallia. Great balance with a sharp,crisp,dry/puckering feel get right to the point. Very earthy feel with overtones of burbon throughout. The taste is simply out of this world.		The mouthfeel is extremely light and creamy, ""nitro-like"" with some some slight cloying this beer just seems to melt away in your mouth.	The most drinkable 10% stout you will find went down so smooth and easy really wishing I had more. Don't know what else to say other than: ""wish i had more"" A must try beer in my book !";;;;;;;;;;
"Hoppin' Frog Mean Manalishi Double IPA is rich, earthy, roasty, and gorgeous.		It poured a perfect deep copper with a two-finger tan head, and it let perfect thick, tight rings of lace. This was exactly the appearance I expect from a Double IPA. During, and right after the pour, there was a hint of citric aroma: however that quickly gave way to aroma matching the flavor: very rich earthyness, with pine resin and roasted malt. The after-taste was the most enjoyable and richest I ever experienced, dominated by salty dry roasted almonds. The feel was a little thin; however, it finished with a nice dryness that complimented the roasty/salty flavor.		When judging beer, I often ask, if I would acquire more of the beer I was drinking, or if I would work it into my regular rotation. Hoppin' Frog Mean Manalishi gets a resounding ""yes"" to both questions. The rich flavors and roasty finish make it a contender for another question I always ask: If I can only have one beer the rest of my life, what would it be?";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Pours an orange-gold color, with about a finger length head, soapy lacing that slowly slides down the edges		Smell: Citrus, some fruits, sweet maltiness, with hops in the background 		Taste: A hoppy flavor that has a nearly perfect complement of maltiness; roasted and caramel notes. Its very balanced, the hops are not overpowering; basically...really good. 		Mouthfeel: smooth and slick on the tongue, lightly carbonated, slightly syrupy, aftertaste occasionally contains the high alcohol content that you don't normally notice. 		Drinkability: High, very high. This is a tasty beer. It has a nice balance of sweet and bitterness. The alcohol content is pretty high and you don't really notice it till it enters the aftertaste which happens occasionally.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pour - dark as night and inky, very atramentous. Rather light in carbonation which seems pretty par for the course when it comes to strong barrel-aged ales. Once things settle in the glass its merely a black liquid with a super thin ring of off-white foam encircling the glass.	 	Aroma - the first thing that hits my nose is the dark roasted malt and coffee ground aromas. Once those fade I catch some faint hints of vanilla and cream. Smells very much like a shot of espresso with a sugar cube in it. 	 	Taste - one sip and the smoothness of barrel aging is apparent. This is like sipping half and half as far as the texture goes. Lots of dark roasted flavors are there along with some sweet vanilla and some tangy bourbon-esque flavors. Very easy on the lips and tongue and quite delicious. 	 	Overall - not an overly strong bourbon flavor but to me thats okay. Its there but very light however the softness of this beer really shines and we can thank the wood for that. Some vanilla and tannin flavors but the roasty, dark coffee flavors seem to take center stage. I really enjoyed this for what it was with no premonitions whatsoever. 	 	Would I buy more of it? - I probably would. If I am every traveling through Kentucky I'll definitely look for it. Thanks goes out to BEERchitecht for hooking me up!";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: poured a rich, cloudy , darker orange with a creamy offwhite head of half an inch.		Smell: Mmm fruity and citrusy hops abound. Lots of different sweet fruit like pear , mango etc mix with sweet malt , lots of citrusy hops and a bit of pine.		Taste: Lots of hop flavor and a huge maltiness. Hops are citrus , a bit oily and resinous , pine , pear , pinneapple, and slightly earthy. As strong as the hops are , the malt sweeps in with massive presence. Sweet bread and caramel steal the hops thunder in this tasting. Awsome balance and lingering aftertaste.		Mouthfeel: very viscous and smooth.		Drinkability: I am very surprised by this brew. It really shows how varied the DIPA style is. The malt is very impressive , and the fruity complexity is awsome. It also has that DIPA hop kick , this one just balances out the hops alot more. Could pass as a hoppy barleywine in my book.";;;;;;;;;;
12oz bottle in my Bell's tulip. Appearance is very nice, light strawberry red with small white head. Not much aroma. Taste is tart cherries with a dry finish. If it had any earthiness, it would be like your run of the mill kriek. Mouthfeel is very light, maybe almost too thin.;;;;;;;;;;
12 oz poured into tulip;;A: Light golden hue mixed with burnt orange. Hazy. Huge head when first poured which settles down rather quickly.;;S: Citrus and pine combine with pineapple and mango. Smells amazing. Not overly powerful.;;T: HOPS FORWARD! Dang this is a powerful hop bomb! Tastes just like it smells - pine and citrus. Nice balance to it as well with the sweet malt coming on gently after the initial hop bitterness.;;M: Medium bodied and the hops just linger on the tongue.;;D: There's a hint of alcohol. I like this beer and wish it was available locally!
"The beer poured into the glass clear deep brownish amber with a tan and long lasting head which laced the glass.		The aroma was smoky with a strong smoked meat inspiration. The smoke was prevalent and led the charge with a summer sausage aromatic. Behind that was some malt complexity but it was difficult to dicern and more difficult to describe.		The flavor was malty with a light tinny and metallic flavor. The hops were present and were a bit grassy and lightly spicy. The flavor was once again smoke, but not at an overdone level. The malt could shine through and the flavor was definitely that of a bock with some dark fruits pulling their weight.		The finish was dry with a lasting hop impression and smoke long into the aftertaste. The body was medium and the carbonation level was moderate with an awesome creamy texture. A great beer!		16.9 ounce bottle. Bottle says 6.5% ABV.";;;;;;;;;;
I thought I wouldn't have a beer this week that would rate above a B, but this one is really good. I might be a bit partial, seeing this beer comes from my hometown, (I did not know it until I tasted it and got curious about where it was brewed), but that withstanding, this is a good, unique beer. This is about to be my favorite style. This brew gave me about a one finger head of light brown suds and finally faded after about two minutes, the color is a rich dark amber-red rating a 26 on the SRM chart. The smell of apple, grapefruit, currant, rye, caramel, sweet malt, and raspberry are the strongest smells, with a hint of clover. This is a wonderful flavor far from your run of the mill brew. This beer has the flavor of grapefruit, berries, apple, malt, and finishes with a great bitter flavor of hops. The more I drink of this the better I like it. I am so glad I have access to this in the south. Feels like cream in my mouth, nice tingle and buzz as it passes over my tongue and down my throat. I only bought one bottle of this, but it sure won't be my last, and next time it will be in bigger quantities. For sure I will share this with my friends, I am sure some will not like it as much as I, but that is why we are all individuals.;;;;;;;;;;
Poured into a pint glass. Very dark amber almost brown. Nice cream white caremel head with some good sized bubbles and decent lace.;;Smells Hoppy like an IPA with a hint of some extra hidden goodness.;;And in the taste it is revealed. Rye. Very nice blend inside this liquid. Kudos to the brewer on this one. The warmer it gets the danker it is.;;Such a good beer. Don't know why isn't more popular.;;;;
"Thanks to weibull for this 12 oz bottle.		A: The brown ale is a dark hue, looking black throughout my glass except for at the base of the tumbler. There, a caramel brown color emerges. A small head on successive pours yielded no lacing.		S: Sweet caramel and toffee drive the malty side of the ale. From the hops side, nothing to report other than a balancing presence.		T: Man, this one surprised me (much like Negro Modelo, must be these darker Mexican cervezas). A bold caramel and toffee flavor greeted me upfront, sweet and lingering. As the malts fade, mild hops fill the void, balancing out the syrupy flavors. As a result, this isn't cloying. And I am very impressed.		M: The mouthfeel is dominated by the malts, but the toffee and caramel are a great one-two punch. Lingering chocolate, mild as it is, only serves to up the good taste.		D: More, please. I was expecting a ho-hum ale but the full malty flavor keeps me coming back. A real surprise from Cucap.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearence: Dark, with red highlights. Big, rocky head. Aroma: Malt caramel, also substantial spices. Flavor: Interesting balance; fairly dark malt beer which is balanced by substantial spiciness. Finish: Finish very dried out by spiciness, adding to the drinkability.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks goes out to a few great traders who have sent me this one 	The bottle poured into a tulip glass produced a large two fingers worth of tan head on top of a thick jet black body 		Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, and oats with a nice background of caramel and vanilla this has one of the best smells of any stout I have tried 		These tastes like you are eating a big dark chocolate bar while drinking a great cup of espresso with just enough caramel sweetness	To keep things from being overly bitter 		It poured like molasses nice and thick in the mouth as well with just enough carbonation to keep things interesting 		One a night would be my max on this one, but I wouldn't mind drinking this a few nights in a row. A great all around stout";;;;;;;;;;
"33 cl brown bottle with a best before date on the back label.		Appearance: Blunt brown hue, slightly hazy with a decent formed lace on top.		Smell: Whiff of coffee, star anise, bitter orange and carob. Smells a little like a chocolate orange candy.		Taste: Star anise is a bit strong and when it mixes with the crisp carbonation it helps to intensify the bite, roasted malt flavour is light but adds substantial depth and a carob / coffee flavour. Wood like flavours pucker the mouth a bit, very mild tartness as well. Evident orange peel and a modest hop bitterness help balance out some the malt sweetness. Alcohol grows in a cradling warmth and adds a layer of dark ripe fruit to the palate.		Mouthfeel: Lush smoothness with a long creaminess on sturdy medium body.		Drinkability & Notes: Very bold with a full array of complexities, the spiciness cleanses the palate to get it ready for an other sip. Paired well with some three pepper braised beef tenderloins.		Thanks to D & V International for the sample. http://www.specialtybeer.com";;;;;;;;;;
"My stupidity put me on a bus going the wrong way not too long ago. Fortunately for me, I realized there was a Binny's I had never been to. This Binny's, the one on Grand, was not the biggest but they did have the seasonal I've been waiting for for a while now. It lasted less than two weeks in my fridge before I grabbed it and decided to pour it into my brandy snifter.		Vision	Standard characteristics of a pumpkin ale here. Crisp white bubbles that lasted only a few seconds before leaving the barest resemblance of a collar. Burnt-orange to rust colored body reveal a few columns of never-ending carbonation. 		Bouquet	This beer turned me into a time traveler. I swear I was sitting at Thanksgiving 2009 with my eyes close, inhaling deeply the pumpkin pie in front of me. It is identical to every pie that has ever been baked in my presence. That strong pumpkin aroma laced with ginger and cinnamon help stir positive emotions like few beers can. And who can forget the nutmeg. They stand alone as well as together upon every sniff.		The cloves are strong players as well, but they bring up the caboose of this pleasure train. I'm very impressed with this beer. It met my expectations and exceeded them with ease. It is not just spices, it is not just pumpkin. It is the harmonizing of the pumpkin lead singer and spice back-up choir. 		Taste	The flavors from this beer are outrageous. Subtle while not losing their unique characteristics. The first train car to pass over my lingual muscle is a dessert car. I feel like they took the spirit of pumpkin pie and nailed it. It is that wonderful flavor combination that can not be mistaken for anything else. 		Dissecting it further, it is initially pumpkin and cinnamon twirling in an intricate dance with no fumbles to note. Nutmeg peeks its little head out of the second car as the memory of cinnamon and pumpkin fade to the background. 		The last car to pass the station is got to be the cloves. This bitter caress that is seemingly unique. There are sweet notes with it, but it is principally a bitter flavor.		Oral Sensations	I wasn't expecting the body that flowed through my mouth tonight. I want to call it full in texture, but its not quite there yet. It is deceivingly close to being full in nature. It feels smooth, comforting. It is like my favorite pair of pajamas after a long day of dress clothes. 		It lingers on my palate, on the roof of my mouth, on my lips, on everything! It is welcome because of the gentle sweetness that constantly perks up. 		Conclusions	I'm amazed. Truly amazed. The alcohol only comes out in the slight heat I feel at the back of my neck. It is easy to down, and if I am not careful I find myself sipping this quicker than most beers due to its deliciousness.		Hoppin' Frog finally hit a home run in my book, and I am definitely going to pick this one up to share with others. To sum it up, smells great, tastes great, looks okay, and drinks well.";;;;;;;;;;
"I reviewed this beer the other night while listening to Luigi Dallapiccola's ""Canti di prigionia"" which is this ridiculously difficult atonal choral piece from about 1940. Atonal music has been warming up to me more recently, and coincidentally so has rye beer. This is definitely the beer to try if one is warming up to the style. I poured this one into my Michelob Amber Bock glass.	No freshness date.		A: Beautiful beer! The body is a cloudy orange-red sunset in the desert...I am getting carried away. The orange tinted tan head head is full and sticky, leaving some respectable lacing before dying to a thin layer.		S: Also, a beautiful smell! I am getting whiffs of cotton candy, melon, berry and citrus hops. The smell is just saturating. It is soaked with pungent hop aromas. It also smells incredibly sweet, as one could tell by the cotton candy aroma coming out of the glass.		T: The sweet smell that I was getting out of the beer is surprisingly absent in the taste. In its place is an assertive spice that is attributable to the rye bill (and maybe a bit by the hops). The hops definitely do their job in bumping up the IBUs. Very bitter aftertaste, strongly hopped. The alcohol also kicks the flavor a few times.		M: Light-medium body with minimal carbonation, however not flat. The mouth is left with a slight hop bruise after the first few sips, but they do not dry out the tongue as I have sometimes experienced with ""big hop"" beers.		D: It is exciting to drink. Wonderful introduction to rye beers for me. Founder's treats it more like an IPA, but with this rye character, there is something different than other IPAs.";;;;;;;;;;
"It's getting a little colder out and I wanted a big beer for my 200th review, so when I stumbled upon old B.O.R.I.S. here I knew he was the one. 		B.O.R.I.S., which apparently stands for Bodacious Oatmeal Russian Imperial Stout (badass name for an Impy Stout), pours a deep, opaque black color similar to the darkest chocolate in liquid form (though maybe not the same consistency). The beer puts up about a finger of milk-chocolate colored head that lasts for a minute or two before dissipating, leaving some nice drapes of lacing on the side of the glass. 		The aroma is pretty good. Some earthy hops, molasses, dark chocolate, some roasted malts, and maybe a bit of maple oatmeal all float around in a fragrant soup of smell. Complex and ever-changing, especially as it warms, this is one inviting beer. 		Similar to the nose, the flavor is deep and complex. Some dark roasted malts up front, drizzled with dark chocolate. Oatmeal, molasses, and dark licorice through the middle. A little bit of herbal/earthy hop flavor, alcohol spice, and more bittersweet chocolate on the finish. Complicated and ever-changing... even though BORIS has a manly name, he's a bit like a woman. All joking aside, this is a good RIS.		The mouthfeel is pretty good. It's nice and smooth, with an oily feel in the mouth. Maybe it could be a bit creamier, but that's nitpicking. Either way, though, it still boasts a body that's a notch or two above medium and has a well-regulated amount of carbonation, as well as a slight bit of alcohol on the finish. Not bad at all.		Overall, this is a good example of a Russian Imperial Stout, and my bomber is going pretty quickly. Complex, flavorful, and a good-lookin' beer too. B.O.R.I.S. was a good choice for a 200th review.";;;;;;;;;;
I wouldnt say that Ive become obsessed with smoked beers, but I have recently become utterly fascinated with them. Ive had the Schlenkerla Marzen dozens of times, but this was my first taste of the Urbock. The aroma is welcomingly smoky. Fresh and intense (my wife said that she could smell it from several feet away when I opened the bottle). Wonderful. The intensity, however, isnt great enough to overwhelm a rich malty aroma thats hidden underneath. The color is a deep amber-brown with a sticky tan head. Similar to the aroma, theres smoke at the center of the taste (its got a peppery tingle on the tongue), but it doesnt completely eclipse the malt. Good sweetness and a notable malt flavor. Bitterness is in the finish, but you cant really taste the hops through the smoke. I love these beers.;;;;;;;;;;
"Sampled: 12 oz bottle, cellar temp, into pint glass.		Pours dark brown, almost opaque, with a decent head the color of the inside of a malted milk ball. The aroma is smoky, roasty maltiness.		Fairly well carbonated, with a fizz on the tongue. Starts out with a dryish malty flavor, blossoming at the end into roasted malt and unsweetened chocolate flavors - a hint of black dark roast coffee?  Not much in the way of hops, save for a nice underlying bitterness.  Worth trying for the way the flavors explode at the end alone. A very enjoyable, well made stout - good in the bottle, and exceptional on tap.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.		Appearance: Pours a dark amber hue with two fingers of fluffy foam that settles after a while. 		Smell: Malty sweetness that comes across with raisin, cinnamon, toffee. Great aroma. 		Taste: Sweet bready malt, raisin, toffee, slight vanilla as it warms. Very good. 		Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a slight stingy-alcohol burn at the end. 		Drinkability: While I can't see this being an everyday beer, I definitely will enjoy this again. I have 3 bottles left from my 4 pack that I want to age a little bit.";;;;;;;;;;
I did not perceive much in the way of oatmeal character in the malt, but this beer nicely fits the Russian Imperial Stout category. Dense, inky black pour. A bit of sweet roasted malt in the nose. Mouthfeel is dense, a bit syrupy, but thins toward the finish. Deep roasted malt, with no burnt character. Some bourbon notes, even though this is not a barrel-aged version. A bit of black pepper at the finish. Surprisingly drinkable.;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours into my New Holland pint glass hazy brown/red with no head at all. Swirling around in the glass gives a tiny bit of soapscum, but nothing significant. Some chill haze in the glass. Considering the ABV, this is pretty much as-expected. 		Smells strongly of wheat malt, crisp and clean, with a slight grainy quality. Significant alcohol astringency, hints of hops buried deep. 		Taste is amazing, rich deep notes of malted wheat with hints of spicy undertones. The alcohol really starts to burn as the beer warms. 		Mouthfeel is thick, with a significant carbonation that stings the tongue. 		Drinkability fairly high, nice and smooth (even if it could use a bit of aging) but is this really worth the effort to obtain. New Holland's Pilgrim's Dole is just about as good and much more readily available.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: It poured a cloudy, ruby tinted orange body with a sticky off white head. The head was just over one finger and lingered before settling to an even cover over the liquid. There was initial dense lacing that fell down the side of the glass leaving clumps sticking to the side of the glass. 		S: A bold citrus hop profile hits the nose even before the beer is poured. Beneath the hops were nice aromas of toasted malts flavored with caramel. 		T: It was a complex blend of hops and malts. The hops dominate giving off flavors of tart grapefruit and sweet pineapples. The malts were sweet and creamy. It was like drinking a caramel covered pink grapefruit (if that were possible, I'd try it!). There was little bitter bite to this IPA giving it a nice sweet-tart flavor.		M: It was a medium bodied beer with a creamy feel on the tongue and modest carbonation. It finished tart and clean. 		D: I enjoyed the great balance struck between the malts and hops. Given the moderate ABV and great flavors this is a nice beer to take long into the night.";;;;;;;;;;
"Another day up in Asheville, and it was HOT! The only thing to keep you cool was several trips around	to the local watering holes. Consumed on tap on 07/06/2010.		Finally I get to drink the brown bear. Sat down in the mushroom and ordered this one up. Nice dark	brown pour with some light garnet shining in on the sides and bottom and nice off white head capping	the top,		Aroma is caramel, coffee, touches of light chocolate and loads of roasted malts. Warming allows some	earthy hops to take hold but not too much. Just enough to keep it interesting. Rich, creamy feel hits	you just the right way as it was not too filling but had enough of a bite to keep me interested. Nice	smooth, fading finish was just about right as the final touches of flavor lapsed off the tongue.		Overall this was very solid and something I would love to try again any day.";;;;;;;;;;
"This was the perfect beer to sit down with on this hot, muggy evening after working a stressful 12 hour shift. I owe my thanks to LSUPT for this one. Once again, supplying me with some great brews. Cheers Alex!		Pours a very nice looking pale yellow, that is quite see through. Carbonation races to the top to meet the remains of the 1"" white head sits. Minor lacing on the edges of my Half Acre pint glass. 		Smells of toasted bread, malts, spices, subtle citrus, vanilla, and honey. 		Taste is a very nice mash of everything I smelt. I like how the spices flow into the semi sweet vanilla/honey finish. Slight German hops are noticeable along with some grass. Delicious.		The mouthfeel is outstanding. Perfect for the style. Medium bodied with a slight creamy finish. For some reason its making me crave something salty. I might indulge in some baked Jalapeno chips for the remainder of this treat.		Very glad I got to try this. Perfect for the summer days, but I could definitely see myself grabbing one of these at any time of the year. A beer that could easily be a staple in my fridge (if it were available in my area).";;;;;;;;;;
"Luna de Miel - Harmonious Honeymoon Ale - is quite a treat.  Ingredients feature wildflower honey and raspberry puree.  Both special ingredients make their presence known in this ale.		The beer doesn't look like anything special.  It's a slightly hazy, deep reddish colored brew with very little head, but plenty of apparent carbonation in the body (though certainly not fizzy).  Smell is rich, full of sweet florals and some tart raspberry.  The flavor is tart, with the raspberry flavor dominating.  However, the honey balances the tartness well, while adding an impressive twist to the flavor.  The tartness hits full-force initially, and the sweet honey comes in in the middle for balance, and closes with a dry sweet finish.  A smooth brew, with carbonation and alcohol producing a slightly warm and rough feel in the mouth.  A very refreshing and drinkable brew - not too tart, not at all syrupy.  A very good ale when you want a change from your norm.";;;;;;;;;;
That's right, this serving was from the bottle. I just got my hands on a limmited 22 oz bottle. This red passion poured with a fizzy head that was gone in an instant. The smell was like sweet frozen raspberry lemonade concentrate you get at the grocerie store. Very tart, no alcohol phenols smell present. Mouthfeel is crisp, fizzy but thick. Taste is great. Big raspberry up front with a little dry almond after taste. Drinkability is outstanding, you could easily go through a 22oz'er yourself. I think I just might do that.;;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Pours an opaque, dark brown body with a thinnish, beige head.		Smell: Brown malt aroma with a nice amount of chocolate to it.		Taste: Brown malt flavor that, while light, does display nutty, earthy tones and a mild sweetness. Hints of chocolate. Finishes dry and with a soft bitterness and still more of the chocolate. 		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.		Drinkability: Very drinkable and quite flavorful for a light-ABV brown ale.";;;;;;;;;;
"Got from Total Wine in Cary, poured into a pint glass.		I'm not very discriminate on a beer's appearance, so it looked like any other IPA to me. Same with smell, nothing unexpected for this style.		This beer definitely goes under the ""good"" category of IPAs. It does not turn me away from the style and it is enjoyable to drink. However, it is not one of those rare and special ones that I have had that really sticks out to me. Has a good hop taste, but not much of that grapefruit or citrus flavor that really goes well with that bitter hoppiness. 		Overall, is definitely a good one to try. You never know, it may turn out to be your favorite. However, in my opinion, it is not one that I would choose over any other decent IPA that I have had before.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz can poured into a pint		An amber colored body with some orange highlights. A firm two finger cap with very good retention and sticky lace all over the glass.		The aroma is bright. Ruby red grapefruit, pine resin and floral hops on top of a sweet caramel malt bed. Slightly more hop forward than malt forward on the nose.		A little bit more of a balance here. It's like east coast meets west coast in one can. Big grapefruit and pine with sturdy caramel holding down the back end.		Sticky and resiny on the feel, medium body with good carbonation.		This guy has some nice attributes. Some bold hop flavors and aromas, but they strike a good balance with the malt.";;;;;;;;;;
"Served on tap at Local Option in an 8 oz. stange. From notes.		Appearance: This pours molasses, nearly black. A small ring is the only head present due to a continuous pour form the tap. The small head actually retains fairly nicely. Spots of lace.		Smell: Molasses, caramel, figs, burnt caramel malt. 		Taste: There is definitely a strong sweetness up front, with burnt sugar and molasses really driving the flavor. Roast and caramel malt add some further flavor, and then a nice blend of figs and other dark fruits provide even more depth. Some booziness sneaks in here and there.		Mouthfeel: Slightly sticky with a very full body. Light to medium carbonation. Smooth, a little harsh and boozy at points.		Overall: Very smooth and drinkable.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a shaker: Amber with gold highlights under two fingers sticky, meringue with tapioca bubbles. Lots of small, slow nucleation, patches of sticky lacing.		Piney orange marmalade in the smell, with a cakey, ""browned edges"" kind of sweetnes, like an orange cake with a zesty hop brightness. Good stuff.		Bitterness hits immediately in the flavor, with zest & pine, then lets in a bit of orange & caramel sugar, then a mild lemon tea-like dryness in the finish. Nice bracing bitterness in the finish, too, rounding off like an orange muffin.		Medium-full-bodied, mildly abrasive bitterness, smooth finish & then a woody/tannic feel.		Straight up good, nothing showy or crazy, hits the right notes & definitely assertive. Well done.";;;;;;;;;;
"Aroma: Spices, pepper, bitter chocolate followed by vanilla and cinnamon as the beer warmed.		Appearance: Thick black body with a tan-brown head.		Flavor: Roasted caramel, chocolate, and hints of bitterness. The alcohol is well masked.		Mouthfeel: Heavy full-bodied beer with a short creamy and every so slightly dry finish.		Overall: Very subtle for a huge barrel aged stout. Lots of interesting spice and roasted malt notes. Easily drinkable.";;;;;;;;;;
"I really like Black Sheep beers, all the ones Ive tried have great hop flavor and are also impeccably balanced. This Brown Ale is true to form. It also has a wimsical label that I like a lot. 		It pours a deep mahogany with a frothy cappucino head that lasts forever. Lacing is copious and chunky. The aroma is equal parts grassy, floral hops and chocolatey, roasty malts. The taste is complex with loads of Chocolate malts, husky grainyness and a subtle tea like astringency. Im sure this is a hop characteristic. 		The hops are prevelant throughout. They are cedary, pithy and floral, with only a slight bitterness in the finish. This is not as hoppy as Sam Smith's Nut Brown, but the amount of hops provides a satisfactory compliment to the wall of malt flavors. Theres a dry slightly fruity yeasty flavor and some peaty notes in the background. 		The mouthfeel is lighter than expected with toned down carbonation. The Black Sheep Brewery has down in again with this brew. Its an excellent Brown Ale that is dangerously quaffable.";;;;;;;;;;
"500 mL brown bottle.		Pours a clear, dark brown with a nice off-white head of fine bubbles.		Huge smoky bacon aroma.		Smoke is the dominant flavour here. Smoked meat, campfire and charcoal come to mind. Some roasted malt notes come through and the hops pick up towards the middle and lend some bitterness. Medium body with moderate carbonation.		Pleasant and unusual.";;;;;;;;;;
(Served in a snifter);maybe a red cap?;;A- This beer pours a jet black inky body with a thick cocoa head that fades to a thick ring and sticks to the glass a bit after each sip. ;;S- The chocolate rich nougat malt character is full and out shadows other aromas. ;;T- The full smooth dark malt has some soft barrel finish with notes of caramel and graham sweetness coming through as the beer opens up. There is a spicy heat in the finish that supports and cuts the thick malt a bit. Some vanilla notes with the bourbon in the finish takes on an inky note in the finish. ;;M- The full mouthfeel has an alcohol warmth in the finish. ;
The first bottle I drank was very heavy on the coffee smell and flavor. The second bottle seemed more oatmeal and chocolate. Anyway, the beer looked the same both times: black with a nice brown head. The mouth-feel was very smooth and the drinkability was pretty good. I liked this one a lot more the second time I drank it. I did enjoy this one more than the Terrapin Wake-N-Bake which is a very good beer itself.;;;;;;;;;;
Pours a mostly opaque dark brown with a small tan head. Brewed about 2 months ago. Smell is rather smoky malts with a hint of sweetness, nothing too unusual. Taste is a nice hearty dash of smoke and peat and bitterness, with a good paintbrush-like swath of semi-sweet malts. Nicely complex. Went well with bratwurst.;;;;;;;;;;
"This brew poured a clear gold color with visible lively carbonation and a white one inch head that receeded rather quickly. No lacing on the glass.		Aroma was of sweet bubblegum and grapefruit.		Sweet and smooth malty flavor with a light hop bitterness at the end. Pretty standard English Pale Ale flavor.		Medium bodied, flavor doesn't linger too much, but easy on the taste buds.		Easy to drink. If the flavors were a bit more pronounced, I think this would be a much better beer. Overall good, a decent session beer.";;;;;;;;;;
Nice dark and rich bock. Deep reddy-brown, light tan head. Malt, toffee, liquorice allsorts and light wine in the nose. Grape, malt, toffee, milk chocolate, allsorts, fruit all come through in the taste. Low carbonation, slightly oily. Could be a bit more carbonated. Light alcohol and candies in the aftertaste. A nice, creamy, tasty bock.;;;;;;;;;;
"The bottle has a great label, detailing the word ""riggwelter,"" which is really rather comical. This Yorkshire ale looks heaven-sent sitting in the glass: thick, almost unmoveable cream-with-brown patches head; creamy, puffy, and everything a head should be on a good strong ale. As solid and smooth looking as thick caramel icing on a cake. Deep hues of coppery red, amber/maple syrup, rust, with the solid look of a glittering precious stone. I cannot imagine many other beers that fit the word ""ale"" in appearance so exceptionally. The aroma at first smote me with spicy nuttiness, creamy coffee, bitter baker's chocolate, raisins and dates and even cinammon. Behind the frontal aroma there is a noticeable aged leather smell, or meat, with chemical-like pungency. Also some saltiness, and a sweeter pepper, perhaps cayenne. The aroma is similar to some good British stouts, but not as a strongly burnt or chocolate/coffee-filled, which pleases me personally. This manages to combine a hearty, robust and spicy stout aroma with the milder, more fruity sweet brown ales. Throughout two or more glasses of Riggwelter, you will never bore of the aroma, that is certain. The taste is nicely grainy at first, with some caramel and/or crystal malt giving some sweetness, but quickly the darker malt and strong hop bitterness assert themselves, leaving a pleasantly dry palate. Very well balanced, with the malt only subtlely more powerful. Syrup, oats, molasses, some alcohol, raisins, rich coffee--but all these less bold than in a stout, and it constitutes this beer far more drinkable. Leather tastes, salt, and a hop character felt more by its dryness than its taste. Smoked and meaty sometimes. Mouthfeel is full, though not so heavy, with low carbonation, leaving little gaseous feel. Though strong and filling, it passes through the mouth quite easily: nicely drinkable on a colder autumn or winter night.";;;;;;;;;;
"The pinnacle of fruit beers. 		Pours like light grape juice with a beautiful pink head. 		The smell. Raspberry, raspberry, and more raspberry. The smell is heavenly.		The taste - even better. Pure raspberry, but nothing artificial. It's nearly impossible to discern anything else but raspberry. Divine!		Overall: This beer will change your view on fruit beers forever. No hint of the alcohol, just raspberry. This bomber though is meant to be shared. A whole bottle would be too much.";;;;;;;;;;
"Small capped beer poured into a snifter. Aged one year in my cellar but unsure about bottling date. 		Nearly pitch black, average sized dark brown head, reasonable retention and lacing.	The aroma, just like the beer itself makes for a very good stout, richer than average, but not quite a double or imperial - northyorksammy called it 1.5X which seems about right.	Dark malt, lots of chocolate, milk, with just a touch of bourbon and vanilla. 	Medium bodied, very smooth, highly drinkable, mostly showing chocolate, but also hints of roasted malts, milk, bourbon, vanilla. 	This could be called an exceptional stout, or a good double stout. Depends what you are looking for this evening.";;;;;;;;;;
"Served on tap at Stoudt's Brewery in Adamstown, PA.		Transparent gold body with a huge foamy head. Tons of visible carbonation. Great lace.		Aroma is muted and not really impressive. Some sharp hops and a slight sweetness.		Flavor of crisp biter hops mixed with biscuity malt. Crisp, clean, and bitter. I could drink many of these.";;;;;;;;;;
A - Pours a hazy golden color with a one finger width white head. Some thin lacing sticks around on the glass. ;;S- Some slight bitter hop aromas with grapefruit and piney notes. I'm getting a more mild IPA aroma off this one. Some delicate flower like aromas. ;;T- Taste pretty much follows the aroma with a faint bitterness from the hops. Drinks like a more mild Founders IPA. This one is a very nice easy drinking beer. ;;M- Very light body with a nice refreshing crispness and clean finish. Very nice beer. ;;O- Very drinkable and great tasting. Founders has not let me down yet with any of there approaches. Cheers Founders !;;
"Bottle courtesy of mikesgroove and opened up at Pliny the Younger release day (2/5/10).		A: The pour is a thick and black with no head to speak of.		S: A great nose on this beer. A fair amount of whiskey, but nice notes of vanilla, graham cracker, chocolate, roasted malt and molasses. All things I enjoy smelling in a -bal aged stout.		T: While the nose was quite good, the flavor is only ""good"". Milk chocolate and whiskey are the first two flavors I pick up, followed by some vanilla and char.		M: I really enjoyed the creamy, viscous texture this beer has on the tongue. While there's not much in carbonation, the beer avoids being too syrupy.		D: Certainly not a beer to sit down and drink a bomber of, but always an enjoyable experience, but perhaps a touch too sweet.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours to a slightly hazy light copper color with a creamy white head. Leave a good amount of lacing when sipped down. The aroma is fruity, with pears and apples and a bit of earthiness. Very pleasant aroma. The flavor is light in malty and fruity, again with a apple, pear taste. It kinda a has a woody, earthy taste to it as well. A nice brew, not what I was expecting.;;;;;;;;;;
"This beer was supposedly inspired by recipe from a home brewer named Gene the bartender told me about.		Appearance: clear brown in color with a 1"" head that lingers a while. Nice lacing paints the glass.		Smell: caramel and sweet malts are easy to detect and pull from the glass.		Taste: nice malty brown ale with some caramel, mild fruit sweetness, and a perfect balancing bitterness. 		Moutfeel: smooth from start to finish. Medium bodied. Aftertaste is short as the flavors leave the tongue in seconds after swallowing.		Drinkability: this is a great tasting brown ale that was my favorite beer at Moon River on my two trips. Must give this a try if it is on tap.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Pours a thick black with a dark tan head.		S: Strong smells of toasted malt and coffee. Faint smells of oats and chocolate. Complex to the nose, this has to be good.		T: Coffee hits strong then toasted malts reappear. More coffee flavor than I could detect from the smell...Tasty! Flavor of bitter chocolate mix in with the coffee.		M/D: Thick, rich, and smooth texture. Lots of fine carbonation. Coffee makes the finish a bit dry as you would expect. But very drinkable.		Had this after my first KBS, I see where the greatness begins. Solid beer, having this again for sure.";;;;;;;;;;
"Served in a Chicago Bears shaker pint glass.		Right on, a new Kiwi brewery in town, and one that pays homage to a classic musical troupe. Nice. This offering pours a kinda cloudy sunset straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises yellow grapefruit zest, light lemon zest, light sweet caramel (nicely in the background), and an overarching bit of what seems like toasted caramel corn. I gotta say, as slightly unorthodox as this comes across to my nose, it's more than pleasant. The taste holds notes of grapefruit rind, orange zest, lemon rind, light pine sap, perfume-y flowers, bitter grass, and a touch of mild (though still decently sweet) caramel in the background. The fairly strong bitterness near the finish keeps this from being truly pleasing, but doesn't completely knock things off the tracks. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a pretty solid IPA, something I haven't had too much of from the lands down under. I look forward to trying other things from these guys.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle poured into pint glass	A - pours a deep hazy amber/yellow, with a big two finger white head	S - bitter citrusy hops. and sweet malts, good balance	T - delicious. super sweet citrus, hoppy bitterness, and sweet malts all balanced 	M - smooth, creamy, easy to drink, delicious	O - not as good as hop wallop, but possible the second best double ipa from pa, i am biased since i like bitter better";;;;;;;;;;
"Served on tap in a pint glass. Deep, dark brown body, with a creamy two finger mocha head. Some light lacing on the glass. Looks good.		Light aroma. Mostly getting a little roasted malt and sweet molasses.		Chocolate. Cool. Wasn't really expecting that. Excellent blend of flavors including some toffee, coffee, malt, with just a hint of rye at the end.		Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. This beer is well done. One of the best offerings I've had from Yazoo.";;;;;;;;;;
"8 oz snifter at Founder's.		Pours a clear ruby red, some tan highlighting, thin white head forms, slowly settles to a thin collar that sticks, some big lacing all over the glass, looks good. Smell is neat, very sweet and caramelized, maple, vanilla, alcohol, some floral, buttery oak, biscuits, bourbon, brown sugar, quite sweet but nice. Taste is nice, very sugary, caramel and maple, vanilla butterscotch, oak, more maple, alcohol, very malty and sweet, touch of bourbon and raisin in the finish with coconut. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, some warmth going down but very smooth for the ABV. This is a nice beer if a little on the sweet side, could have used a bit more maple character but the oaking is great.";;;;;;;;;;
Good looking IPA with a very enjoyable aroma. There is a mix of mango puree, pine and citrus. Flavor is nicely balanced between bitter herbal hops and the acidity of citrus. Crisp and full mouthfeel with appropriate carbonation. Nice bitter, somewhat dry finish.;;;;;;;;;;
"Served in dining room of Crater Lake Lodge, Crater Lake National Park, OR, in 12 ounce pilsner glass.		Dark amber color with one finger head.		Initial hop aroma pronounced.		Slight lemon tang gave way to pronounced hop finish.		Very drinkable, would make a good session beer.		A pity I was not able to try CBC's IPA this trip. As good as the Amber was, the IPA would have been outstanding.";;;;;;;;;;
A solid IPA with nicely assertive citrus hops notes that mellow into a moderate bittering as the beer progresses. The higher abv is well integrated in the flavor profile and a bit deceptive - lulling you into thinking several of these in a session would be a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;
"Nice 1cm white head atop a deep orange/brown beer.		An aromatic perfume wafts up from the glass even whilst pouring the beer. Spicy but fresh, orange peel, lemon/ lemon basil/mint smell. 		Imagine something like an Orval but with added spicy fruitiness, but slightly less hoppy an you're about there.Fruity, hoppy and citric, Complex dry and spicy with an even drier aftertaste.		Far too drinkable for it's 9% ABV - drinks at about half that strength. Oh dear! Enjoy, but beware. ? Top class stuff!";;;;;;;;;;
"A: poured with a rich, white head about 1/4 inch thick, which fades to some lace around the rim. The color is slightly hazy (almost clear) bright golden yellow.		S: fresh hops of citrus and earthy notes. Incredibly aromatic!		T: sweet and bitter. There are tones of lemon, fresh parsley, and it ends with a slight nuttiness. 		M: nicely carbonated, medium body, and crisp";;;;;;;;;;
"Yeah, so a lot of reviews of Devil Dancer have complained of a taste/smell of onion/garlic. You can go ahead and file this under that subcategory. I was really struggling to get this one down, and not because of the 12% ABV. Although if you want to taste an onion beer, this is your chance. Tastes remarkably un-boozy for its ABV, even dangerously so - which I like. The head is low, but I don't really feel like it's too uncarbonated. I'm not getting all of the complex grapefruit/pine notes that others are getting, but whatev's. 		My suggestion: If possible, get just one bottle of this until you try it. Or share with friends. Won't buy again, but still fun to drink. Certainly not worth the price tag. I'm not going to bother buying another to age, but it will be interesting to see what happens.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle shared by Sammy, served in a Snifter. 		Poured an amber brown, lots of floaties in the body. Mild cream coloured head. Nose has loads of caramel, toffee, some orange and other citrus notes as well. Layers upon layers of caramel emerge in different strengths from this. Taste has even more caramel notes, significant malt base and an orange/grapefruit/citrus hoppy bite. Sticky feel, full mouthfeel and a bitter lingering finish. Medium low carbonation, and a pleasant but not outstanding barleywine. Solid.";;;;;;;;;;
"A nitro-tap pour at the new Brass Rail Deli. Served in one of the special Sam Adams glasses.		A: The stout is pitch black with a gorgeous off-white head. The head filled several fingers of the glass and retained a thick consistency throughout.		S: The nose is coffee, thick and acrid with a sweet chocolate undertone.		T: The nitro pour has added a distinct smoothness to the ale, softening the blow of the imperial stout. The result is chocolatey with an overroasted quality. The coffee, strong as it is, has also been toned down. The flavors are sharp, concentrated like a cup of Starbucks.		M: The creamy foam takes a great deal of the edge off of the ale, making it much more enjoyable even if some of the dominant coffee flavors have subsided.		D: Quite drinkable, I prefer the beer on a regular tap but it was interested to see what nitro did to it.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle poured into a Cigar City Snifter.	Bottled 11/05/10.		A-&gt; Pours a deep black with a think half finger of mocha-colored head that doesn't totally go away but doesn't stick around too much either. Thing clingy ring of bubbles around the outer edge with a tiny bit of lace.		S-&gt; Whoooosuh! Sinus clearing alcoholic dark chocolate and roasted grains with some toffee. Bouquet is rather complex and very bold.		T-&gt;Wanted to let this warm up and breathe a bit before I tried it but the first few sips are extremely dark, velvety chocolate with some bitter coffee and roasted malts/grains. Flavor really seems to linger on the tongue and throat with a slight blend of bitter burn that is by no means unpleasant. Really a lot going on here with the chocolate and malt sweetness, not too much of the flaked oats as they are likely overpowered by the coffee and bitter chocolate. Bit of warming alcohol and a slightly acidic (hop?) bite. Delicious balance of everything that is happening in here. Getting some oak-ish flavors and some molasses hints as well. Still discovering more and more as this gets warmer and warmer...		M-&gt; Full-bodied for sure. Like bitter chocolate velvet going down with a nice coffee aftertaste that hangs around pretty extensively. Creamy, velvety, smooth, sweet, bit of carbonation but the perfect subtle amount makes this a wonderfully balanced stout.		O-&gt; 2x chocolate + coffee + oatmeal = one amazing concoction. It's as if a new layer of flavor complexity is peeled back as this progressively breathes and gets warmer. A fascinating spectacle to experience. Curious to try this with more age on it as even after 5 + months it still is invigorating. Another job well done Founders...";;;;;;;;;;
This was a clearly well-balanced beer. Too often when we get hopped beers, it becomes a hop bomb, and I am of the persuasion that interesting beers are interesting, but quaffable beers are paragon. The familiar grassy, floral smell of hops is present in the nose, but the taste was not dominated completely by hops. They were there, of course, but played well with the malt too and neither bashed you over the head. That's what I appreciated about this beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"Picked thisone up at the brewery as I heard it was available bottled again. Its been awhile since i've seen it.		Pours very dark, motor oil thick, full bodied. The head is awesome. Milk chocolate color of thick. pillow-like foam that maintains well. Lace is brief but web like.		Aroma is dark bakers chocolate, coffee bean and a smokey char of alcohol.		Taste carries those same qualities but with a dark fruit hint of overall intense flavor.		The mouthfeel does it for this beer. Very smooth with enough carbonation to soften the strength of this beer making very pleaseing to drink. No strong bitter over the top dry bean aftertaste. Just good stout imperial goodness.";;;;;;;;;;
"I had a 500 ml bottle at tria the other day. The pour is amber/orange with a quickly receding white head. The aroma is full of sweet smoke, it reminds me of smoked bacon. The beer taste a little sweeter than it smells. Smoked meat is the dominant flavor, the smokiness lingers for a while in the finish. The beer was lighter in body than I expected, had a nice ""clingy"" mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this, I was surprised even the nonbeer drinkers liked it.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to Norsebrew for leaving the extra bottle at my place after our tasting. Bottled 2/25 and reviewed 10/23. Almost 8 months old but that didn't seem to hurt the brew that much.		Pours a deep amber with 1 finger of sticky head that reduces to a thin layer that persists. Aroma is strongly citrus. Lots of grapefruit with a sweet floral/tangerine undertone, almost like the sweet scent of flowers on a citrus tree (my parents use to have a lime tree and this beer smells like when that tree was in bloom). As I continue to let the beer open up I get a touch of alcohol on the nose but nothing overpowering. Taste is strong but not overpoweringly bitter. The hops are still there but aren't as present as on the nose. The citrus is balanced with a touch of malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is clean with active carbonation. Overall, this is a really nice IPA, I only noticed halfway through drinking it that it is almost 8 month old so I would be interested to try it fresh but it must have been well taken care of because the hop aroma and flavor was still very pronounced.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured a 500-ml can into a large glass beer stein.		Appearance - golden yellow beer with ample carbonation. Poured without too much head; almost no head or lacing after about a minute.		Smell - very mellow, malty scent. Fresh solidly wheat aromas.		Taste - here's a beer whose taste matches precisely the expectation of the smell. Very well balanced effort, with consistent flavour throughout - a little spice on the end.		Mouthfeel and Drinkability - a smooth, refreshing character, could be consumed endlessly indoors on a late winter or early spring evening.";;;;;;;;;;
The beer poured a nice golden color. There was a distinct hoppy aroma, which translated into a deep hoppy flavor and a great dry finish. The beer left the palate with that dry finish and a smooth opening taste. Subtle undertones of pepper were evident with the beer. A very nice pale ale.;;;;;;;;;;
"12oz bottle served in a snifter.		pours a dull, cloudy orange while yielding a thin, short-lived white head. 		nose is both fragrant and unique... notes of maple, bourbon, vanilla, a touch of fruit, hops, and some astringency in the background. 		more of the same delivered in the flavor. on the sweet side, but nowhere near cloying. still pretty hot and some hoppiness despite 2 years of aging. chewy, medium-full bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation.		overall, a very nice change of pace. interesting and complex, yet i have to say i think nemesis, even at 12% ABV, is a better beer fresh. sort of a moot point given the status of the beer, unfortunately.";;;;;;;;;;
Its great to see this old school northwertern company now here in the triad.Poured into a imperial nonic a hazed deep burnt orange with a thinner but well sustained white head.Aromas are dominated by herbal/citric hop with a caramel sweet malt base as well.Flavors of herbal tea and grapefruit upfront with a hefty caramel toffee malt base,pretty well balanced with the hops winning out slightly.A very good old school IPA with a bit of an English element in it to me,I liked it and will get more.;;;;;;;;;;
"Enjoyed with grassrootsVT at 4 am after he helped me fix my toilet with a knife, a nail, and some silicon...	Appears a pitch black with a 2 finger high, tan head. Tons of lacing is left around the glass.	Smell is of coffee grounds, cocoa, fresh espresso beans, roasted nuts, creamy vanilla.	Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a huge nod to ground coffee and not enough of the oak, or bourbon going on as anticipated.	Mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, rich, huge coffee, sweet, creamy, with a grainy, biscuity feel in the swallow.	Personally, I enjoyed the regular Breakfast Stout more. Maybe it was the bottle? I've heard these have differed.	---	Edit - 5/4/09	I finally got this on tap at Capone's. Man, this was much better than what I remember it being in the bottle. Plenty of bourbon, vanilla, oak, and cocoa adding to the mocha. The draft version was top notch. 	Bottle notes...	A - 4.5	S - 4.5	T - 4	M - 4	D - 4";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip 08/11/10. I've been looking forward to this one for awhile.		Pours completely black. A rough pour coaxes up a small tan head which settles to a narrow ring along the perimeter of the glass. 		The aroma is incredible on this beer. Coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and wood almost completely manage to mask the alcohol which lingers nicely in the background.		Chocolate on the entry and more coffee as is progresses across the palate. Seems there's a fairly prominent hop flavors for the style which actually seems to enhance the bitter sharpness of the coffee character. Of course alcohol comes through on the aftertaste in a beer as strong as this but it's relatively subtle and adds a pleasant warming. I let it warm quite a bit before sampling but even more chocolate and an almost dark fruity character start coming through as it completes the journey to room temperature.		Carbonation is very low but that's not really a huge problem for me in this style. Wish the body was a bit fuller but I'm not going to sweat the details too much as this is a very enjoyable beer.		What's this? A Bourbon barrel aged Stout that allows the barrel influence to do it's work without drowning out the base beer? What a concept! Founders never seems to disappoint and this is among their top offerings I've tried so far.";;;;;;;;;;
"Batch 5 suckaz. Drank for the AFC & NFC championship games. Go Pack!		'Light' black color, red edge to it, minimal brown tan head. Aroma was soft, mild bourbon, mild chocolate, no coffee. 		Taste, I really dug this, like Eclipse, it wasn't trying to be the biggest baddest largest most alcoholic stout in the world, a light amount of bourbon to compliment the beer. Good complimentary chocolate with the bourbon, heat is kept to a small warming sensation, a desireable one at that.		Really amazed hoppin frog makes such good stouts, and such lousy ipa's, but could totally be a freshness thing getting their beer all the way out here.";;;;;;;;;;
500 mL German bottle, with probably the prettiest label of the lineup - served in a weizen glass. It pours a murky, sedimented brownish/amber - like leather - with medium carbonation and a three finger head that leaves light lacing. It smells quite unique, with bubblegum, beechwood smoke, and fruit (banana and citric notes), with green hops and tobacco. I love the smoke/hefe combo. There are flavors of bacon and beechwood, tobacco, and hints of wheat and tartness in the back. It has a big upfront flavor, but a fairly light aftertaste for what it is. The body is medium yet full and quite smooth with light enough carbonation and a medium finish. A very interesting brew, and maybe not the best from Heller, but, like all of their products, definitely worth a try.;;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.		Appearance - Copper colored with remarkably little head. Almost no lacing either.		Smell - The hop aroma is excellent. Fruity, citrusy aromas. Maybe a bit of a tart aroma, if I'm describing it correctly. The caramel malt comes through behind the hops. Smells delicious. It does get a bit musty as it warms, though.		Taste - A bit underwhelming considering the aroma. Hop flavor to start, but backs off quickly. Maybe a bit one-dimensional. Good, but nothing amazing. Very little alcohol in the taste, more in the warming after the sip. Bitterness is accentuated as it warms.		Mouthfeel - Strong carbonation. Maybe a bit dry in the finish, but a good body to it otherwise.		Overall - Tasty, but nothing I'd seek out over other IPAs.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.;;Appearance: Bright and lively golden amber orange with lots of bubbles and a solid three finger white head with good retention. Lots of sticky lacing around the glass. ;;Smell: A sweet and hoppy mix. Cascade citrus hops and some floral pine hops with a good amount of sweet bready malts with caramel and toffee. Light hint of honey.Hops and malts smell very balanced. ;;Taste: Starts with a taste of hops that are both floral and citrus driven with hints of pine. Some sweet bready caramel malts follow. Light hints of honey and lemon. Overall taste is considerably milder than what is typical of an American pale ale. ;;Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Crisp and smooth. Slightly watery. ;;Overall: This is a fairly tasty and decent pale ale but the taste and body isn't quite full enough to be a true representation of an American pale ale. The flavors that are present are pretty good. Its more like a light version of a pale ale.
"Appearance: Pours a deep vermillion, with a frothy purple head that leaves a web of lace		Smell: Raspberry syrup with just a hint of Belgian yeast		Taste: Rich raspberry pure, starting out sweet and building in tartness by mid-palate, when some yeast complexity enters the picture; after the swallow, the flavors meld together, with a puckering tartness on the finish		Mouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation		Overall: Although I might have preferred a bit more tartness or yeasty funk, this is still a very nice example of what can be done with a fruit beer";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz. bottle into glass pint.	40F		$1.50 / ea.		A: Hazy deep copper body topped with a big rocky tan head of excellent retention that leaves thick creamy lace and the cover is like looking down at the clouds.		S: Grapefruit citrus hits the nose immediately, followed by spicy bread character with hints of maple and raisin. Complex, interesting, and appealing.		T: Spicy and bready. Strong malt character with a toasted quality that gives way pine hops. Well balanced, and a very palatable aftertaste.		M: Medium body with medium carbonation. Rounded smoothness compliments of the hop oil, but a noticeable carbonic bit that helps the maintain a crisp quality.		D: Wonderfully drinkable from start to finish and beyond. Great flavor, and crisp, clean finish.		O: Very good selection from a great brewery. One of my favorite session beers.";;;;;;;;;;
A very agreeable and smooth pale ale with rounded contours and graceful fruitiness. Bittering is gently restrained for purposes of balance only  hop flavor is not emphasized. Both the pale amber color and the breezy fragrance suggest apricot. Low CO2 with scant showing of suds. A downright friendly beer worthy of your daily regimen.;;;;;;;;;;
"Picked up a single for $4, with a bottling date of 10/27/09		Poured from the brown stubby, with a now pop cap, no more twist off's. Went into a pub glass forming an inch of tan head. The beer is s pretty dark brown, showing reddish auburn highlights when held to the lamp. The forming head and carbonation mixture off the pour was also interesting to watch, allot of color there. 	Head retention is a thick collar with foamy bubbles on the cap. Lace is sticky and coats the glass well.		Aroma is bourbon, wood, mild hops in the form of pine. Loads of dark sugar and burnt caramel malt in there. Buttery almost, in a caramelized butter sugar combination. Mild vanilla and maple syrup. 		Man, this is one rich sipper. Some boozy warmth from the barrels, still plenty of sweetness shinning through. Bitters creep along with toasted wood and deep into the distance hops bite and linger. Loads of burnt caramel and some cereal grains. A touch of chocolate and vanilla, something in there is reminding me of dark Belgian candy sugar also.	Warmth into the linger after the swallow, not hot, just your very distant bourbon throat warming.		Mouthfeel is bordering a syrup slickness with just a little carbonation keeping any flat feel at bay. 		This is tremendous!";;;;;;;;;;
"A- 12 oz bottle poured into a mug. Beer is a bright orange-gold and translucent, hazy. The beer sports a small head which quickly fades and leaves minimal lacing. Really noticeable carbonation.		S- A myriad of tropical fruits. Orange, melon, lemon, and even pineapple. Citric hop aroma. Sweetness.		T- Extreme grapefruit, with some orange and lemon are apparent in the initial citrus hop taste. This is followed quickly by some standard maltiness, but not nearly enough to balance the flavor of this beer (not necessarily bad for an IPA). A dry finish with lots of hop bitterness. No alcohol flavor is detectable.		M- Medium-full body, with a little more carbonation than I usually like in an IPA.		D- Great flavor but high abv in this brew. Hard for me to drink more than 2 in a night, but those 2 sure go down easy.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appears a light gold with plenty of carbonation pumping away and a small 1 finger head. Smell is of light malt and hops. Taste is decent. This isn't my favorite style but I like it. Very crisp with a sweet malt and crisp hop bite that finishes dry. 		It's ok, dog.";;;;;;;;;;
"Gold capped bottle (guessing an early batch)	Glad to finally try this one!		Pours black as hell with a thin layer of light caramel colored head. Some spotty lacing exists along the glass. 		The nose has a hefty amount of whiskey involved, followed by sweet vanilla, caramel, oak, roasted malt and a bit of bitter chocolate.		The taste is a sweet treat form outer space. I am graciously welcomed with a sweet blast of vanilla and bitter cocoa all mixed together with a lightly heated booze presence. There is a charred oak presence that brings on a nice roastiness. The whiskey has really done a number on this brew as all the barrel characteristics shine quite hard.		The mouthfeel has a decent amount of crisp carbonation despite the barrel-aging. This is a deeply viscous brew that is syrup like but not cloying in sweetness. 		Overall, this is a prime example of how barrel aging can change a great beer into an even better one. Love this brew and cant wait for more";;;;;;;;;;
Clear golden color with a thin white lace for a head. The aroma is grainy with a hint of hop spice and alcohol. Clean light body and a good amount of carbonation. Grain sweetness, mild hop spice, and a very clean finish. Not bad, just an all around drinkable lager. Best when paired with a heavy meal.;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;
I absolutely love this beer. Founders has done very well with this one being that I have not yet had the honor to try a KBS or a Canadian breakfast. This is one of my go-to beers that i always seem to have in my cellar. Believe you me this is a beer that is relatively easy to get and yet if it was as rare as some of the other beers on here it might be higher rated than it already is. Do yourself a favor if you hace not tried this and go get one.;;;;;;;;;;
"Oh, yum!	Pours pitch black with a half finger of very thick dark tan foam that melts pretty slowly in my glass.	Aromas are thickly coffee and dark chocolate.	Flavor is fantastic. Dark sweet chocolate moves to dark cream and coffee then back to dark sweet chocolate and melting towards some dark candied fruits then alcohol.	Mouthfeel is wonderfully creamy., full,..and smooth.	Aftertaste is chocolate and dark fruit with the alcohol warming your chest.	Love this Imperial Stout.";;;;;;;;;;
"A .5 L bottle served in a Troegenator seidel.		A: The lager is a pale yellow color, as though a few precious drops of yellow dye slipped into a glass of water. The color reminds me of the middling mixture of an Arnold Palmer, where the lemonade and tea blend together. Head is minimal and there is no lace.		S: The nose is quite subtle, emitting a soft grainy aroma that is nicely punched up by the Bamberg smoked malts.		T: Much like the nose, the taste is strong with its smoked element, creating a light smokehouse flavor. That flavor is drying, similar to the salty dryness that accompanies a nice smoked ham. The smoke masks a a smooth grainy biscuit flavor that adds a touch of sweetness to the mix. The finish is crisp, a well-made lager enhanced by the smoke.		M: The taste is crisp and the kiss of smoke adds a level of depth that even the most extreme beers can fail to grasp. 		D: With an abv below 5%, this is one hell of a session drink. The smoke only helps things, making this a veritable meal in a cup.";;;;;;;;;;
"Clear and golden color, nice head. Smells very, fresh hops and light malts. Very clean and crisp tasting. Excellent balance, very fresh hops balance and dry out the toasted malts. Well bittered through the finish. I'd like the body to be a touch lighter, but imminently drinkable.		 Excellent pils, though perhaps not as interesting as it could be. That said, far better than some of the over the top american versions i've had.";;;;;;;;;;
What a tremendous wet hopped beer! This should be the standard. A diificult effort while working with fresh wet hops, Founders has again achieved greatness. This beer is more like a fresh resiny tea of hops than anything else I've tasted. This is a notch better than the Great Divide.;;;;;;;;;;
Tried this on a whim because of the odd looking bottle and name. ;;Pours a cloudy golden color with a thin wisp of head. Has a faint hop smell. Taste is very crisp and there's a definite apple taste to it. Each sip is very refreshing and the apple flavoring adds a nice little touch.. a pretty solid english pale ale.;;;;;;;;
"Consumed 6/17/11		Appearance: Copper/amber with some orange, above-average lacing follows a nice, fluffy head		Smell: Hoppy - citrus, mostly grapefruit, lemon and orange rinds - dry, herbal, floral hops - bready malts that seem to be on the light side		Taste: Solid - very hoppy - primarily a dry citrus flavor, with dried out grapefruit and orange peels - kind of spicy, kind of herbal, kind of floral - (clearly) intentionally unbalanced, the malts are very pale, but manage to adequately provide a backbone - dry and bready		Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, kind of oily/sticky despite being so dry, not ideal		Overall: Very good, but not epic		Perhaps I had my expectations too high for this one. It is a great IPA, but it is not exactly what I am looking for in an IPA. It's too herbal and borderline one-dimensional for the hop flavors. Regardless, it's definitely worth a try.";;;;;;;;;;
Quite simply one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Pours a dark cloudy amber with an amber/beige head. The aroma is dominated by the hops providing a scent of pure bitter earthiness. Also, there is a very slight citrus aroma that is very hard to detect because of all of the hops. This beer is extremely bitter but is balanced out nicely with a nice amount of sweet citrus flavor. This is a hop head wet dream 165 IBUs. What?! Criminaly underrated.;;;;;;;;;;
"Nice grassy hop aroma. Some citrus notes too. Behind all the hops is a nice grainy malt aroma. I get some sweet tofee malt notes too.		Pours with a smallish head, but what's there lasts through the pint. Light rising carbonation bubbles. Really nice amber/orange color and very clear.		Really good malt profile is what I notice first (which I dig since I like balance) then a powerful dose of bitter hops. Lots of toffe flavors and just a hint of diacetyl on later sips. Also good grassy hop flavor. The aftertaste is a nice combo of bitter hop oils and sweet.		Body is a little thin, more of a standard pale ale feel. Carbonation level is a little low but then it's a growler so that's normal.		Very dinkable IPA. Both hoppy and well balanced. I would definitely recommend it.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks for dob for this Michigan treat!		A-2 inch head on clear amber/copper body, streaming carbo bubble from bottle of Sam Adams imperial pilsner glass. Very nice looking!	S-Citrus/grapefruit and a nice pine aroma. 	T-Pine and cirus hope flavor on a fairly seet malt base. As warm, more floral and caramel come through.	M-Nice mouth feel, slightly oily and full in mouth	D-I'm a fan. Could drink quite a few. Not quite a top flight IPA but one I would seek out again.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a deep brown with a white head that settles to a thick collar of foam. The aroma is wonderful, with cocoa, rum, a bit of licorice, a hit of prunes and raisins. The taste is at first sweet with an anise-like dryness towards the finish which is long, lactic, more bitter and drier than I expected. The warmth of alcohol is noticeable in the finish. The mouthfeel is quite luxurious, the body is full, but at no point is this beer cloying. The slight lactic finish is particularly interesting in this beer and I enjoy it very much. This bottle seems very fresh with bright bitterness in the finish. I would to pick up some of this and let it mature a little more in the bottle and see what happens.	It was good to find this beer on the shelf again in time for winter.";;;;;;;;;;
Very nice, deep red color. Nice tight white head on top. Somewhat malty and coppery aroma to it. Deep, deep malt flavor. Very soft tasting. Slight hop bitterness to it. Good blend of a caramel and toasted flavor. Nice body-very filling yet not heavy. Very, very drinkable beer. A real winner in my book. The caramel sweetness blends the whole thing right together. Nice...;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a dirty, oily brown; pretty heavy body to the eye. No head, but white lace.		The smell is intimidating. Before I taste, I feel this is one of those beers that doesn't want to mask the alcohol.		Oh man, this is definetly a sipper. Has a good touch of carbonation, and burns like a mother. Very earthy and dry, coats the mouth with that numbing alcohol feel/taste.		Probably wouldn't drink more than one, but it's quite impressive.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: The beer is jet black in color and poured with a thin tan head that almost instantaneously dissipated leaving a thin ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass.	S: There are strong aromas of whiskey in the nose from the barrel aging.	T: The taste is quite rich and has flavors of bittersweet chocolate, coffee beans and roasted malts. Notes of alcohol become evident in the finish as the beer warms up.	M: It feels full-bodied and a bit thin on the palate with a low amount of carbonation. There is a moderate amount of alcohol warming in the finish.	D: The beer is rather drinkable because the alcohol is relatively well masked and the flavors of whiskey are well incorporated into the taste.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Dark brown body, yeast clumps visible at the bottom of the glass. Nice tan head, about 3/4"" very slow fade.		Smell: Smells more porter than smoke, but the smoke accentuates the dark chocolate and bunrt notes.		Taste: A mild tasting porter, and the smoke isn't bad. The porter does seem underpowered, but does have a nice chocolate flavor. Not overdone, which is good.		Mouthfeel: Thin and watery, needs more body.		Drinkability: Not bad for a smoked beer, not annoying whatsoever. A week after having Stone Smoked Porter this beer does show it's faults, though.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a very nice ruby color with two fingers of white head.		Scent of hops, rye, and ripe fruit. A balanced and bitter scent, I like it.		Taste of strong rye, hops, ripe fruit, and grass. The rye flavor is a little strong to have multiple glasses of this in one session, but I will enjoy that one glass while it is there.		Mouthfeel is light bodied with good carbonation.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Pours a pretty clear caramel color with a sturdy light beige head that retains nicely and delivers more than a few strands of lace		Smell: A bit of caramel, some roast and a hint of hazelnuts		Taste: Opens with a brown bread flavor, with a sprinkling of chocolate dust; some hops add a bitter balance by mid-palate; after the swallow, both vanilla and nutty flavors dominate		Mouthfeel: Medium body and moderate carbonation		Drinkability: A really nice beer for a style which is often quite boring; it has complexity and, although just a tad too sweet on the finish, is enjoyable to drink		Thanks, kirok1999, for the opportunity";;;;;;;;;;
"P: Thank you to my big sister and her family for turning me onto the Ontario Craft Brewers' Discovery Pack No. 2: 6 assorted bottles. All the way from Toronto. Nice Christmas gift, EH?	#3 in a series.		A: Pours a dark mahogany with ruby flarings when directed at the light. Minimal white head dissipates immediately before settling to a paisley island of foam. 		S: Interesting aroma: Toasted malt with suggestions of coffee, butterscotch, and green apple. 		T: Opens mildly sweet with a surprisingly bitter bite. Continues with notes of caramel malt, toffee, butterscotch, and coffee. Finishes dry with a trace of vanilla. 		M: Extremely thin-bodied mouthfeel, bordering on watery with pronounced carbonation on the tongue.		D: Its light-bodied nature makes this Irish Red Ale easy to drink. A complex nose and interesting taste profile provide enough character for session drinking.";;;;;;;;;;
"I've had this a few times not on cask and it was ok, but on cask it was much better. The cask was tapped that day too, so its super fresh. 		A- Very dark black, with a milk chocolate brown head. 		S- The smell of chocolate and vanilla, along with a slight smell of coffee.		T- The taste was great, the vanilla comes though nicely. This has a nice balance with not being too sweet. The chocolate that is there is great and creamy. There is a slight bitterness to it as well that helps keep it extra tasty. 		M- Soft, silky and creamy. The carbonation is spot on, very balanced.		D- Easy to drink to say the least.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured a cloudy brown color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger creamy tan head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, with some nice notes of coffee/toffee. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, and some nice coffee notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very nice brew, recommended.;;;;;;;;;;
"From notes 9-16-08		Eye: Pretty good looking overall. Creamy head at about a  finger. Color is really quite nice on this one. The best way to describe it is copper with a crystal clear body and lively and delicate carbonation. I can also describe the color as being extremely light nut brown with amber, orange and yellow all mixed in. Just from the way this one looks I can tell that it is not an American style. Head retention needs some work, as I sit here writing it falls to a semi-thick/thin old blanket close to rotting which covers the beer. Lacing is thin but solid (as far as forming a sheeting effect on the glass). 		Nose: Pretty weak overall aroma. Slight and almost hidden caramel notes with some diacetyl in there as well. Also a bit of sweet candy type of phenol/ester-like butterscotch backed by vanilla. Hop aroma is low. If everything were a bit more pronounced I'd be happy with it. 		Tongue: Quite a malt driven beer. Not much to hops here, just enough to balance the sweetness with bitterness. I would say that there is pretty much no hop flavor here. Much the same as the aroma-weak caramel notes. Not very complex at all. However, this beer does have a huge sweet malt profile, I mean the sweetness of this beer is unbelievable. I've never tasted anything quite like this from a beer before. Big vanilla notes, at least that's what I get. To me it tastes a lot like a generic Cream Soda, its that sweet and vanilla like. Some oakiness, or earthy/woody type flavors too. 		Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium-light on the palate with a dry finish. Carbonation is delicate and is not over the top. In my opinion its level is just near perfect, it compliments the sweetness of this beer quite well. This is one I'll definitely pick up again, I really like this beer, its turned me back on to English styles. Unlike some of the English Ales I've had this one is not packed full of diacetyl...a characteristic I don't find all that appealing. Overall a well made beer, and one that I'll give another go round to.";;;;;;;;;;
Oil black body is thick and beautiful. It hosts a inch of milk chocolate colored head. Zesty bold smokey malt is invigorating to the nose. Hints of chocolate, bacon, and black licorice exist. Enters the mouth much more thin and lighter in body than expected. Nice even richness arives in the middle of the palate. Also evokes a slight, welecomed bitter twords the end. Develops better as it warms a bit. Nice thick mouthfeel includes a hint of yeasty sour hue. Very easy to drink for such a hugely dark brew.;;;;;;;;;;
This brew is darker than my keyboard I am using to type this review. Hits you with the coffee notes and oatmeal notes up front and throughout. A totally remarkable brew. So smooth and full of warmth. I have a couple four packs left and cannot wait to enjoy them all. I just cannot believe this beer is mixed so perfect. A must for any stout drinker and next year I am loading up. Best stout I have ever had.;;Cheers;;;;;;;;
"Dated: N/A	From LCBO, 500ml		G: Chalice		A: Dark opaque red body with one finger of off white head. Head dissipates rather quickly, but leaves decent lacing.		S: Strong aromas of hickory, raw bacon and burnt wood. This is not something you'd want to smell everyday in a drink, but it doesn't scream breakfast. 		T: Follows the aromas quite well but not as strong. Smoked hickory and bacon dominate this brew. I get some sweet maltiness in the back too. I was expecting it to taste strong, but I'm glad it didn't because that would be overkill.		M: Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Silky smooth in the mouth and leaves a dry-smoky aftertaste. 		D: I wouldn't be able to drink this unless I'm in the mood for it. As a breakfast beer paired with the obvious bacon I could see this being even better. All in all, it tastes good and if you like or want to try out a smoked beer this is the one.";;;;;;;;;;
"Hot night, decided on a little fruity beer to start the weekend.		A - Popped a bottle and poured into a couple of New Glarus flute glasses. Garnett red with a fizzy pour producing a small head that quickly turns into a bubble party.		S - Farily non-descript. Not a cherry blast by any means. 		T - Pretty uneventful with a fizzy cherry profile and lots of carbonation. Closest thing in awhile that I have had in a glass that reminded me of the old Pop Rocks candy. 		M - Thin, lots of carbonation.		D - Light, crisp, and pretty refreshing.		Not bad for what it is. Does not hold a candle to other cherry fruit beers like Wisc Belg Red.";;;;;;;;;;
"A: Poured bronze color with great carbonation leaving a billowing white head.		S: Hints at English malts, plenty of citrus, mainly orange peel, some graprefuit and pine 		T: Big hops and booze sting. Just what I like. The English barley in this provides a good, unique taste and tremendous balance. Caramel, tad pine but mainly grapefruit and other citrus on this.		M: Medium bodied, well carbonated, plenty of hop oil and still a hop backed, dry booze sting		D: Damn good!";;;;;;;;;;
"A: The appearance is a light yellow honey colour with some white head retention.	S: Smells strongly of pine and citrus hops	T: The taste of this beer is not extraordinary for me. I found the hops impressive but the malt backbone was very weak. I know some hop heads love this, but I feel that the beer comes off a little too bitter and dry.	D: The overall drinkability is decent. Double Trouble is a great beer for the hop head that likes a beer of straight hops and little malts. I personally would rather drink a Surly Abrasive or Bell's Hopslam.";;;;;;;;;;
"I really didn't think I was going to like this beer as much as I did. Really great garnet color. Initially has a puffy off white head that fades fast to a tiny loose ring. Aroma is a little faint, but sweet and bready. 	Taste is really malt forward with strong toffee, caramel, molasses flavors that are abundant. That leaves your palate with a faint hop bitterness and slight alcohol hottness. Could be a little more lively in the mouth, but has good body none-the-less. After a while I'm sure this would get cloying but for one bottle its great.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into a 6 oz snifter at Toronado BWine Festival 2008.	Poured nice with a decent white head. Nose was of sugar, big hops, candy and lots of that peated malt. Taste is perfect for barley wine.Very well balanced but a big beer. Mouthfeel also was dynomite!!";;;;;;;;;;
"On-tap at MBC in pint glass. Dark, dark beer, no light getting through this one. Nice light half centimeter head that lingers and a full coffee nose with a hint of sweetness.		Taste was quite good and compliments the smell of this fine example of the style. Mouthfeel was excellent and overall a very drinkable beer and nothing so rich that you wouldn't want another if you were of a mind.";;;;;;;;;;
"This is one fine IPA that I have the privilege to sample thanks to a trade with Pudge43 (excellent beer trader here).		Poured into a Duvel tulip this beer is a muldled brown to dark copper in color. Poured with a 1/2 inch head which reduced to a fine lace which remains (off white in color).		The aroma is dry and fresh. I can imagine a cool breeze and the smell of springtime in the air. 		Taste is extremely dry and just like the aroma is of fresh hop moderately citrus in the front followed by light sweetness in the mouth which subsides to a tartlike citrus aftertaste...absolutely delicious.		The mouthfeel is ligher than I expected at 7.2% abv but is nearly perfect for the style. Not too oily, not too thin...just about right.		You could probably drink this all day; I know I could. As you finish one it begs for a repeat and you know you will have to follow it by an IPA or APA with similar notes because perfection demands perfection. You are forced to either have another Centennial or upgrade (which will inevitably be extremely difficult) - best to grab another Centennial. Cheers!";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Pours a cloudy, yet pale, golden colour with a paper thin layer of head which dissipates rather quickly and leaving no real lacing.		S - Scents are complex, but the bananas and cloves are the strongest, bit of pine hops also noticeable, and a spicy pepper finish.		T - Wow, pleasantly surprised by this one. The fruit flavours (bananas, pears and apple) are not overpowering, which is nice, and the spices (cloves, nutmeg, coriander and cinnamon) create a nice balance. The finish is a bit grainy and wheaty, but by no means a turn off, and obviously a requirement for this style.		M - The pour gave the impression it might be a little syropy, but it was pretty light and went down smooth.		D - Pretty tasty. Much less fruity than I was expecting, and I really liked how the spices balanced this one out. Would I pick up another bomber of this, probably, but I'm not rushing out to get it. Overall, would recommend this to any witbier fan, as the flavours are unique.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle from 2011 release (I cannot for the life of me locate the inkjet bottled on date), drank from a snifter. The beer poured a deep dark piano-black, and initially seemed like it wasn't going to have much of a head. Then it was like a mad scientist's experiment, with black jets of bubbles shooting up towards the surface. After a few moments it settled into a beautiful 2 1/2 finger choclotey-brown head, which left wonderful lacing as it receded.		The aroma was full of sweet and roasted malts, fresh Starbuck's coffee, rich chocolate cake and a little bit of hops. The taste was phenomenal. Bitter dark chocolate, roasted bready malts, a little bit of alcohol, some hop bitterness and iced coffee. It was very well carbonated, a medium to full body and a mouth-coating creaminess. This was the freshest I've ever had FIS, and it was truly a wonderful experience. Three thumbs up!";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured a hazy apricot color with profound white creamy head. Great retention and attractive lacing.	Smell presents with much citrusy and grassy hops with somme sweet malt lurking in the background.	Taste is dominated by the hops, grassy and citrusy, and the malt balances them well.	Nice finish with a nice dry feeling that beckons for another taste.	Vety nice beer, refreshing and tasty.";;;;;;;;;;
"This is a quick review as I am balancing a sleeping baby with this computer, sorry (if anyone actually reads this).		I poured this beer from a 16 ounce bottle into a pint glass. A pretty good amount of head (about a finger and a half). I pick up the standard flavor of the red in the aroma, along with some hoppiness.		This is a very good balance of flavors. The hoppiness comes through with what seems like would be a pretty good red on it's own. The red creates bitterness that resides in the after-taste, but that is normal for reds.		This is a good beer. If you see it, I recommend it as a good pairing to red meat or pizza (without being too heavy). Just be careful, the ABV is high for this time of year.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours into chalice a deep amber with an amber head that reduces to a fine lacing. Has a great aroma, orange peel, pineapple and sweet malts. Taste was orange, pineapple and a sweet maltness with a hint of hops and a good full medium body. Aftertaste has good clean crisp sweet finish.	My new favorite from Founders. They have done an excellent job of masking the 13% ABV behind an outstanding taste and body. Well balanced and highly recommended.";;;;;;;;;;
A: A beautiful copper red color with a nice one finger head that settles nicely. No lace.;;S: Hop aromas are a bit more muted on draft than from the bottle. There is still a nice dose of hops though with hints of pine and spicey rye.;;T: Nice balance of biscuit malt and hops. The hops are mostly pine with hints of spice from the rye.;;M: Medium in body fairly dry throughout.;;D: I liked it in a bottle and I like it on draft. Founders make some real good brews.;;
Very nice color and head. The nose had a really nice sweet biscuity smell with a real nice malty base and floural hop hint. Taste seemed a bit subdued on the hop side for an ESB. Nice malty flavors but nothing jumped ouit at me. Hop flavors were very tame with some mild floural undertones. There were tiny particulates sitting in suspension in the entire beer, not sure what that was all about. Overall not very complex and I was hopping to have more of a hop element.;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into pint glasses with Fr. Ian (Who also supplied the bottle. Thank you!)		A: Semi-thick looking pour that did not have much in the way of head formation. I am sure that it had warmed up sufficiently during the ride home. The color is very dark brownish-red. 		S: This smells like an RIS. Dark chocolate, roasty malts, good heat in the nose leading towards a touch of sharp/sour grains. I don't pick out much in the way of hops. 		T: Very nice chocolate and dark fruit. Excellent dose of hops bitterness. Very well balanced.		M: Incredibly smooth and round on the tongue.		D: Very, very easy to make this one disappear.";;;;;;;;;;
This was probably the best of the four beers available at the Moon River outpost in Cartersville. It leans more toward hop bitterness than hop flavor than I prefer in an IPA, but it was still a tasty beer. There was a good bit of a fruitines something like dried apricots, grassy hops and a touch of sweet malt. The flavor had grapefruit-rind bitterness backed up by a pleasant fruitiness and a touch of malt. Pretty tasty.;;;;;;;;;;
"A: Very dark brown during the pour but looks to be pitch black once in the glass completely. Aggressive pour yielded a solid near 2 finger lasting almond colored head. 4.5		S: Smell is really malty sweet. Intense dark fruits consisting predominantly of raisins, maybe dates or plums some toffee and some light roastiness. 4		T&M: Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a slightly higher than average viscosity for the style. Carbonation is pretty much dead on. Taste is sweet, dark malty goodness. Lots of toffee, raisin flavors, similar to that experienced on the nose. Roast is very subtle but there and provides a nice addition to the insane malt profile. Definitely not balanced, but thats kind of what I like about Baltic Porters. Sweet, but not cloying. Very enjoyable. 4/4.5		O: Doesnt have the complexity of Olfrabrikken, but damn if this isnt a good Baltic Porter. For $2.99 for 500ml you cant really go wrong. I think this is my first Polish beer too. 4";;;;;;;;;;
"Damn, if I didn't wait all year for this monster.	V.06	Ink in a 12oz. snifter. Thin, chocolate head. 	 Kona! Stout! This could have some other definition, but it decided not to.	Big, robust coffee zing with a tart, bittered finish.	Chewy, and very pleasant creaminess.	Tremendous offering from an awesome brewery.	Nicely done!";;;;;;;;;;
"I had this at Manny Brown's in Newtown PA(mailing address says Langorne)		Anyway pours an black cloudy color with a coffee colored heading thick with some nice to that ass.		Nose is immediate of a ridiculous amount of coffee and very rich chocolate's.A nice big bite of maltiness stays with you throughout. Unlike any beer I've ever smelled.		Taste is just simply awesome very smooth,slick with a great deal of coffee goodness and some caramel,also a slight spicy hoppiness to it.Unlike anything I've ever tasted.		All and All a great beer.Did I say Unlike anything I've ever tasted before in my life. I am glad I bought this.";;;;;;;;;;
"Founder's Breakfast Stout. 12 fl. oz. 8.3%	Picked up today! Poured into my Boulevard goblet.		Large baby eating oatmeal on the bottle. Somewhat scary, actually.		Pours absence-of-light black. An effervescent oatmeal-colored head sits like cream atop.		The nose is fresh coffee after hiking in a storm in the Ozarks. Coffee and 40% cocoa chocolate. This is a fresh and fantastic nose. There is minor oat here, but no more so than other solid coffee stouts. 		Founders Breakfast Stout thunders espresso in the mouth. Chocolate. Coffee beans. This is one a few beers I have with a more dynamic taste than nose. Fresh coffee; what else is there to say? Roasted, bitter finish. Elegance everywhere.		Creamy and medium-full.		Edit: Adjusted score based on 2011 vintage (consumed four days after bottling). 4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5";;;;;;;;;;
"On-tap at BBC on 4th Street. In a wine glass.		A slightly funky pink like ros wine. White head, some lacing.		Smells like, as advertised, a raspberry meade. It's got raspberry, honey, and simple two-row-ish malt. Hints of complexity like honeysuckle and other florals, but nothing significant.		Light and refreshing. Mostly very barley flavored with a strong malt backbone. Honey is next with sweet raspberry. Clean, refreshing.		Not a syrupy as it would have been, but was light enough to not make me feel oversaturated with honey.		For someone who is into this, a second glass would be good. I liked it, but prefer other styles.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz poured to tulip		A: Dark brown, minimal head and lacing. Lots of little bubbles rising from bottom of glass.		S: Smells like sweet booze with hints of oak/vanilla.		T: Sweet, malty, with some caramel or toffee, dark fruit. The oak gives nice hints of underlying vanilla. 		M: nice medium/full bodied beer. Pretty carbonated.		D: Shockingly smooth and drinkable for 10.2%. Obviously you could have a few of these and they would sneak up on you. I think this one is another winner from Founders.";;;;;;;;;;
decent lace. Lots of carbonation, tiny bit of sediment, only real loss of score here would be on the lack of head. Smell was classic Hop Bomb, deep pine resin, with a strong alcohol presence upon first smell, as it warmed some of the more subtle scents started to come through, a slight sugary sweetness and citrus, specifically grapefruit were now there to be found. Overall smell was very nice, not over powering, but did have enough to tingle the nose a bit. Taste was very crisp, clean, and warming. Alcohol was a big factor in the beginning again, with a huge pine hop hit. Letting it warm brings out the malt that was trying to balance it with a bit of sweetness, but is still overpowered by the hops. This was a very good brew, and I am glad I got to try it. A;;;;;;;;;;
"appearance: pours a clear yellowish-orange with moderate carbonation, little foam and very slight foamy lacing.		smell: light harvest scent gives off notes of apple-cinnamon.		taste: harvest malts are faint and subdued, but taste is very clean and refreshing, finishing with a mellow hoppy bitterness with apple-like undertones.		drinkability: for the Mrzen style, it is sudued and not overly prounounced, but in general the very light hop notes complement the mellow taste.";;;;;;;;;;
"Served on tap at TJs in a 10oz glass		Pours a coal black with a really small line of a tan head.		The nose has a strong roast, with a big bourbon back note. The malt is overpowered by the coffee at first, but appears at the end with what I perceive as a hint of vanilla		The bourbon pops out at first, but the coffee roast and malt comes through pretty quickly. The vanilla is there at the end, a sweet touch at the end of the sip.		The finish is powerful and the whole experience is warming and beautiful. A classic beer that is worthy of any quest to find it.";;;;;;;;;;
"pours an alluring mahogany and the nose is straight up boozy.		That is rather pronounced in the flavor, as well, and there is no attempt to mask the 8.2% ABV. Sweet malt, caramel, vanilla, and whiskey come through. Not much hops character at all, just like this style should be.		I really like what Hoppin Frog has done here. Big flavors, true to the style, a very high quality beer. I have had four beers from Hoppin Frog, and all have been very good to great.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a lightly hazed lemony yellow color (almost witbier-ish) with a minimal white head: retention poor. Wheat malt aroma and a little bit of cloviness in the nose and some hints of banana and yeast. Crisp wheat character with some typical hefeweizen qualities, heavier on the phenolic clove than the estery banana. Not really the best hefeweizen I've ever had, but certainly noteworthy. The only fault with this beer is that it feels a slight bit overcarbonated, even furthering the drier finish. Overall, a good hefeweizen, true to its style, and drinkable. I wasn't shocked, but I really couldn't recall that Stoudt's made a hefe. Many of times I bought cases of the Stoudt's in the large bottles and reuse them for homebrewing seeing that the bottles accepted the standard crowns.;;;;;;;;;;
"Pours a crystal clear, well carbonated medium gold, topped with a two finger off-white head. Leaves partial webs of lacing.	Earthy, caramel, light toaste malt, and a light herbal note in the aroma.	Nice lemon/grassy hop up front in the taste, light toasted malt in the background.	Medium bodied, smooth with a good zesty hop bite.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Southern Tier tulip glass. Poured amber orange in color with a thin white frothy white head. The head mainly clung to the edges of the glass but left some decent lacing.		The aroma has a nice floral hoppiness to it. It has a bit more pine then citrus and grapefruit, but all are present. I'm getting a little bready malt to it but the hops are definitely at the forefront of the flavor. 		The taste has a decent amount of bitter pine to it as well. It also has a citrusy, grapefruit and pineapple flavor that comes through more in the finish. The finish also has a moderate bitterness to it as well.		The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's a very nice IPA. I really enjoyed this beer and would buy it again. It wasn't anything fancy, just a well made IPA with some very good hoppy and bitter flavors.";;;;;;;;;;
"Served on nitro tap at Founders brew pub on KBS day.		A: Pours dark brown to black with a  inch super creamy frothy gray head. Looks exactly like Guinness in this form. Huge foamy lacing, draping across the glass. 		S: The nitro dulls the smell a little. The smell now is now reminiscent of a chocolate stout, instead of a huge bourbon barrel monster. Dull chocolate, coffee, no noticeable alcohol or hop presence. 		M/T: Much lighter then regular KBS, making it a super creamy, medium body. The carbonation much more present then KBS in the bottle or on tap. Second wave is all alcohol, this is a pretty hot beer, followed by roasted malts. 		D: With a high APV, couldn't session this one, but the nitro makes it feels much lighter and more manageable then the KBS out of the bottle. I like this version of KBS. A nice twist that might be better than the original? This version does make it more drinkable. KBS is such a huge beer that even though it lost a little with the nitro frothiness, it still is a monster.";;;;;;;;;;
Dark brown with a nice head. A nice fruity smoooth smoked porter. The apple, maple, and hickory smoked malts really come through. They do the smoking on site and it shows. A tad sweet, but balanced well enough to make it good. Another great VT brew... Try Rock Art's Smoked Porter if you come to VT, it's even better!;;;;;;;;;;
"Poured a rich, dark brown color, but where's the head? None there.... minimal lacing, too. Has a robust coffee-ish nose, which really draws you in. Mouthfeel was about medium; not outstanding, nothing detracting from the experience. Lots of roasty malt and coffee flavors. Has a bit of hops showing up at the finish, and it does end on the dry side. Pleasant, lingering aftertaste. Prosit!!		overall: 3.9	appearance: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4		295";;;;;;;;;;
"Appears an opaque black with a small tan head that slowly fades into a mild cap. Scattered spots of lacing are left around the glass.	Smell is of oak, toffee, caramel, cocoa, & mild booze.	Taste echoes the aromas with more of a meat flavor with a touch of booze & coffee notes.	Mouthfeel is smooth, velvetty, warming, n chewy.";;;;;;;;;;
"On tap at the source-into a tulip...		Murky bourbon color...cloudy dark beers tend to remind me of a sewage color unfortunately but this isn't quite that bad. Decent maple-colored finger head - doesn't stick too well...not huge lacing. Looks nice and calm.		The usual suspects here - dried fruits, gingerbread, molasses...slight tinny alcohol burn as well.		Definitely some alcohol burn in there. Dried (and dry-tasting) fruits-prunes, plums and a few raisins. A little austerity of malt here but mostly spicy tones. Decent.		This gets better as it warms. Spice tingles on the palate and keeps it hopping. Finish is a little tight but good.		With warmth this is nice on a cool winter day. Booziness keeps it from sessionability but it's solid.";;;;;;;;;;
"A - Dark brown - black, thin 1/2 finger light brown head, light spotty lacing.		S - Wonderful waves of coffee beans, cocoa, light hops, oatmeal and vanilla.		T - Tons of coffee beans, dark chocolate, bitter hops & roasty malts compete for the middle, with a noticeable amount of alcohol, vanilla and oat finishes it out perfectly.		M - Full bodied, heavy, chewy from the oats.		O - Finally got to try this famous beer, such an amazing work of art! Delicious!";;;;;;;;;;
"I'd been eyeing a six-pack of Founder's Red's Rye at Downtown Wine & Spirits for awhile. I picked one up tonight along with a few other beers. The beer had warmed sufficiently by the time I got home. I served it in my NERAX pint glass.		Appearance: Pours a deep red-orange with good clarity. A massive uncontrolable beige-brown head eventually fades to a thin constant layer. Fluffy lace coats the inside of the glass.		Smell: Floral hops dominate the aroma. Upon swirling sweet fruity and malty aromas appear, including berries and caramel.		Taste: Persistent hoppy bitterness is evident throughout. Sweet caramel malts appear in the center. The finish is slightly spicy.		Mouthfeel: Tingly-carbonation, smooth, medium-bodied and oily.		Drinkability: Very tasty. 		Overall: Red's Rye is well-balanced. The hops are balanced well by sweet malts, but aren't overpowered.";;;;;;;;;;
"12 oz bottle poured into an imperial pint. 5.8% ABV, no date.		A - Mostly clear golden apricot orange color with no bubbles rising up. A two-finger off-white head rises up but lowers fairly quickly to a film and a ring of suds. Ok lace left behind.		S - Smooth and soft hoppy aroma full of floral lupulun gland notes and light citrus. Cascade goodness is all over the nose of this one. A good caramel malt backbone comes out a little more with a nice swirl.		T - Heavy pine resembles a mouthfull of pine tree complete with gooey resin although a lot less painful. Sticky pine hops and a tiny floral hint overwhelms the caramel malt backbone in this.		M - Smooth and medium-bodied with the perfect carbonation finish, Victory is pretty bitter and fairly dry as well. The mouthfeel on this one is almost spot-on.		D - I put a few of these back last night while grilling and they are definitely drinkable. A very nice APA that I've had on tap a few times and seem to enjoy a little more that way. I'm definitely happy to see it in bottles though!";;;;;;;;;;
On Tap at Churchkey.;;A - A golden copper slightly amber body with a medium sized resiliant white head. Great lacing throughout.;;S - The nose had some great tropical and citrus notes on the front with some pine coming in in the middle to back end. The malt was evident but didn't overtake the crisp bright citrus notes.;;T & M & D - Bold citrus and tropical fruits on the front end that are backed by a sizable pine pressence. Much like the nose the taste is strong and complex. The beer finishes with a good level of full palate bitterness without clearing all flavor. The beer is medium to full in body and carries a great flavor profile throughout.;;O - A very good offering from Foounders. I enjoy the bold hop flavor and the complexity of both nose and taste. ;;#NAME?
"12 ounce bottle, served in a Sam Adams pint glass at refrigerator temperature.		A: Pours a clear honey-amber body with a 1/2"" head that drops rather quickly to a thin film with a fat blob in the center of the glass.		S: Crisp citrus hop up front, with a bit of resinous hops to follow. Light malts are in the background and become stronger as it warms. 		T: Citrus hops, fresh and dry, with light malt sweetness and a touch of orange peel.		M: Medium-light bodied, with quite low carbonation tingle and a subtle hop bite.		D: Perfect way to finish off a hot day. I couldn't get enough of these today.";;;;;;;;;;
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a deep opaque brown/black. Bottle conditioned. Quickly dissipating head, not much carbonation. Hickory smoke in the aroma with a little sausage and coffee. Aroma fades with time.		Starts off a little on the sweet side. Moderate smokiness. Lingering finish of chocolate malt. Medium body.		This might be a good introduction to smoked beers, not too overpowering with the smoke.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into SA tulip glass. Color is oil and hot tar, thin brown head, with oily lacing.		Nose is burnt oak, vanilla, bourbon, plums, and raisin. Notes of cream, espresso roast coffee, and sweet alcohol. 		Palate is bombarded with a silky-slick bitterness followed by a deep molasses, maltiness. After taste reminds me of a caffeinated Yoohoo which leaves a warm, alcohol finish. Mouth is left a bit tart.		A very nice offering and glad I was fortunate to run across a couple of these gems. Despite my three year old knocking over my glass, I really enjoyed this one. It's not my favorite style but the complexities and unique taste make it really good.";;;;;;;;;;
This beer is expensive but well worth it. It has an excellent brown body with amber tone. There is average head but the lace has a lot of staying power. It has strong aroma of bourbon roasted malt it is very rich. It has candy and bourbon flavor with wood, caramel and some vanilla esters. The mouthfeel is medium with some burn. A very good desert or night cap beer;;;;;;;;;;
"Galaxy Oat is served up a fairly deep amber. The pour does not have a very large head, but the small amount has nice retention and good lacing.		The aroma is fairy subtle for an IPA, but has some nice caramel sweetness as well as citrusy hops and sweet, fruity aromas. The blend of orange, grapefruit, blossoms and zesty fruitiness is quite appetizing.		The flavor is very interesting. Citrusy and bright with a nice fruity floral flair to it. The malt backbone is pretty standard, but ample and well proportioned. Supposedly galaxy hops have a passion fruit like flavor to them. I am not sure if I get passion fruit exactly, but I definitely enjoy the overall fruity character that this beer has.		Mouthfeel is on the upper side of medium. I would not call it smooth, but it is not as invigorating as I would expect from a beer this hoppy. It has a nice semi-dry finish that leaves pleasant hop flavors after swallowing.		Overall I was very impressed with this brew. It hit all the right checks for a beer of this type and had a little extra kick to it. Founders tends to do a great job with hoppy brews like this, and Galaxy Oat is no exception.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bottle to pint glass.		Appearance - Nice copper color with a two finger head. Head retention is quite good and lace is nice.		Smell - Citrus and strong pine notes with a little bit of earthy smell. Very nice on the nose.		Taste - Hop taste comes across pretty strong with an orange/grapefruit taste. It thins out quite a bit about mid-way through and isn't quite as big as I was expecting. The middle/end of each sip has an aspirin like quality that lingers for a while.		Mouthfeel - Medium bodied. Carbonation is decent, but not great.		Overall - Not my favorite beer for the style, but a good brew. This was my very first Founders beer, I'll certainly try any others that I can get my hands on.";;;;;;;;;;
Poured into straight pint glass. Poured with thin, dark tan head that dissipated quickly, leaving a medium amount of lacing. The expected malt notes were less than anticipated in the aroma. A balanced hop presence was also noticed. The flavors followed the aroma closely. I found the flavors of this beer to be not as bold as I had expected, a pleasing surprise. The body was a little thin for the style, although this did not detract from the enjoyment. Very drinkable, would be an excellent companion for your favorite board game or darts. Overall, not the expected winter warmer but a very pleasant beer.;;;;;;;;;;
"This beer pours a dark black with a dark brown head that settles down to a nice ring around my glass. 		The smell is of coffee, bourban, chocolate, burnt malt. Excellent aroma. 		The flavor is very complex. First you get a bit of coffee presence in the front but it is fought off with the bourban nose. The middle is a lot of chocolate and roasted malt. The finish is a mixture of bourbon, chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and i think even a hint of caramel. All of these flavors just blend together perfectly. 		The mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation. Very creamy with fine carbonation. Seems to get creamier as it warms up. I caught myself almost trying to chew this beer at times. So much flavor! 		Well balanced and smooth. Goes down pretty darn easy to say the least.";;;;;;;;;;
"First time trying Founders porter, never been let down with a founders beer, so lets see how this one goes Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a 5 ounce sampler mug.		A- Pours s deep dark black with one fingers worth of mocha head that dissapated to a thin layer that stayed till the end.		S- Full of dark rich roasted malts with some coffee and sweet caramel tones. Smells good.		T- Roasted coffee with coffee like bitterness at the end. Very true to the style, nothing very unique here just classic porter flavors done very well.		M- Medium body, very creamy with the right amount of carbonation.		D- For its style i find it pretty drinkable, if i had another one i would drink it.	 	Overall this another great beer by founders, one of the better porters i have had, will for sure be picking this one up again.";;;;;;;;;;
"From the first sip you know this is a great beer. Was slightly surprised at the lack of carbonation. It had practically no head. 		Very smooth with a distinct dark chocolate flavor. As someone else mentioned, almost no taste of oatmeal.		Very drinkable considering the alcohol content. You do notice a slight alcohol finish after it warms a bit.		Overall great beer.";;;;;;;;;;
"I can only imagine what this beer is like fresh. Because as it is this brew is rocking my world. Dark as a blackhole. I held a candle up to the pint glass and cannot even get the slightest shimmer through the beer. Thick black, creamy head on top. The glass was coated in lace that slowly oozed into a stringiness. Nose is loaded with dark chocolates, burnt malts and coffee.		Flavor is not so much complex as an intense wallop of coffee and dark chocolate. The coffee flavor is similar to when the pot is left a bit too long on the burner and the beer sours and bitters. Not too bad, but enough to notice. Also, if it is possible, I swear that in addition to the dark chocolate there is also a bit of white chocolate dribbled in the flavor. Not much in the way of any hops. Maybe a bit towards the end but I think I have that confused with the bitterness from the coffee and chocolate. Heavy and thick body that just clings to the cheeks like a nice dark roast. Quite relaxing and soothing too. Extremely smooth drinking, but just make sure you don't mind the taste of coffee in your beer.";;;;;;;;;;
Out of a 12 ounce bottle and into my nonic pint glass. The IPA appears a hazed apricot color with about an inch of fluffy off white foam. Flavors and aromas consist of grapefruit, orange, some pine, of course some caramel, tangerine peel, earthy. This IPA is medium in both body and carbonation with very little alcohol showing through. Nice stuff.;;;;;;;;;;
Pours a clear gold with some amber hues. Three + fingers of white head slowly dissipates to a finger's width of foamy capping with some good spotty lacing. Smells of honey, toasted grain, floral hops, and a touch of citrus. Tastes of citrus juice up front followed by grainy bread and a honey/caramel sweetness with just a touch of butter. Finishes with some dry grass and spicy hop bitterness. Medium in body with gentle carbonation. A tad bit watery in places, but overall balanced, solid, and smooth with a crisp dry finish. A pleasant pale ale that is easy to drink and quite sessionable. Very flavorful, and pretty IPA-ish for a Pale Ale, I like it!;;;;;;;;;;
I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers, but this O'Fallon offering does not disappoint. Lots of Peach aroma from this one, and a good - although not overpowering - peach taste. Poured into a pint glass and enjoyed with no complaints. Even the lady enjoyed this one - very light and had good drinkability. Some sediment pours with each bottle, similar to O'Fallon brews I've had in the past. Worth a few extra bucks to have a decent fruit beer if you can find it. I've never been disappointed by O'Fallon, although I've never been able to find their beer in great supply. A few six packs here and there is usually the case. This definitely stacks up well against some of the other summer brews...if only it was more widely available! I would like to see this offering on tap and compare to the bottle...;;;;;;;;;;
"Had this on tap in the Yazoo taproom from a pint glass.		Appearance is a very dark brown, almost black, with a small tan head.		Smell is of roasted malts, chocolate and spices. Nice malty aroma was very inviting.		Taste was rich and creamy, with strong malt flavor. Also tasted dark chocolate with a slight bitterness and spices that I assume come from the rye.		Mouthfeel was clean. The malty sweetness finishes with a slightly dry aftertaste.		Drinkability is very good. I could see having several of these in a row. A solid porter overall.";;;;;;;;;;
"Hazy golden sunshine color. Not much foamy head even with a vigorous pour. What head there is is dense and with good rentention through out.	Weak carbonation.		Heavy, heavy hop bouquet. Aromas of citrus and grapefruit hight light with a sutle earthy aroma present also. Malt plays second fiddle here with not much of a presence.		A bitter tasting beer without a strong hop flavor followed by a sweet cramel maltiness.		A medium to thick mouthfeel with a slightly dry finish and a bitter aftertaste that lingers along while.		Alcohol at almost 10% is well hidden and will definitly sneak up on you.		All in all a good beer. Could have some hop flavor.";;;;;;;;;;
"Gotta love trading!!		KBS is black with a tan head. Very little retention or lacing. Aromas are all vanilla and bourbon. They are heavy but most definitely inviting. Despite being hot (this is the most recent release and it's still very strong on the alcohol), the flavors are smooth, going down like a fine bourbon should. Vanilla, spice, and a bit of coffee bean. That is all, but that's not to say there isn't complexity. Everything here is so finely layered, while also pulling together to effectively create a delicious imperial stout that demands to be sipped on for dessert! Big body and low carbonation. I look forward to trying this again after a year or two. Age will do this beer some good.";;;;;;;;;;
"Note: this is the batch of Cerise Cassee brewed by Will Myers and Shaun Hill at Nrrebro in Copenhagen, Denmark and bottled for luggage export to the states. Thanks Shaun!		Pours a wonderfully full deep red color, almost like that of a light Pinot Noir, with very crisp clarity. A starched white 2 finger head foams up on top and rests with tiny bubbles until after a minute or so when it settles into a solid, velvety cap with strong edging and light lacing up the glass. Nice bottle conditioning.		The aroma is amazing, like a fresh baked sour cherry pie. Very reminiscent of New Glarus Belgian Red. Really nice bretty character balanced with the sweet fruit cherry flavors and a subtle lacto and acedic that gives a quenching tartness to the whole aroma. Cherries are the dominant character here with the additional funk and tartness making up a really well-rounded smell. 		The taste is also incredibly full and well-balanced. Sour cherry sweetness starts out followed by a touch of malty biscuit breadiness and then moves to a strongly sour-tart middle with some nail polish qualities. Finishes very tart and dry. The mouthfeel is crisp and dry when necessary but has a great sweetness that doesn't make the sour flavors too uncomfortable. Nice bottle carbonation that carries the beer all over the mouth.		I wish I had more bottles of this hanging around because this is an easy-drinking, exciting, and pleasing brew.";;;;;;;;;;
2004 bottle cellar by me for almost a year, consumed in June 2005. Pours a pencil-thin dark brown head over a syrupy thick and utterly pitch black liquid. Smells raisiny, molasses, licorice, and chocolate with a gentle sting of alcohol. Taste starts roast with a barely detectable underlying chocolate. The chocolate then rises and persists well into the aftertaste. is just a hint of cherry sour. As the beer warms, the roast grows stronger, but a caramel toffee rises, and helps with the transition from roast to chocolate. Overall, the beer is sweet, but the chocolate has dried out and the roast after the swallow lays dry on my tongue. A nice contrast with the sweet on my cheecks and back of my tongue. Thick mouthfeel and mildly carbonated.;;;;;;;;;;
"My Black Friday brew that I initially thought I was going to drink on Thanksgiving, but it turns out that I was on duty for work. However, it was well worth the wait. I've been sitting on this particular bottle for 1 and 1/2 years and it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Review is from notes taken on 11/26/2010 and poured from the bottle to a snifter.		Appearance: Pour is black like coffee and just looks thick and viscous on the pour; no head, just a thin, dark brown ring around the surface; body is, of course, 100% opaque and not even close to thinking about toying with the notion of allowing any light through; no lacing is left behind at all, just a bit of a thick and oily residue.		Smell: Oh my... Tons of rich, syrupy sweet and bittersweet chocolate malts; some dark and burnt/coffee-like maltiness with just a touch of smoke to them; definitely some dark cherry (actually really kind of reminds me of the gourmet chocolate covered cherries); definite presence of alcohol and just a touch of oaky vanilla; more barrel continues to come out as it warms, but it remains smooth and warming as opposed to caustic. Overall, the nose is awesome and wonderfully robust.		Taste: Quite nice! Starts off with a blend of smooth bourbon and a lot of the syrupy sweet and bittersweet chocolates that were first picked up in the nose, but the oatmeal is definitely present as well and it reminds me a bit of no-bake cookies; following the chocolate I really pick up on the roast and burnt espresso-esque maltiness that have a bit of an earthy bitterness to them; the dark fruity/cherry aspect is there, but a little more subdued by the up-front alcohol and oaty chocolates; as it continues to warm, the barrel continues to become more of a factor, as does a sweet caramel or butterscotch flavor. Really superb.		Mouthfeel: Still pretty thick and very smooth -- it feels like the barrel aging only took a bit from the body as I find they oxidize and thin out just a bit from the added exposure to the elements; carbonation is nearly a non-factor, but that's not entirely unexpected; a thick, syrupy coating is left on the mouth; bely is left quite warm from the bourbon presence and higher ABV.		Drinkability: This is really a great beer, and I am more than pleased; this bottle really held up and mellowed quite well and I'm glad I've got another one stashed away and am now considering dropping the coin for a new one that is currently sitting on the shelves; outstanding and robust scents and flavors; ABV is definitely a touch high, but this one mis made for sipping, not chugging. Cheers to Hoppin' Frog.";;;;;;;;;;
"Poured into my pint glass the ber is pitch black. The thick chocolate hued head towers at least three fingers high and refuses to settle. After an excruciating wait thick gobs of lace are left around the glass. A one inch cap rests on top of the beer and never leaves.		The aroma is pure chocolate coffee cake. Roast malt with hints of molasses and dark fruit. So simple yet so spectacular.		The flavor is a mirror of the nose. Milk chocolate, coffee, roast malt, and hints of molasses. After some warming the booze starts to come through but not enough to be off putting.		Full creamy body. Hardly a trace of carbonation.		Overall a great RIS. This one deserves to be talked about more. Unfortunately the other big beers at Founders garner most of the accolades.";;;;;;;;;;
"Appearance: Nice true amber red with a nice smallish sized head that doesn't dissipate.	Smell: Nice tangy cherry aroma that almost smells like a real cherry preserve.	Taste: Tangy sour and sweet at first sip. However, the sweetness is not artificial. These taste like true Michigan cherries and the beer has a bold/complex fruit flavor	Drinkability/Mouthfeel: Nice tickling carbonation and very easy on the palate. The main thing I liked was this ran the gambit of not being too sweet while still maintaining 6.5% alcohol.";;;;;;;;;;
"Bomber split between my wife and me, poured into a pint glass. Jet black with brown highlights. A thick creamy mocha head that left tons of lacing behind. Quintessential pretty stout appearance.		Aroma is mostly malt based -- roasted coffee sweetened with milk and 2 or 3 teaspoons of sugar. No hop presense in aroma, but the sweet coffee/chocolate combo is strong and very nice.		Taste is perfect for an export stout. Reminds me of my first Guinness when all Guinness in the states was their export stout. Big roasted malt flavors, lots of chocolate and coffee, more chocolate than coffee whereas coffee dominated smell. Really nice smack of bitterness in there too, which wasn't in the aroma. Plenty of sweetness -- close to cloying but not at all cloying. Really nice.		Mouthfeel is very full and chewy. A very drinkable stout. This was a bargain when I bought it in VA. I should have bought more. Excellent beer.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours the blackest of blacks with a nice very dark tan head that dissipated quickly, leaving some nice lacing on the glass. The smell is great. It smells of Dark malts, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and coffee. Tastes awesome. Coffee and chocolate, with the bourbon taste coming through well. There is also a nice sweetness to this beer that seems to stay in your mouth for a while. The mouthfeel is great for this type of beer. Very heavy body with low carbonation. Coats the mouth very well and really lets you taste the beer very well. The drinkability is very good with this beer even though it is definitely a slow sipper. It took me a long time to finish my glass of this, I had a great time doing it though. I really loved this beer and I think founders did a great job making it. This will be the perfect beer for the middle of winter. Great job founders. Cheers.;;;;;;;;;;
"I'm becoming less enamored with fruit and vegetable type beers, but the Cerise by Founders is the exception. I really enjoyed this spritzy little beer.		It pours a very carbonated and fizzy reddish color from the cherries of course, with not much white head or lacing. The nose was not overly fruity, a bit more subdued with vague hints of sweet malts, sweet florals, maybe a hint of yeastiness. The taste was just spritzy on the tongue, very cherry in flavor, lots of sweet seltzery cherry soda like flavors, with some solid malt underneath that gave it some body. This was just an enjoyable, not overly sour, not overly light, refreshing cherry seltzer like beer. It's worth seeking out.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to Zapata for the chance to sample		A_Pours a darker chestnut brown with a two finger cream couloured head. The staying power isn't a strong point.		S_A nice strong scent of deep rich and roasted caramel malt dominates the nose. A bit of praline sort of comes through as well.		T_Dryer than anticipated from the smell. Light caramel goes straight into a deep hazlenut and pecan finish. Not very deep as the flavour diminishes quickly. What aftertaste there is almost a sort of light nut brittle mixed with coffee. Hop bitterness is present throughout but nonexistant in the aroma. 		M_On the thinner side with a mild carbonation.		D_A nice nut brown that actually manages to taste fairly nutty. Very drinkable, I am sure I could knock a few back.";;;;;;;;;;
"Cloudy cider orange body with a thick brick of off-white foam; clouds of lacing and excellent duration leave me impressed right away. Good, hopped nose with no shortage of caramel malt. My initial impression is that the nose is sweet and floral, yet the smell becomes a bit harsher, more bitter as the beer proceeds. Good complexity.		This is a good, complex IPA--sweet to start, somewhat bitter and spicier later, lots of malt in between. I like the prominent citrus component, plenty of orange, melon, and a bit of lemon. I didn't expect such a malty IPA, yet here it is, smoother and creamier than I expected, resulting in a great mouthfeel.		This is one good, delicious IPA. Hoppin' Frog has again produced a gem of a beer, one fine IPA that shouldn't disappoint.";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks to beachbum1975 for this brew. He said it's been aged awhile in appropriate conditions so I'm not sure on the dating.		12oz. stubby brown bottle poured into a tulip.		A: Pours a motor oil black with similar viscosity. 1/2 finger head is very slow to form but holds decently well. Some patchy lacing.		S: Still has a pretty boozy twang around everything. Burnt malts and burnt coffee beans. Deeply cooked brown sugar and molasses.		T/M: Wow.. for as rich and robustly delicious as the alcohol is, it's completely mellow and just damn tasty.. Very tasty mocha espresso mixture. Some chocolate covered dark fruits and even a bit of citrus left. It feels like I'm drinking a slightly thinner melted espresso dark chocolate bar.		D: Wow... I can't wait until the new bottles come out this summer. Founders has got to be one of the best breweries out there.";;;;;;;;;;
"Maybe we got a revamped version of this beer as both sierrags and I are hopheads and it takes a good hoppy beer to please us....this was a GOOD hoppy beer.		A-Copper with a light tan head leaving nice lacing behind.		S-Sweet malts meld with the strong presence of citrus and floral hops.		T-Hoppy? Hell yeah! This is a citrus hop lovers beer for sure. Nice use of ""west-coast"" style hops for sure. Good malty backbone upholds the generous hop bill.		M-Medium body with a pleasant dry finish.		D-Really nice...with a name like Hoppy I was hoping B&F didnt disappoint....they didnt!";;;;;;;;;;
"Viggo was nice enough to share this one. thanks eric!		22oz bottle.		pours deep inky black. no light even sneaking through around the edges. a nice dense brown head rises up and very slowly falls leaving spotty lace behind.		aroma is great. nice roast. big bread and biscuit malts. alcohol. light anise. lots of caramel. bit of toffee. toasted multigrain bread. a bit of vanilla. dark chocolate.		taste is great. roast. bit of alcohol. big bread and biscuit malt. bittersweet and dark chocolate. touch of vanilla. caramel sweetness. coffee. toasted bread. hint of grain. medium-low bitterness level, mostly coming through as bakers chocolate. as it warms the alcohol comes through a little more, and it seems to get even more biscuit character.		mouthfeel is good. big and chewy, especially as it warms. slightly less than medium carbonation level works ok. just a touch of astringency.		drinkability is good. well balanced and very good. as it warms the alcohol comes out a bit more, but mostly as a little bit of warmth and isn't at all unpleasant. great stuff.";;;;;;;;;;
"Very nice pour. Deep ruby color, hazy, with a tight two-finger head.		Hoppy smell. Grapefruits and yeast. Dougy yeast. Nice.		Foamy, yeasty taste starting out. The hops, though strong, aren't harsh--they come in as citrus and grapfruit. It ends on more dry yeast. Bready. There's a great dry aftertaste, too. Complex and very, very good.		Honestly, I've never had a rye beer before, so I didn't know what to expect. I doubt they're all this good!";;;;;;;;;;
"Thanks goes out to kryptic for this brew.		Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some chocolate/toffee/coffee. The taste is sweet at first, then some nice malts, with the dark chocolates kick in. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice one, very tasty.";;;;;;;;;;
"Pours into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip with an almost two-finger thick, cocoa stained, dark tan colored head. The beer is a thick black color that shows no light through it. Ample roasted grain notes of black coffee and charcoal are joined by a sort of chalky note that is almost musty (though not quite). Dark chocolate aromas couple with a rich nuttiness and a solid toasted bread crust note are found just behind the huge coffee character that even provides a touch of tartness to the aroma. Despite being such a huge stout, this actually seems to be dominated by the coffee aromatics, though it is offset at times by the nice chocolate aromatics. I don't really get much in the way of Bourbon character in the aroma, which is actually a promising sign for me.		Thick and chewy up front, yet with such a huge roast malt and coffee character that it never becomes overly sweet. The beer finishes with a hit of Bourbon barrel flavors that provide a touch of vanilla and a deep buttery note that lingers for quite some time in the finish. Up front rich chocolate notes are quite noticeable (providing some balance to the roast character), these notes stick around some times through to the finish, where the Bourbon dominates, and are joined by a deep, toasted, nutty flavor. After the first sip, that initial wave of strong Bourbon notes seems to die down some; likely my palate just got used to it, but it becomes much more in balance with the rest of the beer. This definitely has a touch of tartness to it that is a result of both the ample burnt / roast notes (both coffee and grain) as well as some of the Bourbon influence. The finish also has a touch of hot Bourbon alcohol to it that is noticeable more as an aromatic oral nasal thing, but definitely makes me feel like I am exhaling alcohol.		At times a certain fruit character is noticeable that makes me think of sour prunes, figs and raisins; all of which have been left under the broiler to develop a bit of char. As the beer warms up and loses a bit of carbonation it becomes much more creamy textured and smooth, it also becomes much more mocha / chocolate flavored than it was previously, almost richly so.		I am not sure if my nose is not quite working tonight or what, but I am quite surprised how little of the Bourbon barrel influence is noticeable in the aroma. In the end the balance between roast character and smooth chocolate become really nice, the Bourbon barrel seems to meld into the background such that it supplies a nice complexity; so definitely serves this more towards 59F / 15C to get the best flavor balance. Much better and much more balanced than I was expecting; definitely a very good, moderate use of Bourbon Barrel character and coffee if drunk on the warm side.";;;;;;;;;;
"Had this at lunch at Kieran's Pub in Minneapolis. Very pleased to see it on the menu. Poured into a pilsner glass.		Appearance: Founder's Porter pours a very dark brown color, almost black, with about a finger of mocha colored head. Lacing is a moderate layer of fine film after it reduces.		Smell: Lots of roasted malts, some chocolate, and just a touch of smoke. It smells very rich. 		Taste: I've got to say this is one of the richest porters I've ever tried. Lost of roasted malts, chocolate, and vanilla. Classic porter taste, just great.		Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied with a little carbonation. Viscous, very smooth and creamy on the palate. Delightful. This is absolutely an awesome tasting porter. My favorite of the style that I've had.";;;;;;;;;;
"Served in a 12 oz. goblet at Haymarket. 		Hazy opaque orange body, slim cap of white foam that has a creamy surface texture, and leaves a nice collar of thin lacing around the edges. Retention is ok, it settles to a broken veil of skim after awhile. 		Big citrusy aroma, orange banana creamsicle. Light sweetness, with some fruity Belgian yeast character around the edges. Nice hop aromatics and yeast blending complimentary fruity notes.		Flavor is big on the citrus and banana also, very creamy with a smooth texture, lightly sweet with a low to moderate level of bitterness. Carbonation is soft, lending to the creaminess of this medium bodied DIPA. Some residual bitterness lingers in the aftertaste, only slightly drying, surprising given the (well-hidden) high ABV. Would drink again, definitely a solid Belgian DIPA from the Haymarket repertoire.";;;;;;;;;;
"A- Pours a nice dark tobacco color. with a 2 finger tan head. leaves nice lacing as well		S- Has a nice smoked aroma up front, i also smell some dark chocolate and carmel. As well as some roasted malts. The smell is quite nice		T- Alittle more sweet then i expectd from the aroma. It starts off with a nice chocolate carmel flavor and then its followed by a nice smokey tobacco flavor and then finish's with a nice roasted malts.		M-Medium to full bodied. Good carbonation		D-Overall this was a very drinkable and lovely brew. My mom was on the east coast and i told her to pick me up some wake n bake. No store had any but 1 store recommended this brew and said it was the closest they had. It def. filled my wake n bake void. I think wake n bake is better but this is pretty close. This is just a little more smokey and not as creamy. But overall this is a nice rich smokey beer that i will get again for sure.";;;;;;;;;;
Pours a hazy orange color with an cream colored two finger head that falls slowly. Some decent lace left down my goblet.;;Aroma is soft pine needles mingle with orange peel citrus on a sweet malt base. Aroma is nice but little on the subdued side for an IPA maybe.;;Taste is better not as subdued as smell hops biting on tongue right away aided by the carbonation. Pine resins mingle with citrus notes grapefruit rinds that leave some lingering bitterness on the tongue. Some toasted caramel malt sweetness but mostly just hops on the flavor side.;;Mouthfeel is light medium might seem lighter do to the CO2 pep I am picking up. Just a tad to much carbonation for my tastes not bad really but could be less.;;Drinkability is good a decent IPA not mind altering but worth a try for sure. Goes down easy enough.;;
"a: nice little off-white head, light amber in color, average retention		s: citrusy and young pine hops supported on a pale malt body, doesn't put much out there but it's certainly well constructed		m: carbonation just under medium, lighter in body and perhaps just a bit thin for my preference		t: simple but good, pale malts with only the lightest dose of caramel and a moderate citric hop profile with brushes of pine, finishing with a balanced bitterness		d: no problems here, very satisfying with a great balance and dry, hoppy finish		single from Market Street Wine, Charlottesville";;;;;;;;;;
